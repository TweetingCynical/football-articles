      "Mason Greenwood has been absent from international football for almost six years(Image: Photonews, Photonews via Getty Images)",
      "Mason Greenwood's success at club level has failed to replicate itself on the international stage. The ex-Manchester United striker has proved to be one of Ligue 1's most potent finishers since signing for Marseille in 2024.",
      "The 24-year-old won the league's Golden Boot last season, alongside Ousmane Dembele, with the pair both netting 21 goals. Greenwood has continued his form in front of goal during the current campaign, leading the league in scoring with 12 goals and netting 20 across all competitions.",
      "Prior to his £23million move to France, Greenwood was charged with rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour in 2022 before the charges were later dropped. Greenwood denied all allegations.",
      "During his time at United, he was regarded as a player who would star for club and country for years to come and even made his England debut in 2020 - his sole cap for the Three Lions.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! ** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "However, his legal issues ended his international career with England, and he has yet to be recalled to the squad. Ahead of Euro 2024, former national team boss Gareth Southgate said outright he wouldn't consider Greenwood, and current manager Thomas Tuchel previously admitted the forward was \"not in his thoughts\".",
      "The German said last year: \"I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought. He was not in the mix at the moment, and he is not in our thoughts for our team.\"",
      "Despite Greenwood filing papers in order to switch his international eligibility to Jamaica, he's yet to make his debut for the country, even after he was as expected to be available for selection for Jamaica's World Cup 2026 qualifiers against Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago last September.",
      "Mason Greenwood has not played for England since 2020(Image: PA)",
      "With 42 goals in 62 games for Marseille, Greenwood has certainly been a bargain for the French giants, who paid United an extra £5m last season due to clinching Champions League football.",
      "The financial victories from selling Greenwood could yet still continue for the Red Devils, who inserted a staggering 40 per cent sell-on clause in his Marseille contract. Should the Ligue 1 side sell him, United will receive almost half of the profit from the transfer fee.",
      "Thomas Tuchel previously admitted he has no plans to recall Greenwood to the England squad(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "After playing a part in his side's 2-1 win against Newcastle United in November, an English opponent awaits Greenwood again as Liverpool travel to the Stade Velodrome this Wednesday. The striker has scored just once against the Reds in five games, with his lone strike coming in a 3-2 win for United against their rivals in the FA Cup fourth round in 2021.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The days are ticking down in the January transfer window, with Manchester United among those actively looking in the market at potential deals. The club are weighing up options that could help them in the short term and the long term, with a particular focus on the groundwork that can be done for the summer.",
      "In the meantime, Michael Carrick will largely work with what he has to try and get Man United as high up the table as possible in his caretaker manager stint. That should help set the team up for the future, whether that is under the current staff at Old Trafford or under new leadership with a change in head coach.",
      "Either way, director of football Jason Wilcox is already starting to take a look at the options he can bring in to help improve the side in the weeks and months ahead. So, with that being said, here's a look at the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours ahead of another busy day.",
      "Manchester United could have a transfer battle on their hands if they push forward with their reported interest in Ruben Neves in the near future. According to Spanish outlet AS, Real Madrid are also taking a keen interest in the midfielder as a possible option for the summer transfer window, though the player is looking at a possible move in January.",
      "The former Wolves star is currently playing for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, but has just six months remaining on his contract with the club. That has sparked interest in a possible return to Europe, with the 28-year-old now entering what are the peak years of his playing career.",
      "A pre-contract agreement can be reached by clubs this month, up until he becomes a free agent in the summer, but it remains to be seen if any club will manage that. Man United's own interest comes at a time when they are keen to transform their midfield ranks, with Neves one of many potential targets.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek this January transfer window, as an option to improve their midfield ranks. That's reported by talkSPORT, who claim that the club are considering a potential loan signing in midfield this winter to help bolster their options.",
      "Loftus-Cheek is said to be keen on making a move back to the Premier League, having struggled to feature regularly for AC Milan this season. The former Chelsea man was involved for England last year, making his return after a few years out of the setup, but will be keen to play more before the World Cup.",
      "While Loftus-Cheek is one option, the report adds that former Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is also on Man United's radar this winter.",
      "Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a potential move for Jean-Philippe Mateta in the transfer window, but could miss out to Premier League rivals Aston Villa. That's because The Athletic reports that the Villans have expressed their interest in the striker this month.",
      "It's claimed that the club are looking to bolster their forward ranks, with Mateta an option as he enters the final 18 months of his deal at Crystal Palace. The Eagles hold their own interest in Evann Guessand, which could open the path towards a swap deal in the weeks ahead.",
      "That may well take away a potential option for Man United, if they are looking to act on their striker transfer interest this winter, or even in the summer. Palace boss Oliver Glasner admitted last week that the club are open to a sale if the financial interests come forward in the transfer market.",
      "\"There will be a price where Crystal Palace say '18 months left in his contract, we do the deal if JP wants',\" Glasner admitted. \"If nobody pays this price then JP will stay.\"",

      "The report adds that the Real Madrid board 'have doubts' over Neves and that the fact they would be able to land him on a free transfer in the summer means they would be unwilling to pay a substantial fee to sign him, making a deal unlikely.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "This impact became evident when Carrick took over as Middlesbrough boss in October 2022. One of his players that season, Chuba Akpom, revealed what his friend Sancho told him about the manager.",
      "Akpom, whose 28 goals that season made him the top scorer in the second tier, told club media: \"No [I wasn't concerned about Carrick's arrival], I was actually really excited because a good friend of mine is Jadon Sancho at Manchester United and he had nothing but good things to say about the manager, so I kind of knew already what to expect from the gaffer. But I didn't know it'd go this well.\"",

He briefly returned for the 2024 Community Shield but was soon on the way out again.",
      "Sancho, now 25 years of age, spent last term on loan at Chelsea but saw the Blues pay United £5m to get out of making his switch permanent. The winger has been on loan at Aston Villa since the beginning of this campaign and is anticipated to depart United in the summer when his existing contract runs out.",

      "Michael Carrick has received a word of advice(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Kleberson has explained that Manchester United would be wise to build their team around Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha, while also urging his former club not to spend big in the January transfer window. It looks to be a busy month for Michael Carrick at Old Trafford, who has stepped into an interim head coaching role until season's end.",
      "While his first game in charge saw the Red Devils run out 2-0 winners over Manchester City at the weekend, fans worldwide will be waiting patiently to see whether Carrick will be as active off the pitch. While a number of Premier League clubs have been linked with various arrivals and exits as of recent, the pace at United has been far slower.",
      "While there has been speculation on loan moves for Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, it seems as though both men are set to stay put for the rest of the season. Elsewhere, there has been very little talk of new arrivals, with Carrick looking increasingly likely to stick with his current crop of talent.",
      "\"If you try to bring someone now, probably those guys are going to be waiting for some coach leaving, so they can think, ‘Okay, now's the time to get it back.’ And then some guys get it and say, ‘Oh no, my gosh, that's my time, there’s someone coming now.’ I think they need to keep those guys, just put like a juice on those guys now.",
      "\"And then say, ‘Guys, it's with us, man. With us. Let's put everything we have, let's play for Reds, and then try to bring everything you can to win those games and finish the season in a good position for the club.'\"",
      "When asked if United should hold off on transfers until the summer, Kleberson called on Carrick to do just that and leave it to the club to sort at the end of the season when his contract ends.",
      "Kleberson responded: \"Exactly, because the mistakes are already made, you know what I mean? It's tough to fix now.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Elsewhere, Kleberson explained that the club should be looking to build around Fernandes and Cunha going forward, explaining how the two could be the key to turning the tide in the Premier League and Europe. When asked about how his compatriot is fairing since his summer transfer from Wolves, he said: \"I believe he's doing well, you know?",
      "\"The problem is when the team and club doesn't move well - it affects, unfortunately, the field. Even the players say, no, it doesn't affect the field, but it's unfortunately affecting. And then when he moved to United, he went with a lot of confidence.",
      "Kleberson has spoken about Manchester United(Image: Getty Images Sport)",
      "\"He played well in the beginning, he got back in the Brazilian national team. He played also so well in the Brazilian national team. He's a classic player. I think the combination he and Bruno is really good.",
      "\"I think United has to think, 'Who's the next player going to be around those two guys?'... The puzzle [of the team], they can get it closer together? And [when they do] then the seasons go really, really consistently because those two are really, really good players.\"",
      "At the time of writing, United sit fifth in the Premier League standings with nine wins, eight draws and five losses to show for their efforts this season. Up next is a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, January 25, to face Mikel Arteta's leading Arsenal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The 2-0 win has prompted calls for interim manager Michael Carrick to be in the mix to take the job permanently in the summer, though he isn't the only candidate.",

      "Neves' contract in Saudi Arabia expires in the summer but a January switch has been mooted to allow the Riyadh club to secure a transfer fee, potentially providing United with a cut-price option. However, AS reports that - while Neves is making clear his fondness for a Madrid switch - the club are less convinced.",

      "Man United are set to miss out on one transfer target(Image: (Photo by Darren Staples / AFP via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United's search for midfield reinforcements this summer could hit a snag regarding one potential target.",
      "According to The Sun, Premier League rivals Sunderland have no plans to sell United transfer target Noah Sadiki during the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old joined the 'Black Cats' last summer from Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise for approximately £15m, and has impressed since making the move.",
      "This has apparently caught the eye of Man United and their recruitment department, who have been scouting potential long-term successors for Casemiro as he enters the twilight of his Old Trafford career. Sadiki features on a shortlist of possible targets that includes Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson, all of whom have made strong starts to their Premier League careers in central midfield. Barcelona's Marc Casado has also been reported as a potential option in the past 24 hours.",
      "However, the Sunderland midfielder is apparently considered \"untouchable\", with no sum of money likely to persuade the Black Cats to sell the player, who is contracted until 2030. Earlier reports suggested that United were considering a swap arrangement that could have involved Manuel Ugarte departing the club, with the Uruguayan midfielder potentially leaving alongside a cash offer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, with that avenue now apparently closed off, the club's bosses will need to find alternative approaches to their transfer dealings. It also brings into question the future of Ugarte for United, just three transfer windows on from his sensational switch from PSG.",
      "Roughly £42m was paid in 2024 to land the Uruguayan international, who was viewed as an upgrade in the central ranks. He is yet to prove that in his time at Old Trafford, however, having become a squad player who has failed to stamp his mark on a starting place in the first-team.",
      "Former manager Ruben Amorim addressed the struggles that Ugarte faced back in November, when he said: \"No, I understand [Ugarte's performances]. You can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle, and they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment.",
      "\"But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change, and you saw it five weeks ago, the environment (at the club) was completely different. So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment, and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example, but it is a different world, and he needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JANUARY 11: Manuel Ugarte of Manchester United during the Emirates FA Cup Third Round match between Manchester United and Brighton & Hove Albion on January 11, 2026 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)(Image: (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images))",
      "Those struggles continued through the last two months of the manager's reign, up until his dismissal. It remains to be seen whether he can be given a new lease of life under a different set of management staff, or whether Ugarte now faces the real possibility of another transfer switch.",
      "Despite questions over the midfield, there is some optimism that, for now at least, Kobbie Mainoo can become pivotal to the team following his recent recall under caretaker manager Michael Carrick, before focus shifts to other midfield targets in the summer window. The academy product wasn't a regular in the starting XI under Amorim, which sparked discussions about a potential January departure to secure more playing time.",
      "Following the manager's eventual dismissal and the appointment of an interim boss, Mainoo has been given an instant second chance with a superb 90-minute display in the Manchester derby against Manchester City. \"I thought Kobbie [Mainoo] was great in there alongside Case [Casemiro],\" Carrick said in a glowing review of the youngster after the game.",
      "\"I thought between the two of them. I thought it gave us a strong foundation really with Licha [Lisandro Martinez] and Harry [Maguire]. I felt it was a game for experience and knowing what it feels like.\"",
      "Currently, it appears the preferred midfield setup could feature Mainoo and Casemiro in the holding roles, whilst club skipper Bruno Fernandes is deployed in the attacking midfielder position. That could well see Man United through to the end of the season in excellent form, but the broader view is of a team prepared to make a marquee signing in midfield going forward.",
      "Whether they settle on Wharton, Anderson, Baleba, or another player for the position remains to be seen, but it's obvious where the priority lies.",

      "Football legend David Beckham received a flood of congratulations last year when it was revealed he would be knighted. But his eldest son, Brooklyn, was notably silent.",
      "This action, or lack thereof, takes on new significance in light of Brooklyn's recent statement confirming his estrangement from the rest of the family. The 26-year-old shared a lengthy post on Monday saying he \"doesn't want to reconcile with his parents,\" accusing them of controlling him for most of his life and \"trying endlessly\" to separate him from his wife, Nicola.",
      "Speculation about a rift between the Beckhams and their eldest son has been rife over the past year. This latest development sheds more light on why Brooklyn didn't publicly acknowledge what his father described in two words as his \"proudest moment.\"",
      "Instead of commenting on his father's knighthood, the former Arsenal academy player posted an Instagram story promoting pretzel pita chips shortly after the announcement. Many online observers found it disrespectful that he remained silent on his father's significant achievement.",
      "It's understood Brooklyn and David did not discuss his inclusion in the Honours list. Moreover, it's believed Brooklyn found out about the award through the media, just like everyone else.",
      "Manchester United and England icon Beckham is said to have chased a knighthood for years before finally achieving his ambition. Leaked emails from 2017 appeared to reveal his blunt reaction after discovering he'd been snubbed yet again.",
      "Following his exclusion, Beckham reportedly let rip at the committee in a message to a colleague. His feelings were allegedly captured in two particularly harsh words as he's said to have branded the committee \"unappreciative c***s.\"",
      "If true, it offers a glimpse into a different facet of Beckham's character rarely displayed publicly. The former footballer turned model and Inter Miami co-owner is typically seen sporting his trademark smile and maintaining the heartthrob image he's cultivated over the years.",
      "Beckham finally got his wish after receiving his knighthood from King Charles last year(Image: PA)",
      "Yet Brooklyn's claims hint at other layers to both the 50-year-old and his wife, Victoria. In his public remarks, Brooklyn described multiple fraught episodes that prompted him to distance himself from his family.",
      "Beyond the purported controlling conduct and apparent grudge against his wife, Brooklyn recalled the turmoil surrounding their 2022 nuptials. It's claimed fashion entrepreneur Victoria had agreed to design Nicola's wedding gown, only to withdraw at the last minute, forcing her to scramble for a replacement.",
      "Brooklyn also slammed his mother for hijacking what should have been a romantic first dance with his wife. Instead, Victoria allegedly arranged it so she was positioned on the dance floor and \"danced very inappropriately\" with her eldest son.",
      "Brooklyn and David were believed to be close before the drama that's unfolded in recent years(Image: Getty)",
      "He continued by saying the episode left its mark and that he had \"never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in his entire life.\" The Daily Mail obtained a statement from wedding guest Stavros Agapiou, who backed up the account and confirmed Brooklyn is \"telling the truth.\"",
      "By opting not to publicly congratulate his dad on his knighthood, Brooklyn appeared to maintain his position in separating himself from the family \"brand.\" And it demonstrates just how furious he is with his father and mother during what was meant to be one of the happiest moments in their lives.",

Keane made the comments as Carrick, who joined United as a long-term successor to the Irish midfielder in the 2000s, began his role as United's interim manager for the second half of the season.",
      "\"Well his wife can always come in because she has got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She is probably doing the team talk,\" Keane said on Stick to Football.",
      "Keane has been a vocal critic of United's decision to appoint Carrick as Ruben Amorim's successor for the rest of the campaign. His comment about the Englishman's other half struck a chord in particular with former Ireland international Eamon Dunphy.",
      "\"Roy Keane greeted Michael Carrick's moment by having a go at Carrick's wife, Lisa,\" Dunphy wrote for the Irish Mirror. \"Keane is becoming an embarrassment - to football, to himself, and perhaps to Ireland.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Dunphy continued: \"This stems from a row between Carrick's wife and Keane back in 2014. But it is not right - ever - to attack a woman in a high-profile situation like this. It is cheap. It is lazy. And it is wrong.",
      "\"I feel ashamed for football, and for Ireland, because of Keane's antics. I feel for Carrick. He has taken on a big job at Old Trafford. He is trying to rebuild something meaningful. Keane, meanwhile, is doing adverts where he insults people for money, becoming a parody of the figure he once was.",

      "On the pitch, Carrick kicked off his tenure with a dominant victory over Manchester City in the Premier League.

Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu sealed victory, but the home side also had further goals ruled out, while City's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma helped keep the score down.",
      "\"Obviously, we had things we wanted to achieve in the game and the boys took it on but tactics are one thing and words another,\" Carrick said when asked about the win. \"You've got to put it on and make it happen, bring it live and everything today was spot on.",
      "\"Listen, I'm not going to say too much out of respect for [City manager] Pep Guardiola, he's such an unbelievable, incredible coach and they're such a good team. So it's not for me to pick them apart publicly. I think I wanted us to play to our strengths. We needed to be compact and needed the distances as short as possible between the units and between the positions.",
      "\"We needed to move as a team and, a few times, it got a little bit opened up but we still looked dangerous and I thought the front line were fantastic. It was everything what we would hope for, hence getting the good result.\"",

      "Rumours have resurfaced about Manchester United seeking new investment(Image: PA)",
      "Any prospective owners or investors in Manchester United would have to grapple with the club's staggering valuation if they wish to seal a deal. The Glazer family, who are the majority owners of United, have been on the receiving end of intense backlash from fans for their stewardship of the club since the Reds' leveraged buyout in 2005 saddled it with significant debt - currently estimated at around £1.29 billion.",
      "British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 per cent stake in United in a £1.25 billion deal at the start of 2024, following an agreement with the Glazers. The Ineos founder was granted control over footballing and strategic matters at the club; however, there is still chatter about potential investment at Old Trafford as future plans are being formulated.",
      "But former Premier League club chief executive Keith Wyness has recently expressed scepticism about new investment and believes the Glazers will have had talks. The ex-Everton and Aston Villa CEO suggests that Ratcliffe may have little influence in any potential takeover discussions at United and believes further investment will aid them in financing their new stadium project.",
      "Any potential interest would have to take into account the club's jaw-dropping value - currently estimated by Forbes at $6.6bn (£4.9bn) in May last year. This valuation places United second on the global list of clubs, trailing only Real Madrid at $6.7bn.",
      "In 2023, the Glazers were in discussions with Qatari billionaire Sheikh Jassim about a potential takeover, with the Nine Two Foundation established to facilitate the deal.",
      "A statement at the time declared: \"Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani today [Friday February 17] confirmed his submission of a bid for 100 per cent of Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch, and - above all - will seek to place the fans at the heart of Manchester United Football Club once more.",
      "\"The bid will be completely debt free via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation, which will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",

      "Updates on United's stadium plans, which were confirmed in March last year, have been few and far between since the turn of the year, with the club still considering designs, funding and working on an agreement to buy the land around their current ground.",
      "The club's chief operating officer, Collette Roche, did, however, reveal some news last month, saying: “Constructive discussions are continuing with landowners around Old Trafford as we seek to assemble the land required to build a new stadium.",

      "The Brazilian gem, who also holds a Croatian passport, has just completed a transfer from Dinamo Zagreb to NK Kustosija.",
      "Sources close to the teenager believe he is widely regarded as among the best 2009-born talents in all of world football.",
      "The reason Belinho has just signed with NK Kustosija is that he was not prepared to pen a long-term professional contract with Dinamo which would have kept him at the club for at least three years with the option of a further two.",
      "The idea is that at NK Kustosija, whose U19 side also play in the top tier of Croatian football, he'll be able to develop freely and then move onto one of Europe's elite clubs once he's turned 18.",
      "Belinho's agent Andy Bara is an investor at NK Kustosija and has already moved two players, Mika Faye and Lovro Chelfi, from the Croatian third-tier club to Barcelona.",
      "Arsenal, United, Barca and Real Madrid are all aware of the player and are continuing to monitor his progress closely. Brexit regulations would prevent Belinho from officially moving to the Premier League until he has turned 18 next January, however, English clubs can still pounce to sign him, should they wish.",
      "Discussions were centred around a development plan and refining a pathway but other clubs are also expected to present their project to the starlet and his family before any big decision is made.",
      "Barcelona sporting director Deco is a huge admirer of the player and has a great working professional relationship with Belinho's agents.",

      "While Liverpool's bid remains undisclosed, it's reported that United have put forward around £400,000 plus significant add-ons. Chelsea, on the other hand, are said to be gearing up to offer £600,000, along with substantial performance-related bonuses as per the same report.",
      "Alao's decision will likely hinge on the career opportunities that the interested clubs can provide. His rise at Sheffield Wednesday comes amidst a period of instability for the club.",
      "The Owls were plunged into administration last October and have been hit with an 18-point deduction by the EFL. The financial turmoil has also resulted in unpaid wages and the club having to rely on young players to fulfil their Championship fixtures.",
      "A consortium spearheaded by James Bord has been chosen as the preferred bidder, bringing a takeover one step closer. The process is now awaiting final approval.",
      "Currently, Wednesday find themselves languishing at the bottom of the Championship table, with a dismal -7 points. Alao has been handed an opportunity following Harry Amass' return to Manchester United.",
      "The left-back spent the first half of the season on loan with the Owls, where he impressed with his performances. He has since returned to Old Traffor,d where a decision will be made over his short-term future.",

      "Players such as Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa have been rumoured to be on their way out but a move this month seems some way off at present. So far, the only confirmed departure at Liverpool is young talent James Norris, who moved to Shelbourne on New Year's Day.",
      "United haven't been involved in any January deals yet, with no incomings and no outgoings. Toby Colleyer's return from his loan at West Brom is the only thing of note that has been confirmed this month, despite persistent rumours linking United with the likes of Ruben Neves, Joao Gomes, Yan Dimonade and Barcelona star Marc Casado.",

Michael Carrick, currently holding the reins at Old Trafford on an interim basis, got off to a flying start with a 2-0 victory over Manchester City.",
      "It's thought that the former United midfielder will remain in charge for the rest of the season before a permanent successor is appointed. Names such as Thomas Tuchel, Eddie Howe and Roberto De Zerbi have been floated as possible contenders.",

      "\"The Simeone one is really interesting,\" he commented. \"We've just had a chat about DNA. But it's interesting that Roy, who loves the club, and Gary, the same, have both mentioned Diego Simeone at different points in the last 4 or 5 months, that they wouldn't mind seeing him at Man United.",

      "One of the lesser-seen obstacles for a football club owner comes when you're forced to deliver bad news to a close friend. That's what happened to David Beckham at Inter Miami when the time came to tell Phil Neville he was getting sacked as manager.",
      "Beckham and Neville were the best of friends during their playing days at Manchester United, breaking into the first team in the 1990s after both coming through United's academy. The pair were reunited in Florida after Beckham took ownership of the club, with Neville appointed as manager for their second Major League Soccer season in 2021.",
      "Inter Miami finished 11th in the Eastern Conference in Neville's first season at the helm, despite boasting talents including World Cup-winning midfielder Blaise Matuidi and former Real Madrid and Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain. They made the post-season play-offs in 2022 but lost to New York City in the first round.",
      "Neville was granted a number of new signings in the close season, including former MLS top scorer Josef Martinez. Results didn't improve, though, leaving Beckham with a tough decision to make.",
      "\"Football management is temporary, we know at some point you're going to be moved on. That was my reason for being nervous when you took that job,\" Neville's older brother Gary told his sibling on It's Called Soccer! in 2024. \"Did you think about that at the beginning or did you just see it as an unbelievable opportunity?\"",
      "Phil replied: \"[It was] both, really. The big thing is that you're not just losing a football game but you feel like you're letting a friend down as well. Becks is really strong, he doesn't buckle and he's really loyal to the people he's close to.\"",
      "When reflecting on his sacking specifically, he said: \"The day I actually got fired was probably actually harder for David than it was for me. He really didn't want to do it, he was really emotional. I was emotional too but I knew it was coming so it was probably easier for me.\"",
      "Beckham's Inter Miami franchise would go on to win MLS Cup without Neville in 2025(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Inter Miami had won just five of their first 15 league games when Beckham approved a change of manager. Tata Martino took over midway through the 2023 season, when even the summer additions of Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets weren't enough to drag them back into the play-offs.",
      "It was a different story in 2024, though, with Martino leading the team to the Supporters' Shield - awarded to the team that finishes top in the regular season - but falling short in the play-offs. His successor, Javier Mascherano, finally delivered the club a first MLS Cup triumph in 2025.",
      "Phil Neville wasn't deterred from pursuing his managerial dream by the way things ended in Miami. He took over at Portland Timbers just months later and has led the club to the play-offs in each of his first two seasons.",

      "Ruben Amorim insisted on doing everything his way at Manchester United, which meant he ignored some easy wins, like making the effort to attend an academy game to show support for the club's young players. Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Michael Carrick was appointed as interim last week and attended an Under-21 match just seven days later, sitting alongside Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion. Jason Wilcox, director of football, and head of the academy, Stephen Torpey, were present, while Darren Fletcher also attended after returning to his role as Under-18 following a brief stint as caretaker.",
      "It might not seem important that Carrick and his backroom staff made the effort to attend, but the truth is their presence is a symbol of support for the youth system and highlights that there is a pathway. Carrick planned to speak to the Under-21s after their game against Sporting Lisbon, another classy touch from United's interim head coach. Some academy players were disillusioned with Amorim's comments in the media, but Carrick has sought to provide encouragement in his first week in the job.",
      "Fletcher spoke passionately as he defended the academy in a recent press conference, and Carrick is expected to pick up that baton, despite only having assurances of the job until the end of the season for now. Carrick made 464 United appearances and understands the club's finest teams across the decades have included academy players. Followers of the academy argued that understanding was not there with Amorim.",
      "Carrick made an effort to attend the game.(Image: )",
      "Amorim overstepped the mark when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship, pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game and namedropped Toby Collyer unprompted. The level-headed Carrick is guaranteed not to make such headlines.",
      "And Carrick was treated to a thoroughly entertaining first half at Leigh Sports Village, which saw James Scanlon score twice to give United a 2-1 advantage against Sporting. Woodgate was spotted pointing at the team sheet at the interval and might well have been saying 'the goalscorer looks like a good player'.",
      "Scanlon has already made a handful of senior international appearances for Gibraltar, who he qualifies to represent through his mother, and he has clearly outgrown academy football, which was further illustrated by him completing his hat-trick in the second half with a clinical finish in the box. Torpey is looking after loans after Evans' decision to step down from his role as head of loans and pathways, and he should arrange a move away for Scanlon before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Tyler Fredricson wore the captain's armband against Sporting, a few days after sitting alongside Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt to watch the Manchester derby in the directors' box. From the players who started against Sporting, Fredricson is another obvious candidate for a loan in the second half of the campaign. The youngster has been given just two first-team minutes since being hooked against Grimsby Town in August and would benefit from playing in a competitive environment.",
      "Scanlon scored a hat-trick against Sporting.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick got a first glimpse of the Fletcher brothers in action. Jack Fletcher played from the bench in successive Premier League games against Aston Villa, Newcastle and Wolves in December, and he would have seen Sporting as an audition for further opportunities now Carrick has taken charge of the team.",
      "Tyler Fletcher has made three matchday squads in the Premier League without getting a chance to make his debut. He will look at what his twin brother has achieved and be motivated to do the same.",
      "It will be interesting to see how much Carrick uses academy prospects, given he has a practically full-strength squad at his disposal and just 16 games remaining in the topflight this season.",
      "Only the best young players from the academy will be able to earn minutes and Shea Lacey is the favourite to stay around Carrick's senior squad. He was not involved against Sporting after training with the first-team at Carrington, and he currently has the wind behind his sails after two bright cameos.",
      "United ultimately claimed a 3-2 victory against Sporting, but they will only learn whether they progress to the knockout rounds of the Premier League International Cup when the remaining group games are played. Carrick was at least treated to a five-goal thriller and a hat-trick from the talented Scanlon at Leigh.",

      "Carrick was joined by his assistant, Steve Holland, and first-team coaches Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion, who all sat together in a suite at Leigh Sports Village.",

      "The teams are split into four groups, each comprising four English sides and four teams from Europe, which means United will face European opposition in every group match. The two best-placed teams in each group qualify for the quarter-finals.",
      "The U21s got off to a winning start in the competition when they played Athletic Bilbao in September, winning 2-1 thanks to goals from James Scanlon and Gabriele Biancheri.

      "Sporting are playing with a low block and have been hard to break down in the last 10 minutes.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has ended up in a war of words with two former Manchester United greats(Image: )",
      "The Gary Nevilles are at it again. Okay, this time it wasn't actually Neville who incurred the wrath of people at Manchester United, but the podcast personality and once-upon-a-time right-back was used as shorthand in Ruben Amorim's final press conference, and we all know who and what he means.",
      "Podcast culture is the latest battleground between the modern-day United and its greats of the past and no club seems to have it quite as bad. When the Class of '92 came towards the end of their playing days, there was always going to be intrigue at what comes next, but nobody had annoying podcasters on their bingo card.",
      "That is how they are often viewed at United, and the style of a podcast - lighthearted, engaging, different - is causing another pinchpoint. Just witness the war of words between Lisandro Martinez and Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes over the past few days as an example.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "If Martinez thought his forthright response after Saturday's derby day victory would be the end of it, he was mistaken. Butt and Scholes escalated the drama on Monday in the latest edition of The Good, The Bad & The Football.",
      "The former United midfielders tore into Martinez for having the temerity to hit back at what he clearly felt were disrespectful comments about how Erling Haaland would bully him at Old Trafford on Sunday. Part of the issue here is the format. Podcasts are different to TV analysis, and the market is so saturated that you have to stand out.",
      "As Butt said, the comments about Haaland picking Martinez up and running with him clearly weren't serious. It's the kind of thing you can't say on TV or radio, but can on a podcast. It's supposed to be funny. If anything, the biggest problem with those comments was their inaccuracy. Martinez has had several excellent games against Haaland in the past.",
      "Now that the Argentine has responded, Butt is telling him to \"f***ing grow up\". Scholes, it should be said, was much more measured, but there is no doubt the fanbase is firmly in the corner of Martinez here.",
      "Discontent at former players throwing out digs in the media has been rising recently. Podcast sofas, radio booths and pundit chairs are stacked with Old Trafford title-winners and all of them are competing to get that viral clip on social media.",
      "But here's the thing. Supporters would have a great deal more respect for the likes of Butt and Scholes if they turned their attention to the real problem at Old Trafford: an ownership regime that continues to hold the club back. The shoddy mistakes under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the years of waste under the Glazers are a far bigger problem than whether Martinez is tall enough to mark Haaland.",
      "On this subject, they are often quiet. There was a period around the European Super League when criticism grew, and Neville has raised it occasionally since, but for others, it seems to be a topic they are desperate to avoid. Far easier to take shots at the current players.",
      "Scholes said in 2023 that the Glazers had backed every manager they had hired at Old Trafford, which is a very basic view of a club that has been less than the sum of its parts and rarely invested at the right times. Butt spent nine years of his post-playing career at United before leaving, and three years ago, he said he was \"sick of people upstairs telling me about football.\"",
      "There is still an opportunity to go further, however. The ownership structure at Old Trafford remains a mess and further protests are planned at the next home game. The idea of Ratcliffe and the Glazers working together to deliver success feels unlikely.",
      "Ahead of that Fulham fixture, it will be interesting to see whether the club's former players confront the elephant in the room. Martinez vs Butt and Scholes has been great drama and I'm sure their numbers will have gone up this week. But many United fans would like to hear their views on the owners as well as the players.",

      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" said Amorim. The bruising quote was splashed on back pages and spread like wildfire on social media.",

      "When Amorim was sacked at the beginning of the month, his ruthless comment about Dorgu was cited by United sources, who admitted that senior club figures had been unhappy with it.",
      "Amorim's forthright nature was brilliant for journalists, who were guaranteed a headline when he spoke, but less so for the people who mattered. The 40-year-old had a sharp tongue and was not afraid to speak his mind, which eventually led to talking himself out of a job after a final bombshell at Elland Road.",

      "The message spoke volumes about Dorgu's maturity - and there are further examples. Last season, United were awarded a penalty against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, but Dorgu tried to overturn the decision himself with the referee while it was checked by VAR because he hadn't been fouled.",
      "During the recent 2-2 draw against Burnley at Turf Moor, Dorgu just got on with it after being stamped on by Kyle Walker, when performing theatrics would have seen Walker sent off.",
      "Dorgu has character and demonstrated steeliness to shake off Amorim's criticism in November, which might have caused greater harm to a 21-year-old without the same mental fortitude.",
      "Dorgu has responded to Amorim's criticism.(Image: 2026 Simon Stacpoole/Offside)",
      "Instead of sulking, Dorgu has trained to prove Amorim wrong. A source said the Dane \"does loads of extras\" and credited him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crosses, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The Denmark international knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed two goals and two assists in six games, representing his hottest run of form yet since his transfer from Lecce.",
      "Dorgu provided a brilliant assist for Matheus Cunha at Villa Park, and he built on that performance by scoring a superb volley in a gritty 1-0 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Following the Newcastle victory, he spoke to reporters and was asked how he dealt with Amorim's criticism, saying: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player. And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Dorgu added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up. My teammates help me as well.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, along with other members of United's senior leadership group, spoke to Dorgu after Amorim's press conference comment and he received support from the players he is closest to in the United dressing room - Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Dorgu and Hojlund pictured at Carrington in July.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Dorgu should feel more secure at Old Trafford after an encouraging month. There were growing doubts about whether he was cut out for United, but he has shown his mettle by delivering improved performances.",
      "He has looked at home playing on the wing, which started against Newcastle when Amorim played him on the flank. Newcastle's analysts in the press box were audibly confused at the start of the game, trying to work out where Dorgu was playing, and he popped up with the matchwinner.",
      "But Dorgu's recent performances on the wing may even surprise the data boffins who recommended his transfer from Lecce, as he has taken to the role like a duck to water.",
      "(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "It helps that Dorgu briefly played on the wing for Lecce, but performing in the Premier League is a different kettle of fish. He is learning on the job at one of the most scrutinised institutions in the world, and it shouldn't be forgotten that he's only just turned 21.",
      "Dorgu's goal against Manchester City was further evidence of his progress. He was picked to start in a striker-less front free by Michael Carrick, who preferred him to Cunha, and he vindicated that selection.",
      "\"I think Cunha did the hard work,\" Dorgu modestly told MUTV about his goal. “I just believed in my teammate that he would put a good ball in there, and I just closed my eyes and hoped to win.”",
      "Dorgu has gradually found his feet in Manchester, settling in the city without family joining him. Throughout the summer, staff noticed a difference in him, noting his confidence had grown after a challenging first few months at the club, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "Dorgu's confidence should receive another boost after his Manchester derby goal. He does not look very anxious any more.",

      "Diogo Dalot avoided a red card during Manchester United's win over Manchester City(Image: )",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb remains unsure if Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku had enough force to warrant a red card in the Manchester derby, but believes VAR applied the correct process to reach the decision not to send the defender off.",
      "It came just 10 minutes into the clash between Manchester United and Manchester City, when the Portuguese international's tackle saw his boot land high on the leg of his counterpart.",
      "The on-pitch decision by referee Anthony Taylor was that of a foul, but with the belief that it only warranted a yellow card, rather than a straight red for serious foul play.",
      "VAR checked the challenge and came to the conclusion that the tackle wasn't worthy of a red card, with the audio confirming the thought process behind that call.",
      "Match Officials Mic'd Up showed insight into the audio, as Taylor said: \"I'm going yellow card, it's a glance.\" before the VAR, Craig Pawson responded: \"Yeah, he does, he's glancing contact on the knee.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"There's no force, but there is glancing contact. He's tried to play the ball, and he catches it with glancing contact. Glancing contact, there's no force. He's tried to play the ball, he flicks, he misses the ball, he catches him with a follow-through. I'm happy to confirm the on-field decision.\"",
      "Discussions followed between Pawson and his assistant, Adrian Holmes, about the speed of the contact, but they ultimately decided to stick with the on-field decision.",
      "Pawson confirmed: \"Yeah. Tayls [Anthony Taylor] confirming the yellow card for Manchester United 2 [Diogo Dalot]. He tries to play the ball, he misses it, and then he makes glancing contact onto the knee. There's no force or intensity, but he does catch him with a follow-through.\"",
      "It was a process that Webb believes is the right one, as he said on Match Officials Mic'd Up: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He continued: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",
      "\"I think there is a mix, and therefore in this situation, it was right to leave it as the referee's call. If a red had been given, I would have expected the red card to stand as well, in the same way.\"",
      "It was a moment in the match that certainly changed things, as Man United went on to cause chaos over Man City, picking up a 2-0 victory that could've ended with more goals in their favour.",
      "Despite that, Pep Guardiola was keen not to use it as an excuse for the performance, which saw his side drop one point on their title rivals Arsenal over the weekend.",
      "\"You could say that, you could say that red card, different game. Many, many situations happen,\" the Man City boss told the press after the game.",
      "\"It is easy for me to come here and say it should be a red card. It is not about that; we will not grow up if that is the argument to win or lose a game. You have to do better, and we didn't today.\"",
      "While Guardiola was dismissive of the challenge, many of the pundits believed that it was the wrong decision not to brandish a red card to Dalot on the day.",
      "The likes of Alan Shearer and Roy Keane claimed that the tackle warranted a sending off, but Webb has made it clear that it was a subjective decision that followed the right process, regardless of the outcome.",

      "Lisandro Martinez said Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt can \"come to his house\" if they \"want to say something\" to him. Martinez was criticised by the former Manchester United pair in the build-up to the Manchester derby, but he delivered an exceptional performance to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, Butt said that he wasn't looking forward to watching United's younger players play against Erling Haaland in the Manchester derby. Scholes intervened, adding \"Martinez against Haaland,\" before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” Scholes added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "City recorded only one shot on target at Old Trafford and Martinez delivered a superb display alongside Harry Maguire to keep Haaland, Antoine Semenyo and Jeremy Doku quiet.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Martinez spoke to reporters after the full-time whistle at Old Trafford and was asked about the comments from Butt and Scholes. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants,\" he said.",
      "\"To my house, wherever. I don't care. And I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you sit here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Martinez was superb in the derby.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick made the dream start to his interim manager spell following his appointment on Tuesday, and Martinez credited the former midfielder with reminding the players what it means to play for United.",
      "\"So different, so different,\" Martinez said of the training sessions since Carrick's return. \"Different mentality, different guy. He knows what it really means, this club.",
      "\"He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He's a big legend. He wants to help the club, and I think we were in a tough situation, and today was the best moment to change that.\"",

      "Carrick praised Martinez and Maguire for providing a solid defensive foundation in his post-match press conference. \"I've known him for a long time and we speak a lot,\" Martinez said about Maguire. \"Today we had really good communication on the pitch - but not just only with H. The team today was different. It was different. When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "Martinez also believed the way the team fought helped the atmosphere. \"It's about the connection. It's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us,\" he said.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us a good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United. And I can really understand because sometimes it's like, what are we doing here? And today is the standard for this club.",
      "\"I don't put focus on the result. I just put focus on the performance, the connection with the people, the connection with the team. You see today that, and I think they don't have a shot at the goal today. One shot, well, just one. And you can feel the mentality. You can feel something different. I'm happy with that.\"",

      "Michael Carrick oversaw a special win.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Throughout Ruben Amorim's time at Old Trafford the same question was asked: Would Manchester United improve if they weren't playing with three at the back? That debate was put to bed in the Manchester derby.",
      "Darren Fletcher reverted to a back four during his brief caretaker stint in games against Burnley and Brighton, and there were green shoots of promise, and United's superb performance against Manchester City confirmed what most suspected - the squad is better suited to a different formation.",
      "Amorim was wedded to his formation and was sacked amid rising tensions at the club, with the friction developing between himself and Jason Wilcox.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick has used a 4-2-3-1 throughout his short managerial career and it's a formation that suits the current squad down to the ground. The players looked unshackled and started well. The crowd responded, generating noise due to the front-footed approach on the pitch.",
      "United started games far too slowly with Amorim in charge and Carrick addressed that issue. Of course, intensity is expected in the Manchester derby, but the team's shape helped United to make an improved start.",
      "Carrick picked a striker-less front three, which felt like a risk given Benjamin Sesko's form, but City struggled to get to grips with a pacey and unpredictable attack of Patrick Dorgu, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was relocated to his strongest position. Fernandes has been the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, having thrived around the opposition box, scoring plenty of goals and contributing assists, but Amorim's system saw him play in a deeper midfield position.",
      "Fernandes was still able to perform well in that deeper role, a testament to his quality, but you don't need coaching badges to conclude he is most effective playing closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Carrick's formation allows Fernandes to play behind the forwards - where he is most dangerous. And he almost scored against City, being flagged offside by a whisker after finding the net in the first half.",
      "The formation looked an upgrade in every aspect and United fans applauded their team off the pitch at the interval. Carrick would have sensed an opportunity, and he was jumping on the touchline just after the hour mark when Mbeumo fired United into the lead after a spell of pressure.",
      "It was a ruthless United counter-attack. Fernandes carried it forward, he had the pick of each forward ahead of him, and Mbeumo struck the ball first time to finish into the bottom right corner.",
      "It was the kind of goal that United would not have scored with Amorim in charge because his formation was rarely conducive to creating such opportunities. In truth, it rarely created any chances at all.",
      "United had recorded eight shots, six of which were on target, with 20 minutes remaining, which represented a huge tactical victory for Carrick and his newly-appointed backroom staff.",
      "Steve Holland is expected to be a brilliant appointment and he celebrated with Carrick when Mbeumo scored at the Sretford End. Amorim oversaw a 2-1 victory against City in December 2024, but he relied on an individual to secure the result, as Amad single-handedly turned the game on its head.",
      "Carrick's emphatic win in the Manchester derby was different. It was a tactical success, vindication for axing a manager and hiring a coach who plays with four at the back.",
      "Amorim's system ultimately held United back.",

      "Manchester United's January transfer window was always going to be quieter than a lot of their Premier League rivals'. This is, after all, the stance United have insisted they will stick by throughout.",
      "Michael Carrick will likely have to work with the current group of players available to him for the remainder of the season. There is merit in continuing with the same group and not risking upsetting the dressing room mid-season, but United might have missed out on a golden opportunity to sell one player.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee jumped at the chance to move to Old Trafford in 2024, and who could blame him? When the team needed an experienced goalscorer, the move did raise a few eyebrows. It soon became apparent Zirkzee was not the answer to United's goalscoring problems but, to his credit, the Dutchman continued to battle for his spot.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "After being unfairly jeered off the pitch against Newcastle little over a year ago, Zirkzee showed signs of improvement, particularly in the deeper No.10 role. However, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have seen him drop down the pecking order for that position.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's injury after the Tottenham draw gave him the chance to stake a claim for the striker role in the starting XI but it is clear United need an upgrade on Zirkzee. Now Ruben Amorim has gone and United are likely going to stick with a 4-2-3-1 formation for the remainder of the season, Zirkzee's opportunities are going to become even more limited.",
      "That is why it made sense for the Reds to sell Zirkzee in January, even if they were not going to sign an immediate replacement. AS Roma were keen on bringing the Dutchman in thanks to his experience in Serie A and the limited options available in the market.",
      "Instead, the Italian club have moved on to a new target and got that deal done. Aston Villa's Donyell Malen has joined them on loan with a fee of £21.6m agreed for the summer. Roma are now highly unlikely to re-enter the race for Zirkzee this window.",
      "Missing the chance to sell Zirkzee in January when there was a suitor keen on his services could come back to bite United. Another half season with the Dutchman rarely playing is only going to lower his price tag further.",

      "Paul Scholes has clapped back at Lisandro Martinez after the Manchester United defender lashed out at the Old Trafford icon's comments. Martinez told Scholes that he should criticise him to his face and come to his house after the former United midfielder's jibes leading into the Manchester derby.",
      "Scholes appears happy to accept the invitation. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar pls @lisandromartinezzz\" said Scholes on his Instagram story.",
      "Martinez put in an impressive outing in Michael Carrick's first match in charge to keep a clean sheet alongside Senne Lammens, Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. The 2-0 win was well deserved and Martinez wasn't about to brush off words from United legend's following the victory.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the full-time whistle of United's impressive derby win, the defender was asked about comments from Nicky Butt and Scholes.",
      "\"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants,\" Martinez said.",
      "\"To my house, wherever. I don't care. And I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you sit here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So, for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When asked whether such comments provide motivation, Martinez calmly responded: \"No, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes and former team-mate Butt did not paint a flattering picture of Martinez's chances against Erling Haaland. Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, Butt said that he wasn't looking forward to watching United's younger players play against Erling Haaland in the Manchester derby.",
      "Scholes intervened, adding \"Martinez against Haaland,\" before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?\"",
      "Scholes added: \"He’d score, then throw him in the net.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez of Manchester United(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "Martinez was happy with his side's commitment against City and believes they can feed into the Old Trafford atmosphere if they can continue to play in a blood an guts manner this season. \"It's about the connection,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us a good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United. And I can really understand because sometimes it's like, what are we doing here? And today is the standard for this club.",
      "\"I don't put focus on the result. I just put focus on the performance, the connection with the people, the connection with the team. You see today that, and I think they don't have a shot at the goal today. One shot, well, just one. And you can feel the mentality. You can feel something different. I'm happy with that.\"",

      "Michael Carrick salutes the Stretford End after Manchester United defeat Manchester City 2-0(Image: Joe Prior/Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "When Michael Carrick went to bed on Friday evening, he would have dreamt about the ideal start as Manchester United interim head coach. That dream became a reality on Saturday as the Reds banished the memory of a 3-0 defeat in September's reverse fixture in brilliant fashion at Old Trafford.",
      "The mood had once again been lifted at Old Trafford prior to kick off thanks mostly due to the opponents. No matter how bad the form or performances are for United, a game against Manchester City is always enough to rally the troops and so it proved with the home fans keen to make the stadium a cauldron before kick off.",
      "Once the match started, you could sense United were playing with an intensity which we have seen too rarely this season. While some may credit Carrick or the crowd for that, the truth is we know United can create an impressive tempo when they put their minds to it.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Away at Liverpool under Ruben Amorim, the Reds played with a belief which some teams can only hope for. This attitude resulted in a terrific result at Anfield and United have now picked up a tremendous three points off their nearest rivals City.",
      "But what Carrick managed to do and where Amorim failed with was to make the flanks dangerous for the full 90 minutes. Surprisingly, considering how much Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system relied upon wing-backs, there were many occasions when the Reds looked so poor when they tried to play with width under their previous boss.",
      "Amad was the standout wing-back for the Reds under Amorim, but if we analyse some of the most damning results this season, their approach on the flanks was the key issue. Take the Everton defeat as one example, how many times did United's attacks fizzle out because they were too slow, passive and predictable?",
      "The Wolves draw was more of the same from a United perspective. That is partly what put Amorim's tenure in trouble.",
      "Compare that to the City win. The difference was night and day. Diogo Dalot may have been lucky to be on the pitch in the second half following his challenge on Jeremy Doku in the first 45 minutes, but he made his presence count afterwards.",
      "His link-up play with Amad down the right was impressive as United searched for a goal and after a masterful breakaway for Bryan Mbeumo's first, it was the right side which brought about Patrick Dorgu's strike to make it 2-0, thanks to Matheus Cunha's cross.",
      "On the left, Luke Shaw and Dorgu enjoyed a good connection; with the crowd audibly 'ole-ing' at one slick move which saw Shaw flick the ball through for the Dane. This sort of wing play has been desperately lacking for the Reds this season and Amorim is likely scratching his head from home as to why this team has managed to do something he could not drill into them.",
      "However, such a monumental change down will give United fans confidence that they will be able to put a run of form together to finish in the top four this season. If they do that, Ineos may have to justify why they are not giving Carrick the job permanently this summer.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

Not that players of that era ever did because then they would have missed their rating out of 10 and that wasn’t the done thing, no matter how hard many might insist they didn’t read them.",

At the same time, it seems hugely unlikely that he would not have been aware of the negotiations taking place, and must have expected this would happen eventually, so there’s no real excuse for being caught out by it.",
      "Glasner’s main mistake, however, is not spinning the story his way. His previous comments have suggested he wants about 20 first team-calibre players but wants to pick the same starting XI when everyone is fit. The first of those is the preserve of the biggest clubs, and while it’s a nice ambition to have, there’s a reason clubs the size of Palace tend to fall into the second group.",
      "While his squad on Saturday was, as Harry Redknapp might say, down to the bare bones, it was almost the perfect opportunity to make his case to the board: “I used the players I had available but they’re not ready for the Premier League yet, we need reserves who are”. Instead, he made no substitutions, even with his team 2-1 down with 20 minutes to play, a move that came across as petulance bordering on unprofessionalism.",
      "This is where I have sympathy for the board: by their standards they did spend significant money (approximately £50m) in the summer on fleshing out the squad, something they likely did knowing they’d receive a big fee for Eberechi Eze. For Glasner’s talk of having his heart broken, Palace did make a good start to the season, even without Eze. If the timeline we’ve been told about is correct, then Glasner informed the board he was going to leave at the end of his contract. Despite knowing this, they still broke their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson, a player described as a perfect fit for Glasner’s system, in January. It’s not reasonable to expect a club to spend a fortune every time their manager has a fit of pique, even if there will always be the lingering suspicion that a couple of judicious signings in the summer might have avoided all of this.",
      "Where the board deserve some credit is in (at least as of 3pm on Monday) not being so fragile of ego as to sack Glasner for his insolence. I don’t expect they’re happy about what their manager has said, but it’s definitely the reaction of a grown-up to treat it for what it is, an outburst rooted in frustration and a situation that can be mediated, if not fully repaired. It’s fair to say that plenty of club directors would not have given Glasner this much leeway and you have to wonder if potential employers are having second thoughts about appointing him.",

      "I see it’s been decided that Thomas Frank doesn’t have what it takes to be Spurs manager. He can’t deliver what Spurs fans want. But Spurs fans won’t say what ‘it’ is. What do you want? To be in the top 6 every year? Champions League every year? Title race? Ok, but ahead of who? There are 7 other teams who want all that and can realistically achieve it – which of those should Spurs be displacing? Which of the midtable sides – Everton, Sunderland, Brentford, Brighton, Palace, etc – are Spurs entitled to be ahead of?",
      "The fact bears repeating: Spurs finished *17th* last year. Obviously their fans immediately spring into action when this is pointed out: ‘oh, we won a European trophy!’ Brilliant, let me know how following in West Ham’s footsteps is working out for you. ‘Oh we were concentrating on Europe, we could have finished higher in the league, we just didn’t want to.’ Yeah ok. Maybe you shouldn’t have sacked the manager who masterminded this false rubbishness in that case? And just told him, g’day, we want to finish higher in the league this year mate. Yeah, 1st would be lovely actually mate. Have a VB.",
      "Some of this year’s games have been awful and hard to watch; some of the results have been terrible. Yes. And? Welcome to being a football fan. Everyone has to deal with this. Superclubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, etc feel they’re entitled to skip this part of the experience. Spurs are not these clubs. Their fans think they are long-suffering. They are not.",
      "Look at the defensive players Frank has got to work with: Paulinha has the brain of a dog; Udogie and Porro are complete disgracia; Spence acts like a child on Supernanny. Spurs fans won’t hear anything said against their centre backs, but they are objectively average: Van der Ven can run fast and Romero kicks people and complains a lot, wow. Maybe stop people from scoring occasionally? And Vicario.",
      "But Frank is getting a better tune out of his back 6/7 than anyone since the last time Spurs finished above Arsenal. They’ve conceded over 60 goals for the last 3 seasons in a row; this year they’re on course to concede 50. And aside from Arsenal, they have the best away record in the league – a sign that when they can keep games tight and put the onus on the opposition, they can be successful. It’s not hard to find signs that Frank is actually improving this team, if anyone has the patience to look. Granted, not relative to the imaginary version of Tottenham that their mad fans have in their heads; but relative to the one in the real world that, apart from the worst set of promoted sides since the competition started, was the *worst team* in the premier league last season. Pretend this wasn’t true if it makes you feel better, knock yourself out.",
      "Obviously, Spurs’ problem in translating this quiet improvement into more points and better home form is, constructing coherent attacks and scoring a lot more goals. But how does a new manager fix this? Richarlison is their best attacking player. *Richarlison*. Unless Ryan Mason CDXXVII can give Maddison new legs and find a 20 goal a year striker down the back of the sofa, where do the goals come from? Tel? Simons? I mean, we’re immediately talking the transfer market aren’t we?",
      "Unless the plan is to hire a new manager and tell them, you can’t sign any new players because actually we already have one of the best 4 squads in the country. If so, I have some bad news. But if it is time to sound the warchest klaxon, then it’s implicit that the current squad is not good enough for what is apparently desired. So why fire a workmen you hired less than a year ago when you’re also admitting the tools you have given him are no good?\nNeil Raines",

      "Having last season watched Rasmus Hojlund do a similarly ineffective job up top, I do get the instinct to defend Gyokeres. Having an inept striker can be an especially grating experience – even if the rest of your team is humming and producing cohesive build-up play, you’re never far from a move breaking down via the link in the team that should add that crucial iota of potency.",
      "It’s made all the worse when they show occasional flashes of quality or produce a smart finish. “See? The ability is there, consistency is what’s missing”, we tell ourselves. But when the required quality is lacking, you can’t expect a sub-standard striker to produce those flashes more regularly. Sometimes, your expensive frontman is only able to impact games sporadically because that’s his ceiling.",
      "Rob’s argument for Gyokeres doing fine doesn’t really touch on his ability though – it seems entirely based around Arsenal sitting pretty in mid-January with him in the team. Arteta picks him for the team top of the league, and he’s an actual football manager, so if you think he’s crap, you are clearly wrong sir. But it doesn’t work that way does it? Anyone who’s watched a middling amount of Arsenal this season will tell you that he’s struggled badly.",
      "Isn’t it possible, or even probable, that Arsenal would be in an even stronger position if they’d invested in a striker who was at a level consistent with the rest of their team? 10-15 points clear with no lingering doubts over their goal threat maybe? Gyokeres really doesn’t pass the eye test – poor goal return, minimal contribution, looks laboured and out of sync when he does get involved. The frequent rush to highlight his effort and attitude has been a giveaway to be honest – it’s a classic case of damning with faint praise. Hojlund often got the same sympathetic treatment when charging after a pass down a channel only for it to bounce off his knee out of play.",
      "You can be top of the league, top of the Champions League etc., but still have some weak links Rob. And it’s hard to term Gyokeres as anything other than that up to this point. You’re rightly happy with a season that’s well on track in spite of his struggles. But if it ends with a trophy (or more than one), it might be fairer to laud the strength of the squad around him than trying to say that he must be good just because Arteta made him part of it.\nKeith Reilly",

Apart from one thing: “Secondly, too much change and too many injuries means the team isn’t playing anywhere near its potential – yes yes every team has these, but how many times has changing the manager miraculously fixed everything? ”",
      "My problem with this is the way he has set up the team; it’s just so f**king boring to watch. My belief is it’s the system not the injuries or the bedding in. I’d honestly relinquish a few places in the table in exchange for some excitement. The infinite horseshoe tactic is the worst thing I’ve seen in all the years I’ve watched them play (mid 80s – god I’m old). A new manager coming in may actually release the shackles and let them play with expression and freedom we so desperately lack at the moment. Point taken though, let’s ride the season out.

Quite unprofessional, but ball boys can sometimes be a bit cheeky… However Spain pulled the same trick in the semi-final and got away with it. Noting that match officials seem utterly non-plussed to these anticss and that Pickford needs to stay focused on the game, Dean Henderson comes over to keep the towel safe personally. Unpeturbed by this the ball boys and staff continue to play capture the flag with this towel and then, Spain’s subs start going tying in on the act.",

      "So you can imagine the feeling among the England camp and fans as the ref appears to be acting, let’s say, rather generous to the Spanish team in chalking off an England goal for the softest of not quite fouls expertly preventing VAR intervention, and then giving the Spanish team a soft penalty at the other end moments later?",
      "Could you at this point really feel too shocked and appalled when, let’s say Southgate calls his players off down the tunnel in disgust, eventuality giving in to Harry Kane’s insistence that we have to be professional? Would you still really not be at the point of cheering when Pickford, bullied all match, decides to put off Ferran Torres before the spot kick?",
      "And when somehow England win the match and lift the trophy against all odds and apparently the will of literally everyone else involved in this sham of a match, and as Southgate brings his daughter out to the presser, to be greeted by heckling Spanish reporters, could you truly blame him for adjusting the medal around his neck then walking off and giving two digits to all involved?",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (22 games) – worth around £18.5m",
      "=8th) Chelsea and Liverpool (21 games) – worth around £17.8m",
      "10th) Leeds (19 games) – worth around £16.2m",
      "=11th) Brentford, Crystal Palace, Everton, Fulham and West Ham (17 games) – worth around £14.6m",

      "20th) Burnley (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "",
      "While it will vary due to inflation, fluctuating operating costs and other mitigating factors, it is possible to estimate how much total prize money each Premier League team will be paid in 2025/26 based on the payments made in 2024/25.",
      "1) Arsenal – £71.6m",
      "2) Manchester City – £68.9m",

      "Unai Emery has foolishly been named Premier League Manager of the Month and then conducted a weird interview hinting at issues behind the Aston Villa scenes.",
      "That might not sound like a potent combination for a prompt sacking but in this particular season it is at least an inadvisable path to go down.",
      "Emery has followed an entirely doomed succession line of Premier League Manager of the Month award winners in 2025/26: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot. And the two winners at the end of 2024/25 were Vitor Pereira and Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "In the cases of Maresca, Amorim and the entirely miserable Glasner especially they were crowned against a backdrop of hierarchical and boardroom issues which ultimately helped trigger their departures.",
      "So Emery saying Villa “are not contenders to be in the top five” and venting about “other teams with more potential than us” in a nod to Spurs hijacking their move for Conor Gallagher and Donyell Malen being sold before a replacement was secured, did not sit right with many.",
      "Jamie Redknapp called it “one of the oddest interviews I have ever seen”. Ashley Young thought it was “weird”. Stuart Pearce wondered “whether the frustration going forward will be too much for him that he can’t take this team any further”. Brooklyn Beckham was asked for comment but he’s got a lot going on.",
      "The likelihood of Emery actually leaving this season is infinitesimal; the bloke just wears his heart on his sleeve and was understandably slightly rattled by having to play David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "But in the unlikely event he does leave a post in which he holds an unimaginable amount of power and leeway, Emery would not be the first Premier League Manager of the Month to resign or be sacked in the same season.",
      "He wouldn’t even be the first at Villa Park to be hit by the curse…",

      "Club: Tottenham\nNamed Manager of the Month: November 2020\nPosition when MOTM: 1st\nSacked: April 2021\nPosition when sacked: 7th",
      "The Mourinho boom and bust cycle was in full flow by November 2020 when Spurs beat Brighton, West Brom and Manchester City, rounding the month off with a draw at Chelsea to consolidate their place atop the Premier League a year after his appointment.",
      "That form soon turned and by the time Mourinho was sacked in April, Spurs were barely clinging to a qualification spot for the same Europa League that Dinamo Zagreb dumped them out of despite their coach being in prison at the time.",
      "Spurs tried to hit Mourinho where it hurts, cutting ties six days before the Carabao Cup final and preferring Ryan Mason to lead them out against Manchester City. But they underestimated the Portuguese, who just counts the trophy among his collection anyway.",

      "“Our poor sequence of results stretches back more than three months,” explained West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace, mindful of what came shortly before that.",
      "The newly promoted Baggies felt compelled to act after winning three of 16 Premier League games and slipping into a relegation battle that seemed to be comfortably in the rear-view mirror by September. A home draw with Tottenham, derby spoils in a 3-1 win over Birmingham and a dramatic 3-2 victory at Arsenal, combined with beating Manchester City in the League Cup, had helped dampen the disappointment of a six-goal opening-day thrashing at the hands of Chelsea.",
      "As high as sixth at one stage, West Brom subsequently crashed towards the trap door and only the safety net of Roy Hodgson could rescue them and indeed any of us. But especially and always Crystal Palace.",

      "Few neutral, critics and even fans gave Hull City a tiger’s chance in the ocean of surviving as a Premier League team in their most recent top-flight season. Promotion had been secured through the play-offs but Steve Bruce left less than a month before the campaign began, the first team contained 13 senior players at one point and a protracted takeover looked no closer to being completed.",
      "There seemed to be no hope, although the gallows humour among those who remained was strong.",
      "Against all odds, reigning Premier League champions Leicester were vanquished on the opening day and Swansea fell to Hull too. Manchester United only escaped from the KC Stadium with a win at the end of the month through Marcus Rashford’s stoppage-time strike as Phelan orchestrated an excellent start in his unfamiliar role of being anything other than Manchester United assistant.",
      "But one league win in 18 finally forced Hull into action, perhaps a little too late for Marco Silva to get to know the Premier League. By the time they had lost 6-1 to Bournemouth in October the good Phelan had already long worn off.",

      "September 2001 was particularly flattering as Liverpool, Southampton and Blackburn were swept aside, sandwiching a goalless draw with Sunderland. A Champions League tilt at least looked possible. But from November 3 to New Year’s Day they beat only Ipswich in 11 games and the damage was done when they surrendered a two-goal FA Cup third-round lead over United.",
      "Three days after beating Derby and Charlton in consecutive fixtures, Gregory resigned in quite hilarious circumstances due to fan disgruntlement and issues behind the scenes with chairman Doug Ellis.",

      "Club: Manchester United\nNamed Manager of the Month: October 2025\nPosition when MOTM: 8th\nSacked: January 2026\nPosition when sacked: 6th",
      "In only four of his months as Manchester United manager did Amorim win more than a single Premier League game. And to be fair, the effort it took to muster two victories in December of 2024 and 2025, as well as January 2025, made his only October in charge look generational.",
      "It all seemed to click when Sunderland and Brighton were both sent packing from Old Trafford, sandwiching a ransacking of Anfield in a month which mercifully included no participation in the cups and thus no opportunity for Manchester United to embarrass themselves.",
      "That was probably the peak of the entire experiment. Amorim won just three of his next 11 games, but most pertinently challenged the authority of the great Jason Wilcox, to fall on his sword within a couple of months.",

      "Never a particularly natural fit in north London as a mid-table manager promoted beyond his station, Nuno started with three straight 1-0 wins over Manchester City, Wolves and Watford while navigating a Harry Kane transfer saga to send Spurs top.",

      "“We’ve got stars directing our fate, and we’re praying it’s not too late, ’cause we know we’re falling from grace” would have been a fitting way to say goodbye to the millennium’s first Premier League Manager of the Month.",
      "A draw with Arsenal and victories over Bradford and Tottenham offered a glimmer of survival hope at Hillsborough in January. What a month, huh? But of course, captain, it’s Wednesday – they won one of their next seven before Wilson was sacked and Peter Shreeves came in to steer the ship into the First Division.",
      "Wilson never managed in the Premier League again. It didn’t look particularly promising when David Blunkett led four Sheffield MPs in demanding Wednesday take action in mid-January as “this sort of situation would probably have been addressed back in November at most other Premiership clubs”.",

      "Club: Reading\nNamed Manager of the Month: January 2013\nPosition when MOTM: 17th\nSacked: March 2013\nPosition when sacked: 19th",
      "What was the quickest case of the curse striking came in 2013, when McDermott started February as Premier League Manager of the Month and barely made it to mid-March before being rendered unemployed.",
      "Reading went on two separate runs of seven consecutive league defeats that season but January brought brief and beautiful respite with wins over West Brom and Newcastle, as well as a comeback draw with European champions Chelsea. Three more points against Sunderland on February 2 were the last McDermott would collect in his first stint as manager at the Madejski, with defeats to Stoke, Wigan, Everton and Aston Villa plunging them back into the sort of danger even the Nigel Adkins diet could not salvage.",
      "A similar fate befell Adam Le Fondre. The striker was named Player of the Month for January in a Royal double after scoring five times in four games, yet he had to wait until May for his next goal. Le Fondre still set the benchmark that season.",

      "He probably experienced even tougher times in the intervening period, winning only two of his final nine matches and having to deal with more medical professionals telling him Reece James and Cole Palmer will spontaneously combust if he keeps picking them.",

      "Diogo Dalot drew headlines on Saturday after avoiding a red card for a studs-up challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby. It was more attention than he’s received for anything he’s done at Manchester United for a long time. That’s meant more as a compliment than an insult.",
      "He’s rarely bad enough to draw criticism. He’s normally fine and being fine for Manchester United has been no mean feat in what has incredibly been his seven-and-a-half years at the football club. Only Luke Shaw (11-and-a-half years) has been at Old Trafford longer; Dalot is the 23rd longest-serving Premier League player.",
      "Signed under Jose Mourinho in 2018, he’s seen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ruben Amorim come and go; he’s currently enjoying his second helping of Michael Carrick, who – like his predecessors – will presumably find Dalot to be a consummate professional and a safe pair of boots.",
      "There’s a lot to be said for those consistent 6/10 players, particularly when the performances of the long, long list of Dalot’s United teammates past and present have been so variable. But there is also always the possibility that the grass may be greener, quite a lot greener as an alternative view is that his 232 appearances for the club symbolises the Red Devils’ post-Sir Alex Ferguson inadequacy.",
      "His apologists will claim he doesn’t get the credit he deserves, and that may be fair, but we’re also struggling to imagine too many Premier League managers chasing Dalot over the full-backs they currently have available to them. We doubt, for example, that Andoni Iraola would trade Dalot for Alex Jimenez.",
      "The 20-year-old joined Bournemouth from AC Milan on loan in the summer, but is now just four starts from meeting the 18-game requirement for that loan to be turned into a permanent £16m transfer at the end of the season.",
      "In 52 senior games for Milan and Bournemouth he’s yet to score a goal and has just three assists to his name, but as shown frequently in this clash with Brighton, he’s very adept at getting his team up the pitch with what is his outstanding speed and jinking acceleration with the ball at his feet. And while that final bit – the cross or shot – is currently lacking, his technical quality suggests those goal contributions will come in time.",
      "It was his bursting midfield run and crucial pass which set up Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser to make it 4-4 against Manchester United in December, and him playing on the right wing as he did on that day at Old Trafford, suggests Iraola – who it’s fair to say knows his onions – has no doubts over the right-back’s creativity.",
      "Nor will there be concern over his defensive faculties. Kauro Mitoma barely had sniff on the left for Brighton, though was forced to enjoy Jimenez screaming in his face after one instance of many in which the Bournemouth man got the better of him.",
      "Anyone watching him of late will be of a view that Jimenez is a star that’s yet to make the headlines that Dalot has avoided through his mediocrity.",
      "United managed to persuade both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to join them over rivals in the summer, but in this saga of Red Devils transition, for every Champions League-ready star they are able to sign there will be another – like Antoine Semenyo – who opts to move to a better, more stable football club.",
      "As Ruben Amorim found out when he was denied the Semenyo money to spend on an alternative, United aren’t about to throw cash around willy-nilly as they once did, particularly when – as is the case with Dalot – the need for improvement isn’t all that conspicuous.",
      "But there is room for improvement and the best means for United to make gains would be for them to target unheralded players with high ceilings who may only marginally improve the first team when they arrive, but have the potential to make a huge difference in the not-too-distant future. Alex Jimenez is one of those players."

      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender gave a measured response – which he was asked for – to the pundit’s baseless criticism ahead of the Manchester derby. Excuse us for getting into a playground back and forth dear readers, but how about you f***ing grow up, mate.",
      "Rather than being “picked up and run with like a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler” by Erling Haaland, as Butt suggested would be the case, Martinez was the teacher waiting at the school gates to reprimand the father for his tardiness.",
      "It was a magnificent display from the Red Devils centre-back against the Premier League’s most dangerous striker; one Butt and fellow bullsh*t purveyor Paul Scholes might have predicted had their analysis of the battle involved more than a quick glance at their relative physiques.",
      "Saturday was Martinez’s fourth win in five meetings against Haaland and his second clean sheet. If there’s a criticism that can be aimed at the Argentinian it’s that there’s a rick in him. No-one is saying he’s a perfect centre-back; he makes mistakes too frequently to be hailed as a world class defender.",
      "But it’s very difficult to watch Martinez play a game of football and question his aggression, pace or physicality. Scholes’ suggestion that Haaland would “score, then throw him in the net” was also apropos of nothing. It was nonsense. Fiction for clicks.",
      "“He can say whatever he wants,” Martinez said. “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.”",
      "Scholes accepted that invitation but, perhaps frustrated or embarrassed at being The Other Guy On The Podcast not even worthy of reference by the United star, Butt issued a nuclear and unbefitting response.",
      "“We are a podcast, we are three lads in a pub, we are not on Sky doing commentary. It’s quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious that.",
      "“When someone gets so upset about someone in the media or a podcast to start saying they can do what they want and come to my house and all that, f***ing grow up.",
      "“If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying that about you, you shouldn’t be at a big club. He will get that at the rest of his career at United, there will be ups and downs.",
      "“There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. I think it’s really sad that someone gets so upset.”",
      "We’re reticent to draw attention to it as there’s evidently nothing that Butt – at the start of his punditry career – wants more than for this to be dubbed a ‘war of words’. Martinez “doesn’t care” what Scholes thinks; he’s not about to give a sh*t about the thoughts of the guy alongside him. What is he? The podcast producer?",
      "But we were triggered by the obvious need for the man telling another man to grow up to grow up himself. There isn’t a person on earth who took Butt’s claim that Haaland would pick Martinez and run with him literally. It is indeed “f***ing obvious” and definitely not the reason Martinez was irritated, Nicky.",
      "Martinez, like every human being over the age of six knows how metaphors work. He’s annoyed by a) what the metaphor suggests and b) that suggestion being without foundation.",
      "And what’s this rubbish about “emotional” footballers not being suited to “big clubs”. Wasn’t Roy Keane your captain? Didn’t you watch Eric Cantona kung-fu kick a fan? You can’t just tell someone to grow up and expect to win the argument. He’ll be telling him to stop showing off in front of his friends in a minute.",
      "Butt and Scholes also can’t just brush off whatever they say on the basis of this being a podcast akin to “three lads (we would actively avoid) in a pub”. Well actually, they can, but a licence to say anything at all with no regard to facts, stats or simply what people see with their eyes makes it an entirely meaningless pursuit and one we can only hope that Martinez and the rest of the Manchester United players continue to treat with the disdain it deserves.",

      "If you look back on Manchester derby games since Fergie left United have done pretty well when considering the gulf between the two over that time. United have 12 wins to City’s 14 with 5 draws. So beating City isn’t unusual. You would also recognise some of the tactics employed by Carrick in previous wins against City. Low block, low possession, and a counter attacking threat were all on display.",
      "However, many of those previous United wins were either on a knife edge or involved healthy doses of fortune. Not since well before Fergie left have a United side so utterly dominated a derby game. Both in and out of possession United dictated the pace and overwhelmed City with a relentless energy.",
      "Carrick was smart, which is a good sign, because he addressed the obvious thing first. United’s main defensive issue under Amorim was too much space in the midfield. So he made the team narrow, closed the space in between the lines, and put more men in the middle. Simple right.",
      "In particular playing Dorgu as a defensive winger who tucked into midfield really helped. It gave Mainoo the cover he needed to follow Foden/Cherki as they roamed and meant Amad and Bruno could jump out to press with Mbeumo when the opportunity arose.",
      "Going forward it wasn’t a case of playing it long and chasing through balls. United played out from the back and held possession in their own third with relative ease, then a straight pass through the middle, usually by Martinez or a very good Casemiro, triggered quick and aggressive attacks.",
      "There was a moment too when Mainoo received the ball then quickly turned the pressing Semenyo and passed out wide to start an attack. It was lovely and exactly the type of thing he needs to more of. He played well and looks so much more comfortable with midfield support though was outshone by many other excellent performances on the day. If he can do that press beating turn 3-4 times a game then he’ll quickly become the pivotal cog in our midfield.",
      "City though were just bad. The derby probably came at a good time for United given the current form of Pep’s team and apparent defensive line issues. There was period toward the end of the first half where Pep altered the positions slightly and City had us pinned to our box, they were knocking it around it that familiar way when they unpick a low block but the threat never came. They just didn’t shoot. Feels a bit like that period last season when they looked lost, almost like Pep trying to make them more direct has neglected the identity that made them so dominant.",
      "Looking forward on Carrick’s United it would be silly to take too much from this performance. Getting up for big games against rivals hasn’t been United’s problem. The comments from Shearer of ‘this performance level has to be the standard now’ just isn’t realistic and exactly what he said after the Liverpool win earlier this season. Derby games are unique because teams often find a higher than normal level. United do need more energy and urgency in general but expecting that performance every week is foolish.",
      "Tactically too Carrick can’t really do that to other teams. They will have to win whilst dominating possession and by unlocking the kind of low block he deployed on Saturday. United have been fairly proficient in attack this season, Carrick needs to find a way to maintain that threat whilst keeping control and remaining resolute in defence. That isn’t simple.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "…What a performance in the derby, probably our best in years, and I was delighted enough to watch the match back in full and highlights on MoTD. The team looked well organised, dangerous in attack, and the energy and desire to press, defend and close down space was tremendous.",
      "Nobody can question that we have the makings of a good squad and, therefore, there is some talent there; although here comes the b-bomb. But, these players have shown before that they can raise their game in the bigger matches, reflected in our healthy number of points gained against the top half of the table this season. Our issue has been the low-block teams when we have more of the ball – can we break those teams down and, more importantly, show the same hunger and desire to work hard off the ball to defend well as a team? Time will tell, so let’s keep our powder dry for now. (Making up 15 points at this stage is doable, yeah? Beat Arsenal and it’s only 12! Shh, they’ll say you’re crazy).",
      "In other news, I do hope those Liverpool fans calling for Slot’s head (did he not win the league last season or was that actually a bad dream) and hoping Alonso will come in know what they are letting themselves in for. They need to appreciate that his most successful system thus far has been using 3 at the back at Leverkusen, and arguably it was a shift from this system and style to placate the Madridistas that led to his demise there.",
      "Assuming that’s acceptable then brace yourselves, as you’re in for a treat. As soon as results start going south, which they will if even temporarily to restructure the squad, it is all you will hear about from the media, ex-players and impatient fellow fans.

      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",

      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",

      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Paul Scholes and former Man Utd team-mate Nicky Butt mocked Lisandro Martinez's size compared to Man City's Erling Haaland ahead of the derby but the United defender called for criticism to be delivered face-to-face after keeping the City striker out in 2-0 win at Old Trafford",
      "Sunday 18 January 2026 14:38, UK",
      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Martinez said things at United were \"so different\" in the build-up to the win against City, with Michael Carrick taking charge of the team until the end of the season, following Darren Fletcher's brief interim spell in the hotseat after Ruben Amorim's exit.",
      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",
      "\"But if sometimes our performance wasn't the best because they expect from us good attitude, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United.",
      "\"And I can really understand because sometimes it's like 'what are we doing here?' And today, that is the standard for this club.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "\"Let's judge it over the next few months. The key for him is trying to get momentum in the team. He is an English coach, the English media will be pushing for him. He has done well today, but let's see how he does.",
      "\"They've won one game! The last manager won one game. He's only been there three days.",
      "\"Darren Fletcher changed the formation, but there were players missing. Michael Carrick has come in to the dream scenario. Everyone is available, City at home, they've been a little bit off it, he could have had a man sent off.",
      "\"Timing and a bit of luck, they have made the most of it. Take nothing away from him - but everyone just calm down.\"",

      "Nicky Butt on Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez's reaction to criticism ahead of the Manchester derby: \"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house'... grow up\"",
      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 01:14, UK",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have continued their war of words with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez, with Butt telling the Argentine to \"grow up\" over his response to criticism.",
      "After playing his part in United's 2-0 win over City at Old Trafford, Martinez challenged Scholes to speak to him face-to-face after he and Nicky Butt had mocked the defender's size before his battle with Erling Haaland, suggesting the Norwegian would \"pick him up and run with him\".",
      "Scholes said he had previously exchanged messages with Martinez on social media and given the player his phone number but had \"not heard anything\".",
      "But responding directly to Martinez's comments on the latest edition of his The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Scholes' joint-host and former team-mate Butt said: \"It's tongue-in-cheek, it's obvious Haaland isn't actually going to pick him up and run with him, it's a figure of speech,\" he said.",
      "\"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house', f****** grow up.",
      "\"Literally, if you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a big football club because you'll get that for the rest of your career at Man United.",
      "\"I got so much crap when I played at United and Newcastle, but the next week you get plaudits and clapped at. There's no personal issue with us and Martinez, none.\"",
      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in dire need of a rest. Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",

      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",

Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",
