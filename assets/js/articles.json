      "David Beckham's former teammate would love to see him own Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown admits it would be a dream come true to see Sir David Beckham become the new owner of his old club. Beckham left Old Trafford back in 2003 to join Real Madrid for a £25million fee after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "But since hanging up his boots, Beckham has become involved in the world of football club ownership. The 50-year-old is currently a team owner of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer and, more recently, became a leading member of a consortium that owns Salford City.",
      "United's major shareholders, the Glazer family, have proven deeply unpopular in their time with the club, and speculation over a sale has been rife in recent years. Such uncertainty saw Sir Jim Ratcliffe arrive as a co-owner in 2024 after buying a 27 per cent share for £1.25bn.",
      "Ratcliffe's tenure has seen him become a face of the club's ownership, and he has proven controversial too. United have imposed a number of cost-cutting measures, including widespread redundancies, and in some corners, an appetite for a takeover remains.",
      "Although Brown does not believe a bid from Beckham is imminent, he admits it would be a dream move. Speaking to BettingLounge, he said: \"Could Becks come back to United as owner one day? Becks has done fantastic at Inter Miami.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"He's brought in some great players. They are building the team again now to go bigger and bigger to become this worldwide brand. He’s done brilliantly in that sense.",
      "\"Manchester United is a little bit different. Inter Miami are a new team that needs to get itself out there to the world. I don’t think anybody thinks United need to get themselves out there!",
      "\"But Becks back at United? It would be a dream come true if that was ever the case but I think Sir David is busy enough at the moment.\"",
      "David and Victoria Beckham at an Inter Miami match(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Beckham's ownership group behind Inter Miami formed in 2013 as Miami Beckham United. The ex-AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain loanee agreed a deal when he joined LA Galaxy that allowed him to own an expansion team for a discounted franchise fee.",
      "Speaking in 2023, when United were actively in search of new owners, Beckham explained what he wanted to see happen at that level. He said: \"Whoever is running your club, you want them to be passionate, be involved, make the right decisions, bring in the right players and invest in the club.",
      "\"Because the club does need investment, whether it’s the training facility, stadium, on the field…these kinds of big things need to be made and changes do need to happen, especially when you see the likes of Man City and what they’re doing.\"",

      "Jack Moorhouse is back in Manchester after a loan stint away and has been training with the first-team",
      "Manchester United had five of their youngsters - including striker JJ Gabriel - involved in training ahead of their clash with Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The club have been going through their paces ahead of the lunchtime clash as they bid to make it four wins from four under Michael Carrick. Jack Moorhouse was one of several youngsters involved in training on Wednesday. He has recently returned from a loan spell at Leyton Orient and is looking to press on after recently heading back to Manchester.",
      "He has been part of four matchdays squad in the past - the first of those coming against Tottenham last year. He was also an unused substitute for the two Europa League ties with Lyon and a home draw with Arsenal.",
      "Jack and Tyler Fletcher were also spotted as United trained in front of the MUTV cameras. They are the sons of ex-player Darren, who remains in the club's set-up and was the caretaker boss of the side for two games before Carrick's appointment until the end of the season.",
      "Full-back Yuel Helafu, 17, was also testing himself against the senior pros and he remained with the main group when his fellow youngsters moved into a separate part of the session later in the day.",
      "Forward Gabriel, 15, was also among the first-team during training. He is ineligible to play in Premier League games, but he is highly rated at the club and has scored 11 goals in 16 games for the academy this season with many tipping him for big things.",
      "Carrick in the building is now seen as a huge plus for the next generation of players. The ex-midfielder's son plays for the U16s and the parents of those in the set-up believe he will have a greater understanding of the club's traditions of backing youth.",
      "JJ Gabriel has been starring for Manchester United's academy(Image: Poppy Townson - MUFC/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Previously Ruben Amorim had made little use of the club's young players with his attitude towards Kobbie Mainoo often making headlines. He claimed: “We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that’s that’s the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.”",
      "A source told The Sun recently: “Carrick has been a regular at the training ground following the progress of his son. He is a lovely welcoming guy who always has time for everyone. People respect him and admire him because of his United career, but they also feel like he gets what it means to have a son in the academy. Parents were appalled by Amorim’s comments. Anyone in professional football should know how hard it is to make a career in football at any level, let alone at United.”",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has received a message from Alex Iwobi following an incident between the pair during Manchester United's Premier League triumph over Fulham. Both players started Sunday's match, with Benjamin Sesko netting a decisive late goal for Michael Carrick's side.",
      "Strikes from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had given United the advantage, but a Raul Jimenez spot-kick and Kevin's spectacular effort levelled things for the visitors with mere minutes remaining. However, second-half replacement Sesko secured the victory with a superb finish.",
      "Those three points allowed Carrick to preserve his perfect winning record. It follows impressive victories over Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "The returns of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo from the Africa Cup of Nations have been pivotal to these results. The turnaround has also coincided with Harry Maguire's return to full fitness.",
      "Mainoo's reintegration into the starting eleven has equally proved transformative. Bruno Fernandes has subsequently shifted into his preferred attacking midfield position.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Playing alongside Casemiro, the 20-year-old has been demonstrating his calibre in recent weeks. Iwobi is still experiencing the aftermath of his influence from Sunday's encounter.",
      "In his latest YouTube video, he playfully remarked: \"Shout out Kobbie Mainoo, but Kobbie man... you absolutely finished my hand. This guy has Ghanaian strength!\"",
      "Alex Iwobi has given Kobbie Mainno a shout out on social media(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "Whilst speaking, Iwobi raised the two smallest fingers on his right hand to reveal them bandaged together. It remains unclear precisely what Mainoo did to Iwobi that caused his finger injury, but, based on the latter's remarks, it appears to have occurred during a tussle for the ball, in which the United player came out on top.",
      "A month ago, a January loan move appeared probable for Mainoo, with Amorim having given him barely 200 minutes of Premier League action this season. Since the former United head coach revealed he was in direct competition with Fernandes for a place in the team, his appearances became increasingly rare.",
      "Napoli had been expressing keen interest in securing his services temporarily, with the Italian champions already having Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund on their books. Currently, a contract extension appears far more probable than an exit this summer, with discussions set to commence.",
      "The midfielder has 18 months left on his existing agreement, and should Carrick stay in post, he will undoubtedly push to finalise a deal. The 44-year-old discussed Mainoo during a recent press briefing, noting the midfield partnership he is cultivating with Casemiro.",
      "Carrick said: \"Sometimes we can pigeonhole players quite quickly, but it's not always the case. Kobbie can play different roles within that, but definitely with Cassie in the middle, the last couple of games they've had a really good pairing and been a big part of controlling the team.\"",

      "Harry Kane is enjoying a sensational season with Bayern Munich(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Teddy Sheringham believes that Benjamin Sesko is not the answer for Manchester United and has urged his former club to sign Harry Kane. The Red Devils, when Ruben Amorim was still in charge, splashed £74m to sign him from RB Leipzig last summer.",
      "But the Slovenian has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford with just five Premier League goals in 19 appearances, albeit his most recent strike secured victory against Fulham last time.",
      "Former United star Sheringham has suggested that while Sesko continues to develop, the club should consider signing an experienced frontman such as Bayern Munich and England forward Kane.",
      "Speaking to MrQ, Sheringham said: “I’ve quite liked Benjamin Sesko recently. I thought he played very well against Leeds in particular, linking up the play. He’s scored a couple of goals recently too, but he’s a young lad still learning his game.",
      "“There is a big difference between a young lad enjoying his game for an average Premier League team and then going in at Manchester United and being expected to lead the line for a top club and challenging for honours.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“He’s still finding his game, and I believe he will become a good player. But someone who is still learning like Sesko is, it’s not what Manchester United need. They need the finished article in there.",
      "“There’s still a long time between now and the end of the season, so Sesko will get his chances again. I know Michael Carrick has not been starting him, but just by watching and being around the football club, he will learn about what it takes to be a centre-forward for Manchester United.",
      "“I think Sesko is a talented boy, and I think he’s clearly got something about him, but as ever, Manchester United need results now. They need to bring in a proven goalscorer this summer. For me, they should do something that they should have done years ago and bring in Harry Kane.",

      "“They should have gone for Harry Kane three years ago, but they didn’t. They went down the slightly less expensive route in Rasmus Hojlund, and now Benjamin Sesko. You can see what you end up with when you go down that route. You end up with someone who is just an okay player, rather than a top player leading the line.”",

The England international had to be patient before getting the opportunity to play at Barca's legendary Camp Nou stadium following delays to their redevelopment project but the best may still lie ahead - including a potential European final at the storied venue.",

He could yet grace the venue on the grandest stage of all, though, with Barcelona confirming their ambition to host the 2029 Champions League final.",

      "Tuesday night was a tense one for Barcelona and Marcus Rashford but they managed to secure the result they were after in the Copa del Rey. Second-division side Albacete, who had previously shocked Real Madrid, put up a strong fight in their quarter-final clash but couldn't stop Barca clinching a 2-1 victory.",
      "Goals from Lamine Yamal and Ronald Araujo either side of half-time gave Barcelona the upper hand, while Javi Moreno's late strike for the hosts wasn't enough to turn the tide. Hansi Flick's team remain on track to win the competition for the second year running, following their extra-time triumph over Real Madrid in last season's final.",
      "Rashford set up the second goal on the night and Barcelona will have the option to make his move permanent for £26million when his loan spell from Manchester United ends this summer. Despite changes at his parent club, with former on-field colleague Michael Carrick now serving as interim manager, Rashford has shown no desire to return.",
      "Rashford, making his first start in six matches, didn't add to the 10 goals he has scored this season, though he still caught the eye with his performance. Here's what the Spanish press had to say about his display on Tuesday night.",
      "FOLLOW OUR BARCELONA FB PAGE! Latest news and more from Camp Nou on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Spanish publication Sport awarded both scorers, Yamal and Araujo, eight out of 10 in their player ratings. However, Rashford was among several players who received a six - while some scored even lower.",
      "\"He alternated between some good plays, very characteristic of English football, especially his dribbling, and others that were surprising for a player of his calibre, such as a wayward shot early in the game,\" their write-up read. \"Where he truly excels, however, is with set pieces. He delivered a pinpoint cross to Araujo's head. Another assist in his tally.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo offered one-word player summaries, accompanied by more detailed assessments of their performances. For Rashford, that single word was 'Grown', with a reference to manager Flick's advice earlier in the week.",
      "Ronald Araujo scored Barcelona's second goal after a Rashford corner(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Flick asked him for more the day before: message received,\" they wrote. \"Even considering his mistakes, which he did have, his best quality was his constant desire to make a difference.",
      "\"He missed a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but in return, he was involved in the play that led to the 1-0 goal, delivered the cross that made it 2-0, and, after a run into the box, set up Olmo for a goal, although it didn't end up being a goal.\"",
      "Marca's match report highlighted Rashford's contribution to Yamal's goal. The loanee may have assisted Araujo's second but he also played a crucial role in the opener, demonstrating how good a fit he is for Barcelona's clinical football.",
      "\"Lorenzo Aguado lost possession under pressure from De Jong, who passed to Rashford,\" the report read. \"Rashford returned the ball to the Dutchman, who then played it out to Lamine.",
      "\"The number 10 didn't miss, firing his trademark high, angled shot across goal and into the far corner. You can't afford to make mistakes against a team like Barca.\"",
      "Finally, AS also highlighted Flick's pre-match guidance to Rashford. However, their assessment of the England international was far less complimentary.",
      "\"[Marc] Bernal... more than fulfilled expectations, while Rashford failed to take the step forward his coach had demanded beforehand,\" they reported. \"He missed a one-on-one chance against Lizoain in a glaring fashion after just seven minutes.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "He has only run four times for his connections since arriving at trainer Dan Skelton’s yard from France and last season after winning first time out at Wetherby, he finished second in a Grade 1 race at the Grand National meeting.",

      "“He'll stay hurdling next season and then go chasing the year after. He'll be a very exciting novice chaser, but next season we'll be picking our targets. It's not easy for them, but he's good.”",
      "This term he was well beaten at Ascot before running third in a valuable handicap hurdle at Windsor last month, a performance that bookmakers took note of.",
      "Live Conti: ruled out of the Cheltenham Festival",
      "He was heading the betting for the County Hurdle ahead of 10-1 chance Murcia, the horse who beat him at Aintree in April, until Skelton announced Live Conti would not line up at Cheltenham on Wednesday.",
      "“Unfortunately Live Conti has tendon strain and will not make Cheltenham,” he wrote on X. “He’ll be back in training next winter.”",

After last month's 1-1 stalemate with Leeds United, United opted to suddenly dismiss Amorim, with Carrick later taking caretaker charge.",

United's temporary boss will undoubtedly value this gesture as he strives to guide the club back into the Champions League and put his name in the hat for the permanent job.",
      "During his final press conference, Amorim delivered quite the tirade with numerous former United managers receiving mentions.

Ronaldo, who turns 41 on Thursday, refused to play for Al-Nassr in their 1-0 victory over Al-Riyadh on Monday after being left furious by Karim Benzema's move to title rivals Al-Hilal.",
      "Benzema, who Ronaldo played alongside for Real Madrid, had his contract with Al-Ittihad terminated before completing a free transfer to Al-Hilal, who are one point above Al-Nassr at the top of the Saudi Pro League. However, all three clubs are owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Ronaldo is angry that the deal was sanctioned, believing that Al-Hilal's title hopes have been wrongly boosted by signing the French striker.",
      "The situation has sparked speculation over whether Ronaldo will see out the final 18 months of his £488,000-a-day contract with Al-Nassr. So could the five-time Ballon d'Or winner return for a stunning third spell with Manchester United?",
      "No, according to his ex-team-mate, Wes Brown. Former United defender Brown told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no.",

      "\"I can't see how that could happen. A move to MLS? Maybe. Maybe he goes back to Portugal and plays there. I'm sure he will still have so many options.",

It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",

Whites manager Marco Silva criticised what he believed was an extraordinary VAR ruling to grant United a free-kick that led to their first goal during his team's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Referee John Brooks originally pointed to the penalty spot after Matheus Cunha went to ground following Jorge Cuenca's challenge. Replays revealed Cuenca had won the ball cleanly, but rather than completely reversing the decision, VAR suggested United should receive a free-kick on the touchline.",
      "The reason was that Brooks had awarded the penalty for a tug that occurred outside the area. Casemiro nodded home from the subsequent free-kick to break the deadlock.",
      "Silva believed the video assistant had effectively re-officiated the match, but Gallagher said: \"Straight away, I knew it wasn't a penalty.",

      "“It’s the first time this season that a penalty has been given for one incident and then a VAR decision comes from a completely different incident and gave a free-kick. It’s the first time we have seen that this season, last season, but maybe it comes more in the future.”",

      "Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes commented: \"It seems the end of the road is nearing for Ronaldo's Saudi adventure. The betting suggests a switch to the MLS is on the cards, but we are seeing interesting money on the Portuguese icon hanging up his boots.\"",
      "Other options include a move from Al-Nassr to another league rival at 7/4, but the odds suggest a slim chance of Ronaldo retiring at 3/1. However, with just over 50 goals left to reach 1000 career goals, it seems unlikely that CR7 will bid farewell to the game anytime soon.",

      "Brandon Williams has left Hull City(Image: Shaun Brooks - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United hopeful Brandon Williams has agreed to cut ties with Hull City. The Tigers confirmed the decision in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "The 25-year-old made just one appearance after joining the club in the summer. Williams secured his move after going on trial with the side, ending a 12-month period as a free agent following his departure from Old Trafford.",
      "The defender had signed a one-year contract, with an option for a second, but that has now been terminated. Williams was included in just six matchday squads and struggled with fitness before Hull agreed to end his stay to facilitate an easier exit, according to Hull Live.",
      "The club stated: \"Hull City can confirm that full-back Brandon Williams has left the club by mutual agreement.",
      "\"The 25-year-old's only first-team appearance after joining the Tigers last August came as a substitute in the Sky Bet Championship home defeat to Blackburn Rovers later that month.",
      "\"We would like to thank Brandon for his efforts during his time at the MKM Stadium and wish him all the best for his future career.\"",
      "Williams has had a challenging time in football and was given a suspended prison sentence last May following a serious driving offence. He received a three-year driving ban after being involved in a high-speed crash.",
      "The former United academy graduate made 51 appearances for the club, with all bar one coming under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's management. Back in 2019, the Norwegian boss hailed Williams as being 'as brave as a lion' after an impressive man-of-the-match display against Partizan Belgrade.",
      "\"Brandon has an absolutely great attitude,\" he added. \"The boy is going to be a top, top player.\"",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a fan of Brandon Williams(Image: 2019 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"He's never let us down,\" Solskjaer remarked at another press conference. \"He's a top young kid, he's got great attitude and confidence.",
      "\"He's got everything a Man United kid should have. You're never scared of putting Brandon in any type of game.\"",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson also singled him out for praise the same year following his first-team breakthrough.",
      "Williams struggled to progress under Erik ten Hag and was loaned out to Norwich and Ipswich during his Old Trafford tenure. Solskjaer seemed to maintain belief in his former protégé, though, and was reportedly considering bringing Williams to Besiktas during his stint there.",
      "The defender was determined to revive his career after joining Hull, but must now reassess his options. Williams stressed he was prepared to make amends for past errors when he penned his deal with the Championship outfit.",
      "He said: \"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now. I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more.",
      "Williams, 25, is now a free agent(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "\"I'm becoming one of the senior players in the squad as well, so it's important for me to help the young players as well because I know how difficult it is. It was difficult because everyone kind of forgot what I actually achieved; people don't understand that.",
      "\"I didn't even understand at the time what I've actually achieved (playing for Manchester United at such a young age). There are a lot of people in the world who would wish that for their child or something like that. It was upsetting that I've let a lot of people down; it's for me to get things right now.",
      "\"Like, I've always said as well, I don't want any sympathy from anyone. It was my actions; I took responsibility for them. I've apologised, and all I can do now is just focus on my football and get things right on the pitch, and I'm sure that people will appreciate that.\"",

      "United players had Monday off before Tuesday was used as a recovery day for the players who started the 3-2 win over Fulham. Gabriel cannot play in the Premier League as he is 15, meaning his professional debut will have to wait until the start of next season.",

      "\"He works hard. First thing I'd say is he loves football. He loves training, he loves playing, he loves having the ball, he loves expressing himself. He makes fantastic decisions.",
      "\"He's got an enthusiasm for the game that's just amazing. 15-year-old, a bright future ahead of him. I'm super excited by his talent, but the most important thing is that he keeps developing, and he's in the U18s team, and he's doing fantastically well, but he's still got lots to learn.",

      "\"But I couldn't speak highly enough of JJ. He's got an amazing family and amazing support around him and he's somebody we're delighted to have at the club.",
      "\"And we just hope he keeps improving, learning every day and just keep being the boy that he is really and enjoying love and playing football and going and expressing themselves and scoring lots of goals so the Manchester United under 18s win every game. And then I'll be a happy man.\"",

      "Manchester United have been presented with an intriguing transfer opportunity(Image: Getty Images)",
      "A huge and unexpected transfer opportunity has emerged for Manchester United following a dramatic end to the January transfer window. Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta watched his deadline day switch to AC Milan fall apart at the final hurdle after he failed a medical, reportedly because of a knee problem he'd been nursing.",
      "Consequently, Mateta had no option but to return to Selhurst Park - although his position there has since grown increasingly uncertain. Palace had already secured a replacement, finalising a £48million move for Wolves attacker Jorgen Strand Larsen late on Monday, leaving Mateta's long-term role at the club in doubt.",
      "This dramatic twist could create an opening for United, who have long been linked with the 28-year-old. With Palace now well supplied in forward areas, a potential summer switch to Old Trafford could suddenly become realistic - particularly in light of United's recent penchant for Premier League-proven players - including Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both of whom have made promising starts since joining the club in Manchester last year.",
      "Mateta's deal in south London is set to expire in 2027 and, with talks over a new contract seemingly stalling, the Red Devils could look to secure his services at a cut price, especially if Palace are keen to avoid losing him on a free in just 17 months.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Even so, breaking into United's starting line-up would be far from straightforward. The club splashed over £200m on attacking reinforcements last summer, including the arrival of Benjamin Sesko as their new marquee No. 9.",
      "The Slovenia international has largely struggled to justify his £73m fee, but three goals across his last three outings suggest he may finally be hitting his stride. Should that upturn continue, Mateta could find opportunities limited - similar to the situation faced by Joshua Zirkzee, United's current second-choice centre-forward, over the past couple of seasons.",
      "Mateta was notably absent from Palace's 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, with head coach Oliver Glasner revealing the striker was \"not at his best\" amid the uncertainty surrounding his future. It marked just the second Premier League fixture he has missed for the club since November 2023.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is stuck between a rock and a hard place after his move to AC Milan fell through(Image: PA)",
      "Not only is Mateta Palace’s leading scorer this term, having netted 10 times in 34 appearances, he has also topped their scoring charts in each of the last three seasons. That leaves Glasner facing a tough decision to make over who should spearhead the attack for the rest of the season - a decision United will undoubtedly be monitoring with interest.",
      "After already pouring significant resources into strengthening their defence last season and revamping their forward line this year, United are widely expected to shift their focus toward midfield upgrades in the upcoming window.",
      "Mateta's Crystal Palace team-mate Adam Wharton is one of several midfielders linked with a summer move to Old Trafford, alongside Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "This area is likely to command the bulk of United's transfer attention, but should the chance arise to secure a proven Premier League striker at a knock-down price, they may find it difficult to resist.",

      "Another Premier League star could be poised to take after Scott McTominay by ditching his international allegiances(Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United star Scott McTominay could provide the blueprint for Harvey Barnes to follow him to Scotland. McTominay made his decision after receiving some wise counsel from Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho, who both advised him to snub England.",
      "The Telegraph revealed Scotland boss Steve Clarke and the Scottish FA are working hard to tempt Barnes north of the border. The Newcastle winger is eligible to represent Scotland through his grandparents and is free to change his international allegiance, having earned just one Three Lions cap back in October 2020.",
      "It's believed Scotland are keen to have Barnes on board ahead of the World Cup 2026 later this summer. And if McTominay serves as any indication of how things might pan out at Hampden Park, the switch could prove worthwhile for his career.",
      "Barnes, 28, has netted 12 goals in 36 outings across all competitions this season but still remains ignored by Thomas Tuchel. McTominay required far less persuasion, considering he was just 21 when he made his international bow, though the dilemma was comparable, as it too involved turning his back on his country of birth.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Speaking to The National in 2018, McTominay's grandfather, Frank, lauded [then-Scotland manager] Alex McLeish, Mourinho and United legend Ferguson for the way they guided his grandson through the predicament. And the latter's contribution proved especially crucial after Ferguson had been involved in the player's youth progression at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Alex McLeish handled the situation quite well,\" he said. \"It's been rumbling on for two or three months now in the papers. But he didn't go shouting and bawling. He just said that he would speak to Scott, and he did. He conducted himself quite well.",
      "\"But Sir Alex Ferguson was keen for Scott to play for Scotland as well. He was up front about it. I know that for a fact. I can say that without fear of getting contradicted. That has been kept under wraps. He and Jose Mourinho were both quite keen on it over the last month or two.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson has been very good with Scott over the years. He gave him his first contract with Manchester United when he was 16, before he retired, and then made sure it was extended when he was 18. He seems to get on well with him. I have seen them talking.\"",
      "Harvey Barnes is reportedly open to adopting Scotland as his new national team after being shunned by England(Image: Richard Lee/Shutterstock)",
      "Scottish supporters will also owe a debt of gratitude to Mourinho, who was outspoken in his view that McTominay should play for Scotland if England weren't interested. 'The Special One', who handed McTominay his United debut, completed some of his coaching qualifications in Largs, near Glasgow, and was eager to see Scotland secure the talent.",
      "Speaking to MUTV in early 2018, he made a phone gesture with his hand as he said: \"Because it looks like England is missing him, if I was Alex McLeish, the first thing I would do would be to come to me.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson recommended McTominay represent Scotland instead of his birth country(Image: Reach Plc)",
      "\"I think Scott deserves more than what he is getting,\" the Portuguese manager said after a 2-0 victory that secured his side's place in the quarter-finals. Maybe it's because he's this kind of kid profile: a normal haircut, no tattoos, no big cars, no big watches, humble kid, arrive in the club when he was nine or 10.\"",
      "One could suggest Barnes is in a comparable situation, undervalued and with limited prospects for success if he continues waiting for England. Scotland are reportedly seeking a decision from the winger before the March international break, at which point he and McTominay could feature in the same squad charting a course for North America later this year.",

      "Antoine Semenyo was the most expensive signing of the window(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "And there we have it. Thirty three days and £404.1million later, the January transfer window is closed.",
      "All 20 Premier League teams did business, some much more than others. Manchester City spent the most by signing Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo for a combined £94m - edging out Crystal Palace by £11m - while only Manchester United and Newcastle failed to make a single signing.",
      "We weren't short of sagas, though, whether it was the speculation over Mo Salah's future or Kobbie Mainoo going from outcast to undroppable. As ever, there was deadline-day drama involving the likes of Dwight McNeil, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Sandro Tonali.",
      "The transfer window produced one big winner and one obvious loser. Manchester City did outstanding business by signing Marc Guehi in a deal worth up to £30m, and to get Antoine Semenyo for £64m was amazing.",
      "To sign a brilliant defender - England's best central defender right now - for a bargain fee and then to get a proven Premier League winger for that fee gives Pep Guardiola a huge boost. Two top players who could win them major trophies this season but are also in for the long haul, all for less than £100m is brilliant business.",
      "But the biggest loser has to be Crystal Palace. They lost their captain when they sold Guehi to City.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta then made it clear that he wanted to leave and would have gone to AC Milan but for medical checks which now throw up doubts about his availability. Yes, they brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen but the damage this month has done - with Oliver Glasner also announcing he is leaving in the summer - has been catastrophic.",
      "Who are your winners and losers from the transfer window? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "Manchester City won the race for Marc Guehi(Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images)",
      "To be brutally honest, the January transfer window was so lacking in notable moves that there is a compelling case for it to be scrapped. But as the only club that did really serious business, you would have to say Manchester City had the best window in that they signed Marc Guehi, a true international-class defender.",
      "They also signed Antoine Semenyo but I'm not as convinced as most people seem to be that he will turn out to be a success at City. But Guehi can only be a good asset going forward, even if it might take him some time to get used to Pep Guardiola's way of thinking.",
      "Crystal Palace have had the worst window, by some distance. Not only have they lost Guehi, their main striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, does not want to play for them but they have not been able to sell him because of a physical issue. And the striker they have signed, Jorgen Strand Larsen, is massively overpriced at an initial £43m and has not been able to get into the worst team in the Premier League.",
      "Crystal Palace paid £43million plus £5m in add-ons for Jorgen Strand Larsen(Image: @CPFC/X)",
      "It might not have helped them close the gap on leaders Arsenal, but Manchester City's show of financial strength in the last transfer window made them the big winners when it came to new signings. The arrivals of Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo add youth and huge talent to Pep Guardiola's squad.",
      "Guehi, in particular, will not cost more than £30m and must be one of the bargains of recent times. Guehi's move to Manchester made a huge contribution to former club Crystal Palace having a shocking month.",
      "Aside from the furore surrounding manager Oliver Glasner, to lose a your captain and most influential member of the team for peanuts is damning on the Palace business model. Throw in the fact Jean-Philippe Mateta made it clear he wanted to leave, and would have gone to AC Milan but for failing a medical, and Palace, who have also overspent on Jorgen Strand Larsen, will be glad to see the window slam shut.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta failed his medical with AC Milan on deadline day(Image: MB Media/Getty Images)",
      "It has been a strange window which ended with more questionable decisions than the usual excitement. Manchester City had the best month on paper with the signings of Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi - probably the two best Premier League players not already at a Champions League club.",
      "But Sunday's draw at Tottenham showed the pair have not solved all Pep Guardiola's problems. The biggest spenders of the window were Crystal Palace - the FA Cup holders splashed £83m after not investing enough in the summer - but have come out weaker.",
      "The result only increases the chances of Oliver Glasner leaving before the end of the season. Losing Marc Guehi was a huge blow - and they have not signed a new defender. Breaking their club record for the first time to sign Brennan Johnson seemed to set out the South London club's early intent in the window.",
      "Then still bringing in Jorgen Strand Larsen for £48m in a seller's market even though the Jean-Philippe Mateta deal to AC Milan had collapsed makes neither footballing or financial sense.",
      "Brennan Johnson cost Crystal Palace £35million(Image:  Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "I'm not sure winning a transfer window is a great flex, but there's always a club who does the best business. The irony is if you'd asked the majority who had won the summer transfer window it could almost certainly have been Liverpool.",
      "Their recruitment drive though has seen them go from champions to a team now in a battle to make the Champions League spots. Kind of underlining the fact you win nothing by winning a transfer window. But if any club has this January then it would be City, purely because they landed Semenyo and Guehi. The window was lacking in major deals but Pep Guardiola did add one of the league's best wingers and one of England's elite defenders. The irony of course being its taken them no closer to the title, they're probably as far off as they were when January kicked off. That said, the two signings are proper players and will certainly aid the team for years to come. So good business nevertheless.",

Carrick has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham to move United into fourth and the visit of Thomas Frank's Spurs represents a chance to solidify their top-four status.",
      "There was no sign of Matthijs de Ligt or Mason Mount during the session, while Patrick Dorgu remains a long-term absentee. JJ Gabriel, 15, was one of five academy players involved, along with Yuel Helafu, Jack and Tyler Fletcher and Jack Moorhouse.",

      "Carrick's central role",
      "Anyone who spent time watching any part of Ruben Amorim's sessions can't fail to notice the difference between the Portuguese head coach and Carrick. Amorim would often observe parts of training from a distance, usually letting his coaching staff set up drills, and only getting involved to add weight to a message.",
      "Carrick is a modern, hands-on coach, and although he is in charge, he is also leading much of the training. After a warm-up, he set up a reasonably complicated passing drill and spent time getting it right before explaining it to the players himself.",
      "The 44-year-old led the group huddle before it began, then walked through the plan for the drill himself, explaining each part in detail to players and using some of them to show where they should be passing the ball and where they should be moving.",
      "It is clear that Carrick is very much a training-ground coach.",
      "Passing plan is clear",
      "The passing drill saw players exchanging short, sharp passes before moving on to the next station and carrying the ball down the pitch. It all looked pretty slick.",
      "MUTV pundit Danny Simpson noted that much of what he saw on the grass at Carrington this morning was similar to what he had seen in the three games so far, which is evidence that the message is getting through.",

      "Simpson revealed that after the cameras had gone off, there was an attack vs defence drill, with the group split into three teams and the fast-paced match played between the 18-yard boxes at either end of the pitch. It was another focus on keeping the ball under pressure, and we have seen United do just that under Carrick so far.",
      "Carrick's pleased",
      "Simpson had spoken to former teammates Carrick and Jonny Evans before training began and revealed that the head coach had praised the players' togetherness and work rate over the last three weeks.",
      "As an example of the former, he highlighted Joshua Zirkzee's reaction to Benjamin Sesko's injury-time winner against Fulham, even though the Slovenian's goal will likely make it harder for Zirkzee to get a game.",
      "Evans and Casemiro chat",
      "All of Carrick's coaching staff were out on the grass and involved with the players, and it was interesting to see Evans having a one-on-one chat with Casemiro at one point.",
      "Evans is the member of staff with the most recent playing experience, and he only hung up his boots last summer, so not only can he relate to the squad, but he has played with and knows most of them as well.",
      "Moorhouse's role",
      "JJ Gabriel's inclusion in first-team training for the second day in a row was the headline news for the academy, along with a call-up for 17-year-old Yuel Helafu, but it was interesting to see Jack Moorhouse involved.",
      "The 20-year-old only returned to the club from Leyton Orient late on deadline day, with concerns raised about his game time in the second half of the season as the League One club head for a relegation battle.",
      "Moorhouse gained valuable experience in playing 24 games for Leyton Orient and with numbers a little short in midfield at United, he could jump the queue ahead of Jack Fletcher for first-team involvement between now and the end of the season.",

      "JJ Gabriel was involved in first-team training at Manchester United for the second successive day with Michael Carrick including five academy graduates in his session. The 15-year-old was included in Tuesday's session with some senior players having a recovery day after the win against Fulham, but he kept his spot on Wednesday when Carrick stepped up preparations for the Premier League fixture against Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Gabriel is ineligible to play in Premier League games, but he is highly rated at United and has scored 11 goals in 16 games for the academy this season. His inclusion in first-team training on a more regular basis is evidence of the talent that United believe he possesses.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The forward was one of five youngsters to be included in the training session, along with midfield trio Jack Moorhouse and Jack and Tyler Fletcher. Moorhouse, 20, was recalled to the club from a loan spell at Leyton Orient late on deadline day.",
      "There was also a place in training for 17-year-old full-back Yuel Helafu. The right-back has made 11 appearances for the Under-18s this season and also featured on four occasions for the Under-21s in Premier League 2, as well as starting two of the EFL Trophy games.",

      "United will hope to sell Marcus Rashford this summer",
      "The January transfer window went as expected for Manchester United, who resisted the temptation to make any short-term moves for a season that has just 14 games left to run. Maybe there is an element of risk to that, but if the squad stays fit, they have proven recently that the quality is there to secure Champions League football.",
      "Three successive victories under Michael Carrick have moved United into fourth and the gap to Manchester City and Aston Villa has closed. The January gamble will pay off if things continue as they are.",
      "The long-term approach to transfers will set up a busy summer, when an overhaul in midfield will be the priority, but other positions could also be targeted, including left-wing, goalkeeper and possibly defence. Several players will be heading for the exit door.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "If United do secure a return to the Champions League, it will provide a significant boost to their revenues after a season without any European football and two early cup exits. A campaign of just 20 fixtures at Old Trafford will hurt the balance sheet, so a guarantee of what should really be at least five extra home games in Europe will be welcome.",
      "That should allow United to be a little more aggressive in the summer window, but their approach could also be dictated by departures and the kind of money made from exits. Casemiro's departure will free up significant room on the wage bill, and if Harry Maguire also leaves, that will be around £550,000-a-week in savings.",
      "Then there are sales and there are three obvious candidates to leave. Andre Onana, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund are all out on loan this season and the latter two have options to make that permanent as well.",
      "Hojlund's deal will see his move to Napoli become permanent for £38million if the reigning Serie A champions qualify for the Champions League, which is touch-and-go at the moment. Even if they don't, they are likely to try to keep him but will look to negotiate the fee.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Barcelona can make Rashford's loan move permanent for £30million but their financial difficulties could yet be an issue. The 28-year-old has been a success at the Nou Camp and wants to stay, while the Catalan giants want to keep him, but there could be some negotiation and for the forward to accept a pay cut.",
      "Onana might be a more difficult deal. There is no option in his last-minute loan move to Trabzonspor, although the 29-year-old has had a solid enough season in Turkey and has hopefully done enough to drum up some interest.",
      "The form of Senne Lammens has made it clear that Onana's days at United are over. He doesn't want to be a back-up goalkeeper, and he is paid too handsomely to fulfil that role as well, so finding a buyer will be the target.",
      "United's aim will be to secure deals for all three first-teamers currently out on loan as soon as possible. In a best-case scenario, there is potentially £100m in sales to be had there, although that might be difficult to pull off.",
      "In a window where United will be looking to strengthen the squad, that could be a substantial bonus, however, and a brilliant start to the window.",

      "United were busy in the loan market.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Seville and Rotherham were options for Manchester United youngster Gabriele Biancheri in the January transfer window, so you may be surprised to learn he relocated to South Yorkshire on deadline day.",
      "The coal-mining town won, despite being pitted against one of Spain's most picturesque cities. Biancheri will spend the next few months on loan at Rotherham, whereas Real Betis submitted a permanent bid for the youngster to join their B team, with a view to promoting him to their senior side.",
      "United rejected the bid from Betis and arranged for Biancheri to move to the New York Stadium. The forward's contract at Old Trafford expires in 2027, meaning there is still time for his value to increase.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Biancheri has not made the headlines that his peers in the academy may have produced over the last few seasons, but his goalscoring record is impressive: 42 goals in 82 United youth games.",
      "Biancheri has represented Wales throughout the age groups, but his heritage caught the attention of Canada, who called him up to their senior squad last summer. Cardiff-born Biancheri is eligible to represent the nations of his father (Italy) and his mother (Canada), as well as his birthplace (Wales).",
      "United hope Biancheri can continue to score goals for Rotherham. His size could be a sticking point in the football league, but his movement is a strength, and you don't need to be 6ft to succeed.",
      "It feels unlikely that Biancerhi will make a first-team debut at United, though. The best-case scenario may be that he continues to develop, improve and command a decent transfer fee when he is sold.",
      "Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is tasked with generating more revenue from sales of young players. Nick Cox raised more than £100million during his time in charge, but it has been identified as an area for improvement.",
      "Torpey helped Manchester City become one of the best exporters of academy players during his time in the blue half of Manchester. He is now trying to do the same job at Carrington.",
      "The academy's priority is to produce young players for the first team, but the reality is that most will not make a senior debut. United need to obtain higher fees for the academy players they sell, and arranging positive loans with these players will be key to doing so.",
      "Biancheri has a good record in front of goal.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "That is important context when looking at United's loan departures in the winter window. United loaned out six players, including Biancheri, most of whose futures will probably lie away from the club.",
      "Ethan Wheatley was recalled from his loan with Northampton. United sources confirmed the club wanted to pursue \"an alternative development opportunity\", and he was sent to Bradford City on deadline day.",
      "It was an interesting move. Wheatley made 20 league starts for Northampton and contributed three goals and four assists during his stint. United were pleased with his loan but still decided to recall him.",
      "In the past, game time for young players on loan was the priority, so it initially seemed strange that Wheatley was recalled. The young striker has joined Bradford, though, who are challenging for promotion in League One. In comparison, Northampton are trying to avoid relegation from that division.",
      "Wheatley has made a step up, joining a better team in the third tier, and he will gain valuable experience of being in a promotion-chasing dressing room, but he may not play as much.",
      "There is a possibility that Wheatley starts each game and fires Bradford to promotion, which would do him the world of good, however, it will be tougher for him to force his way into a better team.",
      "From the outside, it seems like United have recalled Wheatley from a club that could be relegated to send him to a promotion-chasing team. United believe that it's logical to send forwards somewhere they will receive more chances in front of the goal. Perhaps there is a bit of truth in both.",
      "United were happy with Wheatley at Northampton.(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "James Scanlon is another player who United should eventually be able to sell for a reasonable fee. Scanlon joined Swindon Town on loan on deadline day and will try to help them secure a play-off spot.",
      "The 19-year-old missed out on a move in the summer window. Scanlon has outgrown academy football and needed a fresh challenge, so it was a no-brainer to arrange a loan for him.",
      "Scanlon was born in the Midlands but represents Gibraltar on the international stage, and he scored a brilliant goal against the Faroe Islands in a World Cup qualifier last summer. His mature performances for Gibraltar against senior opposition have only enhanced his market value.",
      "The winger scored a hat-trick in front of Michael Carrick at Leigh Sports Village a week before leaving United on loan, and he will be relishing the chance to get a first taste of playing in the English pyramid.",
      "Scanlon will be managed by former Crystal Palace and Blackpool boss Ian Holloway, who is known for his quirks and colourful personality. Scanlon should at least not be bored during his time in Swindon.",
      "Jacob Devaney joined St. Mirren on deadline day. The youngster was born in Barnsley but has represented Ireland's youth national teams. In November, Devaney started for Ireland's U21s as they played against England in an Euro U21 qualifying fixture. He was one of the standout performers for his nation against the likes of Jobe Bellingham, Lewis Hall, Rico Lewis and Jamie Gittens.",
      "Devaney should receive regular game time in the Scottish Premiership, and it's understood the plan had always been for him to leave on loan, despite the move only happening on the final day.",
      "Toby Collyer and Harry Amass spent the first half of the season on loan with West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday respectively. Collyer will see out the campaign with Hull City, and Amass with Norwich City.",
      "Both players have made first-team appearances for United, so their situations differ from those of the other players sent on loan. They could both have long-term futures at Old Trafford.",
      "Collyer is hoping to start consistently for Hull as they look to push for a Championship play-off place, however, Amass picked up a hamstring injury after his arrival and is facing a stint on the sidelines.",
      "Amass enjoyed his time at Sheffield Wednesday. He won successive club player of the month awards, but United were essentially paying for Amass to play due to the Owls' financial problems.",
      "Finally, the loan deal that went under the radar was Jack Moorhouse's recall from Leyton Orient, who agreed with United to send Moorhouse back earlier than expected because they are fighting relegation.",
      "Orient felt Moorhouse's game time could be limited as they attempt to maintain their third-tier status. Their openness about the situation will help them land young players from United in the future.",

      "The midfield will receive an overhaul in the summer window. Casemiro is set to leave after his fourth season in Manchester, following last month's announcement that his contract will not be extended.

Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have also been tracked.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future at Old Trafford was uncertain throughout Ruben Amorim's tenure, but United will revisit negotiations with the young midfielder over a new deal.",
      "Michael Carrick has reintegrated Mainoo, starting him in impressive wins against City, Arsenal and Fulham. The Stockport-born midfielder is one of the lowest earners in the first team, having last signed a contract in 2023.",
      "It's understood that the performance-related bonuses in Mainoo's contract have all been triggered, increasing his salary, but his camp believes his wages still do not fairly reflect his role in the United squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes will decide his future after the World Cup. \"I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still,\" said Fernandes in October. \"My agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",
      "Before Christmas, United sources reiterated Ineos chiefs have no desire to sell Fernandes, who has contributed 12 assists in the Premier League this season. Fernandes' contract expires in 2027 and there is the option of extending by a further 12 months.",

      "With Casemiro set to leave the club at the end of the season, the midfield will be a department that desperately needs reinforcements at Old Trafford.",
      "Wharton has been touted as a potentially key figure in the United engine room with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson mooted.",
      "Hello and welcome to our dedicated Man United live-blog.",
      "The window may be closed but the rumour mill doesn't stop as we see United linked with players around the world and stars such as Bruno Fernandes touted with exits.",
      "It was a quiet January but let's see what the speculation is suggesting.",
      "It's been a busy day full of Manchester United news and gossip, even though the transfer window is now closed.",
      "Here are some of the top United stories from today:",
      "Marcus Rashford's future continues to be a subject of speculation as the Manchester United loanee enjoys his loan spell at Barcelona.",
      "The La Liga giants have the option to sign Rashford on a permanent basis for £26m in the summer, and there have been reports that the England international has no intentions of returning to United at the end of the season.",
      "United have held talks with Wolves over Mateus Mane, according to Sports Boom.",
      "Liverpool are also said to have done likewise, but both clubs were reportedly put off by a £45-50million asking price this winter. The 18-year-old forward has scored twice this season, both in back-to-back matches earlier this month.",
      "Carrick is getting a tune out of this current United squad, but that does not necessarily mean he would have chosen not to purchase anyone, given the option. The Reds were happy to stick to the long-term plan and not sign anyone this Januar,y and that is exactly what played out.",
      "Danny Simpson is backing Harry Maguire to get a new contract.",
      "Simpson told the Metro:",
      "I think it would be very silly to let him go. We know what he's been through, the way he's come back and shown his resilience. He's had some big moments and big winners as well in recent times. We need him in the box, defending and attacking. I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get a new deal.",
      "I think he deserves a new deal for his performances. It's not just on the pitch, I know what he's like off the pitch. He's a leader. So for me it'd be silly to let Harry go. And I'm sure he wants to play every game, but when he's not, he still supports the lads. He'll be on the bench, and when he's needed, he'll come and perform. So hopefully they sort that contract out soon.",
      "United officials are focusing solely on rebuilding the team's midfield rather than also remaining open to signing another centre-forward, according to The i Paper.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's conduct around Carrington is said to have changed their stance, meaning their sights are firmly set on the middle of the pitch. More than one midfielder is reportedly likely.",
      "Danny Simpson believes Sandro Tonali could slot into the United midfield this summer.",
      "Simpson told the Metro:",
      "I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield. I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "Obviously, he's been a top player for Newcastle. He's good on the ball, he's strong, he's physical, he'd be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",
      "Also, he's the type of player that I think could wear a Man Utd shirt. It's not easy, that, and I feel like he could wear it with the pressure and deal with it. He could definitely slot in there.",
      "How do you rate a window in which United made no signings? It's pretty difficult, but United were happy not to be active because their long-term targets were not available. It wasn't an exciting transfer window by any means, however, it's better to keep your powder dry than to spend on a signing who may not be quite right. United will focus their resources on the summer transfer window and invest heavily to strengthen the midfield, which is set to be overhauled.",
      "Galatasaray are pushing to sign Manuel Ugarte on loan with an option to make the move permanent, according to Turkish-Football.",
      "The Istanbul club are reportedly in contact with the player's representatives. Ugarte is said to be attracted to the prospect of playing in the Champions League and alongside Victor Osimhen.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is said to be upset that United blocked a deadline-day exit for him yesterday.",
      "The Mirror claims he was due to join a team in Turkey. However, he was reportedly denied a move by director of football Jason Wilcox after being told to turn around before boarding a flight to the country for a medical. Though the publication states that, to their knowledge, no deal or travel was ever agreed upon between the club and the player.",
      "United have made moves for Federico Valverde, according to El Nacional.",
      "Chelsea are also credited with an interest in the Uruguay international. Both clubs have reportedly made Valverde offers to leave Madrid, which the player is said to have sent his current employers, making it clear he is thinking of leaving.",
      "I was young when I made my debut at United. I was young, so learning a lot about the game, so it's exciting to be back [in the Premier League]. Being around top-level, elite players with England, you take in as much as you can from them. Coming here [to Wolverhampton Wanderers], I'll try and show what I can do, what I'm about, try and be a positive addition to the team, and try to be as positive as possible to help in all aspects.",
      "Premier League clubs can no longer bring in new signings, aside from free agents, but they can still move players out for a short period. That's because several overseas leagues operate on different transfer calendars, with their windows remaining open.",
      "Portugal and Netherlands - February 2.",
      "Turkey and Greece - February 6.",
      "Austria - Runs between December 31 and February 6.",
      "Poland - February 25.",
      "Switzerland - February 16.",
      "MLS - Between January 26 and March 26.",
      "With one transfer window out of the way, all eyes now turn to the next one. It was a quiet January at Man United, but it is expected to be anything but a quiet summer.",
      "There are just over four months until the Premier League window opens, and United's priority is already clear. They went into January aware that midfield was a potential area of weakness, but only tried to sign a winger.",
      "United spent more than £215million in the summer and a similar outlay could be expected in 2026. Midfield will be the main focus. Casemiro's departure will save more than £18million a season if United are back in the Champions League, but replacing him will be difficult.",

That came as a surprise to some United fans as Sesko and Zirkzee have been battling for first-team minutes throughout most of the season.",

      "The ball had fallen to Chukwueze inside the box after Raul Jimenez's free-kick hit the wall, and the former's snapshot was blocked by Lisandro Martinez before Cuenca was there to prod into the back of the net. However, following a long check, VAR decided to rule out the goal as it was viewed that Chukwueze was offside in the build-up.",

      "With United leading 2-0 thanks to goals either side of half-time from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, Fulham did eventually pull one back in the 85th minute and it came from the penalty spot. After Harry Maguire fouled Jimenez inside the area, the Mexican pulled himself back up to score from 12 yards.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",

      "Will Manchester United rival Arsenal for the signing of Sandro Tonali from Newcastle in the summer?",
      "Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg caused a stir on deadline day when he claimed Arsenal had made an approach to sign the Italy international from the Magpies.",
      "Another journalist Ben Jacobs then took to X to write: ‘Understand Arsenal haven’t made contact for Sandro Tonali and Newcastle’s position is the midfielder is not for sale.’",
      "Before David Ornstein of The Athletic insisted that Tonali had been ‘offered to Arsenal’ by the Newcastle star’s agent with ‘no contact’ made with the Geordies over a potential transfer.",
      "But Tonali’s agent, Giuseppe Riso, claimed that he hadn’t spoken to Arsenal about a potential move and insisted that the Newcastle star’s future is something to talk about more in March.",
      "Riso told Sky Sport in Italy: “Newcastle won’t let Sandro leave in January. We haven’t spoken to Arsenal about this opportunity. Juventus? This isn’t the time to talk about it.”",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Arsenal ‘out-thought’ by Chelsea but ‘squeeze through’ before Guardiola controversy",
      "The agent added: “It’s not even being discussed now. We will see around March about Sandro’s valuation but only if Newcastle decide to open doors. He’s completely focused on Newcastle’s season now, it’s a nonsense topic.”",
      "And now Romano has revealed that Arsenal are still interested in signing the 25-year-old and that he expects Tonali and Newcastle to hold talks over his future between February and April.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “There has been a lot of confusion around Sandro Tonali, but his agent, Giuseppe Rizzo, was very clear in the last 24 hours that the player was not offered to Arsenal.",
      "“It would have been completely unrealistic to try to sign a player of Tonali’s level in the final 24 hours of the market, especially considering how long similar deals normally take.",
      "MAILBOX: Chelsea labelled ‘pathetic’ three times over after Arsenal bore to final",
      "“For the summer, however, Tonali is a name to watch. Arsenal remain interested, and there is also strong interest from Juventus and other top clubs in England.",
      "“The next key step will be discussions with Newcastle United between February and April, because any decision will depend on the club’s position and future plans.”",
      "Former Premier League full-back Danny Simpson, who began his career at Manchester United and played a key role for Leicester when they won the title in 2015/16, says his boyhood club should be going after Tonali, who he believes would dovetail “really nicely” with Kobbie Mainoo in the Red Devils’ midfield.",
      "“I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield,” Simpson told Metro via Meta Spins Casino.",
      "“I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a top player for Newcastle. He’s good on the ball, he’s strong, he’s physical, he’d be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",
      "“Also, he’s the type of player that I think could wear a Man Utd shirt. It’s not easy, that, and I feel like he could wear it with the pressure and deal with it.",
      "“He could definitely slot in there.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Arsenal ‘remain interested’ in Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali ahead of the summer.",

      "Sandro Tonali being touted to Arsenal wasn’t the last act of the January transfer window but the first of what looks like another long summer for Newcastle.",
      "Sandro Tonali is expected to take stock of his future at Newcastle United this summer and there WAS Arsenal contact.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United are ‘braced’ for ‘offers’ from three Premier League clubs for Sandro Tonali after he was linked with Arsenal."

In this context, he offered Real Madrid a very different return than in previous spells, accepting a secondary role and making no demands in terms of sporting achievements.",
      "‘However, the club doesn’t see it that way. Alvaro Arbeloa has been clear with the sporting director that Cristiano Ronaldo’s return would pose an unnecessary risk internally. Even if the Portuguese player is willing to accept a substitute role, no one in the dressing room believes his presence could coexist with that without creating tension.’",

      "The England international was expected to leave at the end of the season under Ruben Amorim but there are rumours that Carrick wants to keep him on.",
      "Giving updates on Man Utd duo Maguire and Onana, Romano said on his YouTube channel: “At Manchester United, there is still no final decision on Harry Maguire. The club are happy with his performances and have held initial talks with his agents, but no agreement has been reached on salary or contract terms.",
      "“Maguire is out of contract in the summer, and while United blocked approaches from Italian clubs in January, his future remains open.",
      "“In terms of departures, André Onana is expected to leave the club next summer. United do not plan to continue with him beyond his current situation, and several clubs are already showing interest.",
      "“A permanent deal would be very different financially compared to a loan, especially considering Onana’s salary, and this will be a key factor in any future negotiations.",

      "“I think that Carrick can understand the value he brings in the dressing room as well as on the pitch. He’s playing more as himself, I think as well, but certainly it’s more of a unity and an actual vision of where United are as a human group.",

They’ll probably give him two years or maybe one with an option and I think that they’ll be better off for it and I think everybody’s going to start settling down and getting some unity in the squad, which is what they needed.”",

      "Now, a report from The Athletic claims Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ‘all hugely admired’ by Man Utd, but the Nottingham Forest and England star is ‘considered their first-choice target’.",
      "The report has listed four potential next transfers for Man Utd, with a second midfielder to be targeted as Manuel Ugarte’s ‘future is uncertain’, while the ‘left-wing could also be looked at’.",

      "“He’s broken into the England squad at a young age alongside the likes of Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White – these kind of players are there to prove something and make a difference to the sides they feature in.",
      "“Crystal Palace are a weird one in the sense that they probably don’t get as much publicity as they deserve especially after winning the FA Cup last season, so players like Wharton sometimes fly under the radar with their performances. Wharton however is exactly the type of player United should be buying.”",

      "Manchester United have moved to accelerate contract talks with midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, with discussions pencilled in for this month, TEAMtalk understands.",
      "Sources indicate that Man Utd director of football, Jason Wilcox, has already made contact with Mainoo’s camp, offering reassurances over the club’s long-term vision for the academy graduate.",
      "Wilcox is understood to have made it clear that the decision not to entertain offers for Mainoo was his, even during a period when the youngster found himself out of favour under former head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Since Amorim’s departure, Man Utd interim-manager Michael Carrick has wasted no time in restoring the £60m-rated midfielder to a central role.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder, who has earned 10 England caps so far in his career, has responded emphatically, delivering standout performances in statement victories over Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Mainoo’s resurgence has not gone unnoticed inside Old Trafford, where senior figures now view him as a cornerstone of the club’s rebuild.",
      "Talks over a new deal were first initiated back in 2024, but momentum stalled amid managerial uncertainty.",
      "With Carrick’s faith in the midfielder now clear and Wilcox driving the process, Man Utd are ready to push ahead.",
      "Sources have told us that Wilcox will sit down with Mainoo and his representatives in the coming weeks, and there is growing confidence that an agreement could be reached swiftly.",
      "The expectation is that Mainoo will be rewarded with a significantly improved contract that reflects both his current impact and his projected importance to the team.",
      "Man Utd see this as a priority piece of business – and all indications suggest it could move quickly.",
      "Mainoo came through the Man Utd youth academy and is currently under contract at the Premier League club until the summer of 2027, with the Red Devils having the option to extend it by another year.",
      "The 20-year-old has made 89 appearances for the Man Utd first team so far in his career, scoring seven goals and providing four assists in the process.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Like the Man Utd hierarchy, Rio Ferdinand has also been hugely impressed with Mainoo’s performances under Carrick.",
      "The former Man Utd defender said on his YouTube channel: “Kobbie Mainoo’s superpowers are that he’s press-resistant, and he can beat the press.",
      "“His ability to manipulate the ball and use his body to get out of any situation in any area of the pitch, and to have the balls to say ‘I want to take the ball in those tight areas.’",
      "“There are a lot of players who can do this in training sessions, but when it comes to a match, forget doing it, they don’t even show to receive the ball to do it.",
      "“Kobbie Mainoo has done it at the highest level, in finals where he has been the main player to win games for Man United and England in a tournament.",
      "“That’s a superpower in his game, and sometimes you think ‘well, he might be a little bit weak here and there, but if I can get him in the position to do that, it doesn’t matter so much’… This kid, his talent.”",

      "What better way to celebrate the end of another January transfer window than with a bonus England Ladder?",
      "Stop trying to think of better ones. There aren’t any.",
      "It’s an admittedly rogue time for us to be attempting a Ladder, with the vital and often missed point being that this isn’t our list but our best guess at the manager’s list. It is inevitably harder to gauge the manager’s current thoughts when you don’t have his very recent actual choices to go on, like we do at standard post-interlull Ladder time.",
      "Yet it does also feel like quite a lot has changed since November for quite a lot of players. Those now clearly obsolete rankings are in brackets below, with the full irrelevant arguments here if you’re that way inclined.",
      "",
      "We can rattle through the first few of these nice and quick, because as long as they remain upright and don’t suffer a catastrophic collapse in form they are of no concern.",
      "",
      "See? Very easy, this bit.",
      "",
      "Very, very easy. It will not remain this easy.",
      "",
      "The first significant mover, because James’ absence from the group of nailed-on certainties has never been about ability or suitability but availability. And this season James has already played more Premier League football than any since 21/22, and had more minutes on a Premier League pitch than in the last two campaigns combined.",
      "Midfield versatility always a boon, but for England his main job is clear. He’s the right-back, and it solves an awful, awful lot.",
      "",
      "Sketchy recent form isn’t ideal but nobody is pretending Tuchel is remotely likely to, by choice, have anyone else on the right side of England’s attack next summer.",
      "",
      "Hard to think of anyone who in the space of six caps has so commandingly claimed an England starting spot. Has still played every minute of this Premier League season and the re-emergence of your Conor Gallaghers and Kobbie Mainoos adds depth to the midfield argument but they are very much squabbling for squad places behind Anderson at this time.",
      "His passing is very, very good. As illustrated by football analysts Gradient Sports.",
      "",
      "Ahead of the injured John Stones in the pecking order now, for club and country.",
      "",
      "If there were an international break happening right now, it would be a Guehi-Konsa defensive pairing for England and there’s a good chance that will still be true in March when there is one and also the summer. Squad certainty either way.",
      "",
      "Get ready for a lot more chat about his attitude and family and above all his unwillingness to just dance to the media’s tune that makes you want to grind your teeth into powdery stumps next month. Absolutely is not helping himself, though, by having an underwhelming season.",
      "",
      "Has been Tuchel’s go-to man on the left and we have to assume remains so. Hasn’t dazzled in the Premier League this season, but eye-catching Champions League form doesn’t hurt.",
      "",
      "Left-back remains the trickiest position to pin down, because there are lots of options and Tuchel has tried most of them. O’Reilly is the man in possession, still playing regularly for Man City – albeit shuffled into midfield last weekend – and therefore remains cautiously pencilled in.",
      "",
      "The return to fitness and prominence of Cole Palmer will ask questions of Rogers, but he is for now still at worst Jude Bellingham’s back-up at No. 10 because there is no reason for that not to be so.",

      "If he stays fit, he stays in. Zero chance he displaces Pickford, zero chance he loses his place in the squad.",
      "",
      "Has been in and out of the Brentford side in recent weeks, but we’re really not sure that matters given the specific reasons Tuchel likes having Henderson around and his role within the squad. It’s not quite player-coach, but there’s definitely a sense of Henderson existing as a conduit between the players and coaches, while his on-field role is around sorting out the closing minutes of games as a wise head on fresh legs. Doesn’t need to be starting every week for Brentford to stay sharp for that.",
      "",
      "Ended the November break looking like a shoo-in for the XI never mind the squad, but has barely played since due to another frustrating injury.",
      "You’d imagine Tuchel will still be desperately keen to pick him, but there are other experienced options playing a lot more football right now.",
      "",
      "Gets a decent passing grade for his work at Barcelona, and remains an uncomplicated choice for a tournament squad. Looks more and more like it’s a straight Gordon v Rashford fight for the left-wing starting spot, with both almost certain to be on the plane.",
      "Ball-carrying feels like it might be an issue, mind…",
      "",
      "We still had him inside the cut line in November when he had barely played this season. Is playing regularly now, and surely makes a 26-man squad for his big-game minerals alone. Scored in the Euros final and ran the Club World Cup final. You’d be happier looking along an England bench and having him there, wouldn’t you?",
      "",
      "Back in the Newcastle team at Liverpool after six weeks out, and we’ll not dwell too much on how that went and consider instead the fact that Tuchel has picked him in every England squad for the last year and the ladder is, as always, our best (if in this particularly instalment even sketchier than normal) guess at his plans rather than our own.",
      "",
      "Returned from injury just before the last international break but too late to be realistically considered for a call-up. But has been quietly and effectively pretty much ever-present for Newcastle since then and that absolutely could and probably should be enough to get him one of the left-back spots. None of the other contenders to join O’Reilly in the squad have been as consistent since November in terms of level or the underrated yet key ability to simply get themselves on the pitch in that position.",
      "",
      "Feels like this was a particularly bad time to get injured, putting him out of sight and mind in the run-up to the next squad. Most obviously directly hands an opportunity to Tammy Abraham at club level that could yet ask questions at international level while also offering encouragement to the Dominics Calvert-Lewin and Solanke and even Ivan Toney.",
      "",
      "Feels very ‘Foden and England’ that he scored six goals in four Premier League games almost immediately after the last international break but hasn’t scored a Premier League goal in his last eight games as we approach the next one. The timing just always seems to be off.",
      "",
      "Adam Wharton remains Adam Wharton, and we love that for him. But we’re not so sure Tuchel really does. He offers such a tantalising point of difference but with Rice and Anderson locked-in starters, Henderson cast as key lieutenant and both Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo now so visibly back on the scene there is a scramble for midfield spots. We think he still has the edge, for now.",
      "",
      "Ruled out for two months with a hamstring injury on January 14. The international break starts on March 23. It’s sh*tty luck at a sh*tty time for a player who feels like he sits right on the bubble and for whom that luck is most sh*tty. Just the worst possible position to be in: someone who would almost certainly make the squad if fit, but who doesn’t quite have enough heft or credit in the bank to not need to still earn it on the pitch. It’s a good old-fashioned race against time.",
      "If he’s back playing before the break, we suspect Tuchel will go for him over a Spence or a Shaw.",
      "",
      "We would probably go with Nick Pope, but we think Tuchel sticks with what he knows here. Unless you are yourself James Trafford or Nick Pope, it doesn’t really matter.",
      "",
      "He’s back in the Man United team and thus firmly back in the mix. We reckon there are five squad places for central midfielders. Rice, Anderson and Henderson will be three of them, and Mainoo is now once again a significant part of a conversation also involving your Whartons, Scotts and Gallaghers if not now perhaps the Loftus-Cheeks of this world.",
      "We tentatively lean towards what he did at the Euros counting for a lot with Tuchel, who we suspect has just been waiting/hoping for exactly this kind of extended run in the United side.",
      "",
      "No coincidence that his own form has improved in direct relation to West Ham coming back from the dead, and with Noni Madueke struggling for playing time the Bukayo Saka understudy gig does once again seem to be up for grabs.",
      "Tuchel’s selection policy has always been an interesting and we think rather clever balance of rewarding both current club form and previous England form. With this longer gap between international squads, our thinking is he will lean slightly more heavily on the former than latter. If he does, Bowen is definitely ahead.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick replacing Ruben Amorim has already reshaped Manchester United, but what might it mean for England? Maguire is back playing regularly and knows his way around a summer tournament better than almost any other England player. With Stones a doubt and nobody else beyond Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa having locked down a squad place, why not Maguire?",
      "We already know from Henderson’s return that Tuchel values and requires members of the playing group with those battle-hardened leadership qualities, and it’s quite a green defensive group if Stones isn’t in it.",
      "",
      "Has always been very good when Tuchel has called upon him, and we know this is a manager for whom that counts for an awful lot. But if you were picking a squad right now on current form it would be extremely hard to justify Madueke over, say, Jarrod Bowen.",
      "",
      "Scored a hat-trick against Spurs straight after the international break, which was good, but hasn’t scored or assisted a Premier League goal since, which is bad. Simply does not have the England record to remain secure in the squad while becoming as peripheral as he has at club level.",
      "",
      "Every chance, you know. Left-back is the most up-in-the-air position of the lot, and Shaw is playing there again now Man United are free at last of Ruben Amorim’s back-three tyranny. There’s a certain irony in the fact Shaw and Reece James also now appear to be England’s most injury-resistant full-back options, having managed 47 out of a possible 48 Premier League appearances this season between them.",
      "Would bring a wealth of experience to a defence that could use that if it is indeed a perfectly capable but not particularly tournament-hardened Guehi-Konsa central pairing, as well as providing an experienced LCB option in a back three.",
      "",
      "Did absolutely nothing wrong when called upon in October but usurped by Nico O’Reilly in November and now as injured as all Spurs players must be. Ability to play both flanks still works in his favour but also now, through no real fault of his own, probably in a position where he needs to play himself back into the 26.",
      "",
      "Four goals in four games since returning from a frustratingly persistent injury and coming into a genuinely terrible Tottenham team at a horrifically low ebb.",
      "Scoring an outrageous scorpion kick as one of your two goals against Man City in front of the watching England manager is certainly not a bad idea.",
      "What’s interesting about Solanke is, while obviously not approaching Harry Kane’s class, he is probably the closest England have available in terms of all-round playing style. So it could come down to what, exactly, Tuchel is looking for in his Kane back-up: a point of difference, or an inevitably inferior but passable facsimile.",
      "",
      "A badly timed injury cost him in November. A goalkeeper who is playing week in, week out for a Champions League club should logically be a better choice as third-choice keeper than someone who is not doing that, but we’re just not sure it’s something Tuchel is going to be spending much time faffing about with this close to tournament time.",
      "",
      "Played right-back in England’s last qualifier, and ‘back-up right-back’ does look like it might be a position available to a versatile, utility-player sort – whether that’s a full-back who can play either side (a Spence, a Livramento) or a Jarell Quansah/Joe Gomez type who can shuffle across from their preferred centre-back spot.",
      "",
      "Whether it makes Tuchel more likely to pick you we’re not so sure, but you’re certainly going to get talked about more as a possible England selection if you’re playing in England. Gallagher is now doing so again, and will have done himself no harm at all with that all-action effort against Man City in front of the England coach at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Is a player Tuchel knows from Chelsea, which we’ve already seen count for something, but also one of the accursed gang whose sole England appearance under the current manager came in the Game We Don’t Like To Talk About against Senegal.",
      "",
      "Couldn’t even nail down the right-back spot when he was one of Liverpool’s best and most visible players and Reece James was pretty much always injured. Is not about to do so while he is struggling to get a game for Real Madrid and Reece James is pretty much always available.",
      "In terms of the squad, we still rule nothing out because there is no current compelling back-up right-back and a fresh Alexander-Arnold with a point to prove is a very tempting wildcard in a 26-man group.",
      "The facts are, though, that he hasn’t been part of an England squad since last summer. If he were already in the squad, his Real Madrid struggles might be overlooked; but he’s in the position of trying to force his way in and just isn’t doing enough.",
      "",
      "Bellingham, Rogers, Palmer is already a difficult pack to burst through for one of the No. 10 spots, and that’s before you consider the likes of Foden or Eze who could play there or elsewhere. Looks like a losing battle at this time.",

      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",

      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",

      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",
