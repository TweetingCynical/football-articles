      "Eric Cantona wrote himself into the Manchester United history books through his five years under Sir Alex Ferguson, but he easily could have ended up at Liverpool",
      "Eric Cantona is a Manchester United legend, yet things could have been very different but for the decision of Liverpool manager Graeme Souness.",
      "Cantona arrived in England at Leeds in 1992 following a trial at Sheffield Wednesday and ended up at Old Trafford, where he became a mercurial hero under Sir Alex Ferguson. Those five eventful years at United came after he made a name for himself in his native France – both for his talent and his behaviour.",
      "And it was ultimately the latter of those characteristics which saw Souness decide against taking the risk. The Liverpool boss was offered the chance to sign Cantona, but instead went for what he perceived to be the safer option of Istvan Kozma, who arrived from Dunfermline for £300,000 in February 1992.",
      "Souness has since explained his thinking in rejecting Cantona. \"I was manager of Liverpool and we played Auxerre in the cup winners' cup and we lost 2-0 away, we came back and beat them 3-0,\" Souness explained on The Football Show in 2020. \"After the game, Terry Littlewood, who used to look after the players' lounge and my lounge, security-wise, knocked on my door and said there's a pal outside, he's a good friend of yours and he wants to speak to you.",
      "\"I said 'who is it?' and he said 'it's Michel Platini'. Not a close pal of mine, the only time I had come in contact with him was when I played against him when I was in Italy. He came in and said 'I've got a player for you, he's a real problem in France but he's really talented and he'd be perfect for your club'. I said 'look, Michel, I'm fighting fires here at the moment, I'm trying to get some people out of the door that are resisting, I'm fighting a dressing room here. The last thing I need is another controversial figure'.",
      "\"Eric of course then came over on trial with Sheffield Wednesday, then signed for Leeds and the rest is history. When he went to United, it was a young team and young players need someone like that on the pitch to look up to. I think Eric was certainly one of them.\"",
      "The story of Cantona at United is well-known – and the fact Kozma’s time at Liverpool is less well documented says a lot about how it went. The Hungary international only played 10 times for the Reds in the end, failing to make an impression at Anfield.",
      "The midfielder made his debut as a second-half substitute in a goalless draw at Ipswich Town in the FA Cup fifth round before a forgettable first start in a 3-0 defeat by Norwich. His first three starts for the club saw Liverpool fail to score a single goal.",
      "His crowning achievement came when he came on as a half-time substitute with the team 3-0 down against Chesterfield in the League Cup. To his credit, Kozma made a difference, setting up goals for Ronny Rosenthal and Mark Wright as Liverpool drew 4-4 in front of a measly crowd at Anfield.",
      "He stuck around for the 1992/93 season, without getting into the team, and was forced to leave at the end of the campaign when his lack of appearances meant he wasn’t granted a work permit. Kozma went back to Hungary to play for Ujpest and had a stint in Cyprus with APOEL before seeing out his career in his homeland.",
      "It wasn’t all bad. Although he didn’t play, Kozma was at Wembley for Liverpool’s FA Cup final win over Sunderland in May 1992 – and it made an impression on him. \"It was still the old Wembley and a full house,\" he recalled in 2021.",
      "\"We were sitting behind the bench. The next day we went home to Liverpool, a huge celebration began. First we were taken around the city on an open double decker bus where a lot of scarves were thrown at us. It was a huge experience. I still keep a few of the things.\"",

      "Majority owners the Glazer family have been unpopular with sections of the fanbase, some of whom have welcomed the arrival of British billionaire Ratcliffe. However, while future decisions are expected to be made with the input of the new investor, the Old Trafford plans are understood to predate his arrival.",
      "Results have picked up of late for United, who beat West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday. It followed a dramatic midweek victory away to Wolves, ensuring back-to-back league wins for Erik ten Hag's side for the first time since November.",
      "The relationship between the Glazers and some fans hasn't been the best even when results were altogether more impressive last season, though. Now, a rise of five per cent across the board on season ticket prices are unlikely to improve that situation.",
      "Not only will fans have to pay more next season, a second successive annual increase, but some will be moved to new seats. According to The Mail, those in the Sir Bobby Charlton stand are due to be relocated to accommodate the families of players.",
      "Those in corporate seats will also face higher bills, with some forced to fork out an extra £500 per year. According to communication from United, the changes are designed to ensure the club \"operates on a sustainable basis and to support investment in the team and stadium\".",
      "United have regularly enjoyed attendances north of 70,000 this season, even with the club struggling in Europe and spending the entire league season outside the Champions League spots. Indeed, Sunday's match against West Ham represented their highest attendance of the campaign at 73,612.",
      "On the field, the late midweek drama at Wolves was followed by an altogether more comfortable win at Old Trafford on Sunday. Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, getting among the goals for the fourth straight game, and Alejandro Garnacho struck twice in the second half after West Ham spurned chances to draw level.",
      "Ten Hag insisted he wouldn't be over-celebrating after his team's biggest home win of the season, but pointed to some of the positives. \"For today, we are pleased with it, but you need routines to get consistent performances,\" he said.",
      "\"So, you have to make decisions. You have to make decisions in a split second. And when every time you have to swap your team, you have to swap your centre-halves, you have to swap your back four, positioning the right full-back to the left full-back and then swap back again.",
      "\"All those adjustments, all those are rules and principles who they know. It's about looking at each other, taking the right decisions. Top football is about details, and when one detail doesn't work, and you concede goals, and then you're following the facts and we had that too much this season.\""

      "The forward was absent for the FA Cup win over Newport County last Sunday with Erik ten Hag citing an \"internal matter\". Rashford was pictured in a Belfast nightclub and subsequently missed training the following day, claiming he was ill.",
      "Ten Hag has since revealed he considers the matter closed after speaking with Rashford and his representatives. The England international has copped a huge fine, but that made his appearance in the programme all the more awkward. He posed alongside women's star Mary Earps to advertise Chivas Regal - the whisky brand .",
      "The United boss said on the player's responsibilities: “The players at this level need to manage themselves. That is what you can demand from the player. The player has to know what is good and not good. When you want to play top football, it demands a certain way of life. Always.”",

His body language on the pitch has been criticised with Rashford previously dipping in and out of form throughout his career.",

      "Gary Neville confessed he was concerned about the conduct of the United forward. He told the Stick to Football podcast: “I’m a little bit worried [about Marcus Rashford ]. I think when someone who's been as peaceful and quiet for the last seven or eight years – almost in some ways perfect for 10 years in terms of his behaviour – and then the last four months, there’s a couple of things that’s happened.",

      "Moyes' team won the reverse fixture back in December but couldn't get on the scoreboard this time around. Rasmus Hojlund put the hosts ahead in the first half, with Alejandro Garnacho adding a brace of his own after the break.",
      "Former United manager Moyes has yet to record an away league win against his old club, though he did lead West Ham to a Carabao Cup victory at Old Trafford in 2021. Sunday's loss was a fourth straight defeat to nil in this fixture in the league, after 1-0 losses in each of the last three seasons.",
      "West Ham had chances to get on the scoresheet, with left-back Emerson spurning arguably the best chance shortly before Garnacho doubled United's lead. Speaking after the game, Moyes made it clear he didn't consider it a 3-0 game.",
      "\"No I don't think the scoreline was correct,\" the Scot told Match of the Day. \"Our performance in the main was much better. I am pleased with that but obviously not pleased with different aspects, we didn't finish chances. Overall we played better and our performance was better today.\"",
      "When asked about Emerson's miss, he said: \"That tells you it just was not going to be our day. They broke away and they shoot and it takes a big deflection and that makes it 2-0.",
      "\"We have been on a pretty good run without being at our best, with some players also away,\" he added. \"I thought today we looked like it but goals have been a little hard to come by. Hopefully there's a wee bit of mitigating circumstances and hopefully the goals will start flowing in the coming weeks.\"",
      "",
      "West Ham have been without some key players in recent weeks, though they were able to welcome back Nayef Aguerd after the Morocco defender's AFCON exploits. Michail Antonio and Lucas Paqueta are among the high-profile absentees, while the London club allowed Pablo Fornals and Said Benrahma to leave at the end of the transfer window.",

      "The victors have an injury concern of their own, with Lisandro Martinez - only recently back from months out - unable to finish the game. \"It seems bad,\" United boss Erik ten Hag said.",
      "\"We have to wait, make the right diagnosis in the coming days and then we will see. Hopefully it is not too bad, we can only pray. He worked so hard to return and now after two games it looks like he has to sit some games out again.\""

And with 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo continuing to impress with another composed display, the future would appear to be in safe hands at United, despite their inconsistencies this season.",
      "It says everything about United's failings that this was the first home league game this season they have won by more than one goal, victory lifting them up from eighth to sixth place. They may still be eight points off fourth spot, but with 15 games remaining, United have gathered some momentum as they continue to make a late and unlikely push for a Champions League spot.",

The ball fell into the path of Hojlund, who sent two opponents the wrong way with his quick movement, before burying an unstoppable shot past Alphonse Areola.",
      "Despite going ahead, United were unable to build on it and frustrated their fans with their willingness to sit on their lead and invite West Ham on to them. The visitors created a host of first-half chances but were unable to convert any of them and were dealt a blow when Areola, who had collided with team-mate Kurt Zouma in the first-half, did not emerge for the restart, replaced in goal by Lukasz Fabianski",
      "The Hammers had a chance to level three minutes after the restart, when a lapse in concentration from Harry Maguire allowed Emerson Palmieri to take possession and surge forward. Emerson chose to go it alone, despite options to his right, his decision proving to be the wrong one as he scuffed his shot high and wide.",
      "It proved a significant miss, with United doubling their lead within two minutes, a shot from Garnacho deflecting off Nayef Aguerd, giving Fabianski no chance.",
      "Jarrod Bowen found himself through on goal in the 69th minute, with only Onana to beat, but delayed shooting long enough to allow Diogo Dalot to race back and block his goalbound strike.",
      "United lost Martinez with 20 minutes to go, the defender failing to recover after falling awkwardly minutes earlier when trying to shield the ball from Vladimir Coufal. Any hopes West Ham had of getting back into the game ended six minutes from time, when United counter-attacked, with substitute Scott McTominay setting up Garnacho for his second goal."

      "It appears Garnacho was providing a firm response as he repeated the celebration after a second goal. He took his place by the Sir Alex Ferguson stand after a cool finish to put his side 3-0 up at Old Trafford.",
      "Kudus produced the celebration when West Ham defeat United in December. The Ghana winger scored the Hammers' second goal on that occasion as David Moyes earned a 2-0 win over his former team after Jarrod Bowen had opened the scoring.",
      "Kudus took his set on the advertising boards in front of West Ham's fans at the London stadium on that occasion and Garnacho could not resist calling back to the moment.",
      "The moment also allowed Garnacho to collect another celebration reminiscent of a Cristiano Ronaldo effort. United's star has been launching into the former Real Madrid star's ‘SIU’ celebration and copied Ronaldo’s ‘sleeping’ celebration by closing his eyes and interlocking his hands over his chest too.",
      "Argentina ace Angel Di Maria has even warned Garnacho to avoid such actions. Speaking to Ole, he said: “The only thing I wouldn’t do is celebrate Cristiano. I would score the goal and I would do like Messi does. I’ll stick with that.\""

      "MANCHESTER UNITED 3-0 WEST HAM UNITED: Rasmus Hojlund kept up his scoring run as he netted the opener to ensure the Red Devils secured successive wins this week with Alejandro Garnacho grabbing a second-half double",
      "Manchester United closed the gap on the top five with a win over West Ham United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Hammers headed to the north west having gone unbeaten in six Premier League games, which included a win over the Red Devils back in December. Six weeks on from that result and United gained revenge with Rasmus Hojlund keeping up his impressive form.",
      "The Dane continues to be in the goals, dropping the shoulder to fire home the opener in what was an underwhelming first-half for the hosts, who were outplayed by the visitors. West Ham were unable to take their chances though and were made to pay by Alejandro Garnacho, who bagged a brace.",
      "His deflected effort put United in total control early in the second-half and the Hammers couldn't find a route back into the game. Jarrod Bowen had their best opportunity, only to be denied before Garnacho put the gloss on the result with a cool finish late on. The three points allowed them to close on Tottenham, whose fifth spot could yet mean Champions League football this term.",
      "These are the talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "United's £72million summer signing was beginning to be mocked as his Premier League goal tally remain at zero on Christmas Day, months into his career at Old Trafford. The raw forward had showcased his quality in Europe and, despite failing to fire in the league, it was always a case of when, rather than if.",
      "Hojlund bagged his first in the Boxing Day win over Aston Villa and the floodgates have since opened with the confidence flowing through him. The Dane's strike against the Hammers was that of a man who had total belief in his own ability.",
      "A number of his attacking colleagues have copped flack for failing to deliver this season, but Hojlund always showed enough to warrant patience and he's more than paying back that faith now, scoring in his last four league outings.",
      "Few things can be more frustrating than seeing your side impose themselves as an away outfit, only to get back on the bus with no points. That will be Moyes this evening with West Ham certainly showing why they've enjoyed such lofty heights this term.",
      "In the opening exchanges they showed ambition and were, for large parts, better than United, but simply couldn't take their opportunities. West Ham went into half-time enjoying the better of every stat, except the one that mattered.",
      "Harry Maguire presented Emerson with a golden opportunity to level early in the second-half, which he blazed over. Within 60 seconds United had doubled their lead thanks to a deflected Garnacho strike, all but killing West Ham's hopes.",
      "Youth has often provided a beacon of hope for those at United, even during the difficult times. Garnacho is among those to show he has the appetite to succeed at one of the world's biggest clubs and his strike made it 2-0 after 49 minutes as he reeled away in celebration.",
      "He was followed by Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo, the scorer of the winner against Wolves in midweek. The trio posed on the advertising boards with Old Trafford on its feet. They could prove to be three of the most crucial cogs at United for the next decade and beyond as they sat smiling cheek to cheek. Aged just 18, 19 and 21 - the future looks bright with those youngsters firing.",
      "It was all looking so good for the World Cup winner. Say what you want about the Argentine's size, but the bottomline is he's returned from a lengthy injury lay off and helped United win two games in the space of four days - something they've not achieved that often this season. He's slotted straight into the backline, forming a partnership with Maguire, whom he'd have hardly played with last term.",
      "However Martinez landed awkwardly when he was involved in a scuffle as he tried to usher the ball out of play. He went down clutching his knee with team-mates rushing over to check on him. Despite efforts to run it off the centre-half trudged off on 70 minutes with the look of a man who wasn't entirely convinced with the state of his fitness.",
      "Whenever Moyes returns to Old Trafford he must walk past the home dugout and wonder what might've been had he done things differently. As an away manager though he's still awaiting his first win in almost twenty visits.",
      "He was present for some landmark draws, particularly the 4-4 when he was manager of Everton that cost United the title in 2012. Wins though have eluded him with his Hammers side unable to press home a 1-0 advantage last term in the FA Cup. This season he'll have been buoyed by their performance, particularly in the first-half, but remains winless at a visiting manager to the red half of Manchester."

      "Manchester United were forced into signing Sofyan Amrabat in the summer according to Gary Neville.",
      "The midfielder arrived at Old Trafford on transfer deadline day in September as they looked to strengthen Erik ten Hag's hand. The Morocco international joined on an £8.5million loan, with the Red Devils holding an option to make the deal permanent for £21.4m.",
      "The 27-year-old has made 17 United appearances this term and returned to Ten Hag's squad for the clash with Manchester United after a stint at the Africa Cup of Nations. His time away has seen young midfielder Kobbie Mainoo continue his rise to prominence however.",
      "The 18-year-old scored his first goal for the club against Newport in the FA Cup, quickly followed by an impressive Premier League winner against Wolves to earn United three points. Mainoo's reputation is quickly growing and he has established himself as a regular in Ten Hag's midfield while Amrabat has been absent.",
      "Former Man United defender Neville revealed that Mainoo's talent was appreciated much earlier at the club however. The pundit suggested that an injury to the teenager was the only reason United decided to make the move to land Ambrabat from Fiorentina.",
      "He said: \"To be fair to Ten Hag, I made the inquiry in the transfer window over the summer about whether they needed another central midfielder. Amrabat was linked with them at the time but they’ve said that if Mainoo hadn’t been injured, they’d have not brought anyone in.",
      "\"Because he did go down, Amrabat came in but the faith was there in him from the start. He’s proven already that he’s got the quality as well as the temperament to play in these big matches, he’s a real star.\"",
      "Mainoo has wasted little time in convincing those less familiar of him with his talent too. Rasmus Hojlund arrived in the summer in a £72m deal and was quickly told about the midfielder that was leaving tongues wagging.",
      "Following Mainoo's match-winning goal in midweek, Hojlund said: \"I didn’t get to see him in pre-season because I wasn’t there. But all of the lads were talking about him and saying he is a generational talent. He has a nice body type, he is very mature and has a good personality as well.",
      "\"He’s very calm, and outside the pitch he’s a nice, relaxed guy. You can see he’s composed and shows his quality, and he showed it again tonight - he’s an incredible talent. He’s only 18-years-old, and I thought I was young.\""

Hojlund, who'd scored to make it 1-0 to the home side in the 23rd minute, was defending a corner shortly after and poked Zouma in the eye. United supporters in the Stretford End were heard chanting when Zouma was down: \"That's how your cat feels!\"",
      "The 29-year-old former Chelsea and Stoke defender was sentenced to 180 hours' worth of community service after pleading guilty to kicking and slapping the cat. Zouma regularly takes stick from supporters of other clubs and social media users often enjoy making a dig at him.",
      "One posted during Sunday's match: \"Zouma has gone down like a cat being punched in the face by a professional athlete.\" Another added: \"Wonder if the cat he kicked went down as easy as him after a finger in the face.\"",
      "Zouma expressed his \"great remorse\" over the much-criticised incent during an interview in 2022, telling West Ham's website: \"It's been a difficult spell for me and my family.

      "\"I have great remorse about it and now I’m trying to move on with my family and looking ahead. I learned from it, that's the most important thing, I would say. Obviously, I had support from many, many people around me who helped me stay focused on football and I try to stay happy.",

      "His brother, Yoan - who admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence - was ordered to carry out 140 hours' worth of community service.

      "Kobbie Mainoo's dramatic, injury-time, winner at Wolves kept United in touching distance of the top six after an extremely patchy opening half to the Premier League season. And the memorable 4-3 victory at Molineux has sparked hopes that Erik ten Hag's side could put a run of form together between now and May.",
      "At the start of the campaign there was a thought that United could insert themselves into the title picture, having finished third and reached two cup finals in Ten Hag's maiden season in charge. But after suffering nine defeats in their opening 22 matches, they are already a distant 11 points off the top four, albeit with a game in hand.",
      "Speaking ahead of the clash with West Ham at Old Trafford, the two Red Devils legends both suggested that a top-four spot was all but out of reach. Finishing fifth could be enough for the Champions League this season, and Keane and Neville agree that should be the overall target for the season.",
      "Keane said: \"A positive end for them this season would be finishing fifth and getting back into the Champions League if that’d be enough for them to do so.",

      "Getafe manager Jose Bordalas has described Manchester United loanee Mason Greenwood as \"a great guy\" who shows \"exemplary behaviour.\"",

In February 2023, Greenwood had charges of attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "An expert lip-reader believes that Bellingham did indeed make the slur at Greenwood, who's also had chants involving the word 'die' aimed towards him this season by various groups of opposition supporters. La Liga have now launched an investigation after Getafe complained and boss Bordalas has defended the forward, who'll remain with the Spanish club until the end of this season.",
      "\"I know the same thing that you know,\" Bordalos told a press conference. \"It's not up to me, it's the club, La Liga and the (Spanish Football) Federation (RFEF) that have to make an assessment about it. The only thing that I can say is that I ask for respect for Mason Greenwood because he is a great guy. He is a man who respects everyone and has exemplary behaviour.\"",
      "After Bellingham's alleged slur had gone viral on social media, Getafe - who are also based in Madrid - asked referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea to note the allegation in his match report. The 20-year-old, who cost Real £88million to sign from Borussia Dortmund and is expected to be one of England's most important players at the European Championships this summer, could be subject to a disciplinary case led by the RFEF.",

The United academy graduate has scored four goals and provided four assists across 18 La Liga appearances this season, prompting speculation over a big-money transfer move.",

It takes more work than talent. We were confident because of the talent, because of the level he has had.",

We are happy and content because we have a great player, he is a good boy, he has fitted in really well and he just needs to learn a little more Spanish.\""

      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford's long-term future at the club is once again being questioned, as the fallout from his boozy night in Belfast last week continues",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has urged Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag to take a leaf out of the late Gerard Houllier's book.",
      "Houllier, while in charge of Liverpool, instilled discipline into both Murphy and his team-mate, Steven Gerrard, as they broke into the Reds' first-team during the late 1990s. Ten Hag has a similar task when it comes to United star Marcus Rashford, who last Sunday was ordered to stay in Manchester ahead of his side's FA Cup clash with Newport County - which his team-mates won 4-2 - after enjoying a boozy night out in Belfast which resulted in him missing a day's training.",
      "Rashford returned to United's squad on Thursday for their trip to Wolves and took just five minutes to score in their dramatic 4-3 win. But long-term questions still loom over the forward's future, despite being one of the club's most senior players and 26 years old, as French giants Paris Saint-Germain are, once again, being linked with a transfer.",
      "Murphy has recalled a tale from his early days at Liverpool when boss Houllier, who died aged 73 in December 2020, took contrasting approaches when dealing with him and Gerrard, who'd go to become one of the Reds' all-time greats. \"Getting the best out of players requires a manager imposing discipline but also having a softer side,\" Murphy wrote in his Mail on Sunday column.",
      "\"Players need to know that there are consequences for poor performances or bad attitudes. Sometimes younger players don't want to listen to anyone so the manager has to make them feel it. It happened to me when Houllier bombed me out back on loan to Crewe because I thought I was God's gift signing for Liverpool.\"",
      "As the ex- Charlton, Tottenham and Fulham man explains, though, Houllier's treatment of Gerrard was vastly different. \"I know he took Stevie and his parents to dinner and warned them he wouldn't make it at the club without becoming more professional,\" Murphy said.",
      "\"It bucked him up fast. But there has to be a carrot as well as a stick. Players respond to managers who show a genuine interest in their welfare.",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United consider selling Marcus Rashford? Give us your stance in the comments section.",
      "\"At United, Rashford has to feel engaged with his manager. He has to believe despite any criticism, the manager has his players' backs. Otherwise there is a problem. Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola are masters at it. You can see them chatting to and embracing their players with real warmth. At the same time, you know not to mess with them. It's a difficult balancing act but possible.\"",
      "With the Belfast incident now a \"closed\" matter, Rashford is also expected to face West Ham on Sunday when United welcome the Irons to Old Trafford. Ten Hag was pleased with the England international's display at Wolves but made sure to point out his team-mates' role in the opening goal."

      "The 15th annual FootballvHomophobia Month of Action will take place over February, with the events being capped off by an awards ceremony where Manchester United and Arsenal have both been shortlisted",
      "Campaign group FootballvHomophobia have issued a rallying cry as they prepare to launch their 15th Month of Action.",
      "The group works to stamp out homophobic abuse from the beautiful game, though campaign lead Lou Englefield has admitted she has seen a lurch back into \"divisive times\". Despite seeing the likes of Jake Daniels and Josh Cavallo come out, football has struggled to make the LGBT+ community feel welcome.",
      "FootballvHomophobia have been working to change that, with their programme centred around education. The focal point of their year is the Month of Action, which traditionally runs over February in recognition of Justin Fashanu's birthday.",
      "Fashanu was the first British footballer to come out as gay back in 1990. But Englefield believes there is still more work to do on LGBT+ inclusion despite the progress that has been made in the 34 years since Fashanu's coming out.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Mirror Football, she said: \"The month of action is not just 'we do something for a month, then don't talk about homophobia again'. It's just a way we can bring football together and make a big noise. That helps to amplify what we do year round.",
      "\"On one hand, we've seen some incredible changes, in the UK particularly. When we first started, there no LGBT fan groups, so no visible presence of LGBT people in stadia. One of the reasons the Justin Campaign launched FootballvHomophobia was to start conversations.",
      "\"Now, we've got nearly 60 LGBT+ fan groups, we've got huge visibility in the game. I had half an eye on a game the other night at Spurs and there was the enormous Proud Lilywhites flag in the corner of the pitch and that's amazing to see.",
      "\"It's more commonplace now, but 14 years ago we could never have imagined that kind of recognition that LGBT+ people belong in football and we have a place in the game. So yes football has changed hugely and really, really positively.",
      "\"But then at the same time, we now find ourselves in very divisive times. We're seeing a huge increase in homophobia. During the Women's World Cup, homophobic abuse was the largest form of online abuse targeting footballers and that's a disgrace. So a real mixed bag.\"",
      "As well as creating an 'Allies United' education programme and a new membership scheme for professional clubs, the month will see the FvH Awards ceremony. Manchester United and Arsenal have both been nominated in the 'Professional Clubs' category.",
      "The Premier League duo will go head to head on 23 February at the ceremony at the National Football Museum. And Englefield believes it is crucial to celebrate the achievements of those working for LGBT+ equality in football.",
      "\"The reason we launched the awards, we were looking back on the past, we saw huge change in football and thought 'what do we need to do to acknowledge the great work that's been happening',\" she added.",
      "\"So we launched the awards as a way of acknowledging the good work that was already there. One of the things I would say is many of the clubs that are getting nominated for awards are doing that work already.",
      "\"I don't think anybody's doing the work to win an FvH Award, as prestigious as I like to think they are, but I do think it's really important to acknowledge good work where we see it. It's a really lovely celebration of what is good in the industry.\"",
      "The month of action comes a few months after Stonewall's annual Rainbow Laces initiative. But despite some haters asking why the fight for LGBT+ equality needs two periods of action, Englefield is adamant both campaigns are important.",
      "\"On one hand I understand some of the frustration, we don't want to constantly bombard people. Really, the reality is clubs will use both campaigns to send out different messages,\" she said.",
      "\"Some clubs will buy into both. There are undoubtedly professional clubs who want to take part in both events. For other clubs, they want to do Rainbow Laces, others want to do the Month of Action.",
      "\"For us, FootballvHomophobia has been around for 15 seasons and I think we're here working year round, we're very education focused, so there are different opportunities for clubs with both of those campaigns.\""

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been a shining light during a disappointing season for Manchester United so far and Ghana now want to secure the international services of the midfielder",
      "Ghana are trying to convince Kobbie Mainoo to snub England and represent the African nation after impressing in his breakthrough Manchester United campaign.",
      "The 18-year-old, who joined the club's academy almost a decade ago, signed his first professional contract in May 2022 and made his senior debut last January in the Carabao Cup against Charlton. Mainoo was handed his first Premier League start as United ran out 3-0 winners against Everton in November.",
      "He has since become an important member of Erik ten Hag's first-team squad, starting the last eight matches, including Thursday's 4-3 victory at Wolves, where Mainoo produced a moment of magic to score a 97th-minute winner, as his low drive found the corner for his second goal in four days.",
      "Mainoo has been described as a \"generational talent\" by team-mate Rasmus Hojlund and his progression has not gone unnoticed in Ghana, who are attempting to persuade him to switch allegiances. Born in Stockport, Mainoo has represented England at three different age groups but his parents are of Ghanaian heritage.",
      "Speaking to The Times, Randy Abbey, who is a member of the executive council of the Ghana FA, said: \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents, and the association would love to work with him and many like him at home and abroad.\"",
      "Ghana endured a disastrous Africa Cup of Nations campaign and crashed out at the first hurdle after failing to qualify from their group. Having lost their first game against Cape Verde, Ghana were held to a 2-2 draw by Egypt before falling apart in their final group match against Mozambique.",
      "The Black Stars were on the verge of progressing to the last 16 after racing into a two-goal lead thanks to Jordan Ayew's brace. However, Mozambique scored twice in stoppage-time to leave Ghana third and needing other results to go their way. Unfortunately for Ghana, they finished outside the four best third-place teams and suffered an early exit from a tournament they last won back in 1982.",
      "As for Mainoo, the teenage sensational has already been linked with a shock call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad ahead of Euro 2024. Mainoo is yet to earn his first England cap but he could be in contention for the next Three Lions squad as they prepare to face Brazil and Belgium in March.",
      "\"It is a dream come true,\" Mainoo said after netting his first Premier League goal on Thursday. \"I have still not come down from it. I still feel like I am dreaming to be honest. To start playing in the Premier League for my boyhood club has been amazing. Now it's about trying to win more games.\""

      "ROBBIE FOWLER COLUMN: The biggest issue Marcus Rashford has got as he tries to shake off the fall-out from an ill-advised bender in Belfast is that United are no longer winning trophies regularly",
      "In the days when Manchester United were winning Premier League titles and Champions Leagues, I would often see their players out on the town in a bar or nightclub.",
      "The biggest issue Marcus Rashford has got as he tries to shake off the fall-out from an ill-advised bender in Belfast is that United are no longer winning trophies regularly.",
      "‌It's so true that history is written by the victor. When United beat my Liverpool team in the 1996 FA Cup final to complete the Double, it meant they would forever be remembered as one of English football's great teams. And rightly so.",
      "‌But while United were dubbed the Class of '92, we were ridiculed as the Spice Boys. United were seen as the real deal while Roy Evans' young Liverpool team were written off as a bunch of wasters with more style than substance.",
      "‌I've got to admit, walking out at Wembley in those infamous white suits wasn't the best idea! But that fashion faux pas didn't cost us the game. We were a top team, always professional. But United always seemed to be that little bit better. It hurts, but it's the truth.",
      "‌I don't know the full details of the booze-up that prompted a pile on to trash Rashford during the week. But what I am sure of is that if United were smashing it on the pitch then the fake outrage would have died a death pretty quickly.",
      "Everyone is looking for reasons why United are not the force they once were. Rashford does have to share some of the blame for that - but only because his form has been so patchy this season.",
      "‌Marcus will know if he made a mistake - but he responded in the right way by crowning a much better performance with a goal in the 4-3 win at Wolves on Thursday night.",
      "‌I understand the pressure of playing for your hometown club - and when you represent Liverpool or Manchester United the hype and expectation becomes an even bigger burden.",
      "‌The pitfalls are everywhere these days because everyone has a camera phone and social media account. But even though I played in an era where you didn't have to try to buy some privacy in a ridiculously priced restaurant or bar, you still had to tread carefully because a news journalist was only a phone call away.",
      "‌When I was making a name for myself at Anfield, playing alongside my mate Steve McManaman, we agreed to do an interview with a magazine. We both thought it had gone well. The journalist then excused himself to go to the loo - but sneakily left his tape recorder running.",
      "‌When the subsequent article appeared in print, it was all about what me and Steve had said to each other while the reporter wasn't even in the room. We were inexperienced kids during an era when media training was not part of an academy's education programme - but boy did we learn a lesson.",
      "‌I was always selective with the people I trusted. But I gradually became suspicious to the point of being paranoid. My best mate, Stephen Calvey, worked on a building site. I wanted to be one of the lads like he was, but playing football for Liverpool made that impossible.",
      "‌Stephen's restoration firm is now flourishing - but I'd like to thank him for helping to make sure I always remained grounded. Another thing I struggled with was being held up as a role model.",
      "‌I'm not condoning bad behaviour, but making mistakes is part of the process of growing up - whether you play centre-forward for Liverpool or own a building firm.",
      "Some people naturally grow into becoming a role model - and of course, Marcus' life changed when he led a campaign to force the government to change its policy over free school meals.‌",
      "I have nothing but admiration for the stance he took, but it meant that even people who don’t like football suddenly had an opinion about him. One misguided night out is all it’s taken for Saint Marcus to become Rashford the Sinner. Talk about angels and demons.",
      "I do like the fact that Manchester United said they would deal with the matter internally and I'm sure that Rashford himself will be grateful that Erik ten Hag didn’t throw him to the wolves.",
      "Everyone makes mistakes. But the next time you see players covering their mouths on TV because they worried how their words in the heat of battle may be misconstrued, understand why.",
      "I don't agree that the manager who takes over from Jurgen Klopp will be accepting a poisoned chalice. In fact, I think Livepool's next boss will have reasons to be cheerful about the legacy Klopp will leave behind.",
      "Conor Bradley is the latest youngster to illustrate what a brilliant job Alex Inglethope and his staff at the club's academy is doing to produce players who are good enough to wear the famous red shirt.",
      "I was thrilled to see the 20-year-old Northern Irishman score his first senior goal in the midweek victory over Chelsea after recently being given his big chance by the manager. But there are loads of them.",
      "Curtis Jones has become a mainstay of the team this season and is staking a place for England's squad for the Euros with performances that make a mockery of the fact he's only 23.",
      "‌He is playing as well as anyone in the country in that position and I think there is a real chance of him making the plane for Germany. Jarrell Quansah, Bobby Clark, Owen Beck, James McConnell and Luke Chambers have all broken through this season after graduating from Kirkby.",
      "‌Throw in young signings like Harvey Elliott, Stefan Bajcetic, Ben Doak, Kaide Gordon and Callum Scanlon - and even Ryan Gravenberch and it’s clear that Liverpool's future is bright.",
      "‌Usually, when a manager exits a club they leave behind a team that is struggling. Rarely does the next incumbent inherit a squad that is geared for success. It illustrates the kind of manager Klopp is that he has not turned a blind eye to bringing through the next generation.",
      "‌It would have been easy for him, knowing this was his final season at Liverpool, to rely on the same select group of experienced players who he knows won't let him down.",
      "‌Klopp might still walk away with a quadruple, of course, but whatever happens between now and May what is certain is that the next manager will also reap the benefits of his labours.",
      "It has got to a point where lads like Jones and Bradley are in the team not because of injuries, but because their performances deserve it. They are making themselves undroppable. These are huge calls for any manager to make.",
      "But those lads now know the manager trusts them in the biggest games, You can't measure what that backing does for their confidence and long-term development. Jurgen Klopp may be leaving at the end of the season, but his influence on Liverpool's team could last for years.",
      "Arsenal's Premier League title ambitions face an acid test against Liverpool. That's the brutal reality of the clash-of-the-weekend at the Emirates because a defeat would see them trailing Jurgen Klopp's team by eight points.",
      "‌I just don't think the Gunners would be capable of closing that gap, even with 15 games of the season remaining. Mikel Arteta won't be viewing the game like that. He will be telling his players that a victory will take Arsenal to within two points of the leaders - and that will then put the pressure on Liverpool.",
      "It used to be the case that title-deciding games came around in April or May. Not any longer. Liverpool can't win the title this weekend, but they can certainly deliver a devastating blow to Arsenal's hopes.",
      "‌If the Merseysiders prevail then my belief is that only Manchester City will be capable of stopping Klopp from departing the Premier League as a champion."

      "As Sir Alex Ferguson won more and more trophies at Manchester United, the story about him being one defeat from the sack back in 1990 grew legs, but the man who had the power to hand the Scot his P45 has revealed that was never the case.",
      "The story goes that United's form in the 1989-90 season left Ferguson under pressure around the turn of the year. Eight winless games put extra strain on the FA Cup third-round meeting with Nottingham Forest, with defeat potentially the final straw for the manager.",
      "Mark Robins scored the winner, supposedly saving the boss, and United ended the season as cup winners. The rest was history, so they say.",
      "Except there's one small problem. United chairman Martin Edwards would have been the man tasked with sacking Ferguson if his team lost to Forest, and Edwards himself has explained that was never on the cards.",
      "“I spoke to him in the week leading up to the Forest game, and said that if we did lose, it wasn’t going to result in the sack,\" Edwards told FourFourTwo. “I wanted to give him that comfort before the game.",
      "“Coming second flattered us in 1988 – the team needed strengthening and probably his management helped us get to that position, but we weren’t good enough to win the title. “We were patient, particularly during 1989-90, because we’d bought five players and had to give them time to gel.",
      "“He’d revamped the whole scouting system and we could see the work going on with the youth team, so we felt it was worth supporting. We had faith that success would arrive, but I’m glad it arrived when it did because we were coming under pressure from fans and everyone else.\"",
      "United didn't immediately recover in the league. Indeed, they lost their next two to leave relegation as a distinct possibility, but seven wins from the final 14 games led them to the relative comfort of 13th place.",
      "The momentum came from the cup run, though. After away wins against Hereford, Newcastle and Sheffield United, Ferguson's team needed replays in both the semis and the final to bring their manager his first silverware in English football.",
      "There was steady improvement over the next two seasons, too. Sixth place and a Cup Winners' Cup win in 1990-91, second place and a League Cup win the following year, and then the first of Ferguson's 13 Premier League titles in 1993.",
      "Ferguson also poured cold water on the suggestions he was one game for dismissal, sharing his recollection ahead of a meeting with a Barnsley side managed by Robins in 2009. \"The goal at Forest was an important goal, don’t get me wrong, and who's to say what would have happened without it, but I don’t think it saved my job,\" he said.",
      "\"You never know in football. Who's to say how the club would have reacted if we'd lost and if crowds had tumbled? Although it was unusual for United crowds to do that. One thing's for sure though - Bobby Charlton would not have let it [my sacking] happen. He knows better than anyone the heartbeat of this football club.",

      "Alonso, 42, has been touted as a replacement for Jurgen Klopp when the German ends his nine-year spell at Anfield at the end of the season. Spain international Alonso spent several years on Liverpool's books as a player, winning the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the final of the same competition two years later.",
      "As revealed by Mirror Football, Ten Hag's long-term future as United boss could hinge on how much money he is given to spend in the summer. United made no new additions in January, with Ten Hag indicating Financial Fair Play concerns prevented him from bringing in the new striker he wanted.",
      "Ten Hag has never managed in the Bundesliga before, but he developed an affinity for the league during his time in charge of Bayern Munich's second string. The manager was born in the east of the Netherlands, near the border with Germany, and still owns a house near the border.",
      "\"It's not a secret that I wanted a striker extra,\" Ten Hag said in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's home meeting with West Ham. \"Because with the injury of [Anthony] Martial, we don't really have back-up there, but it was not possible because we have to match the Financial Fair Play rules.",
      "\"We have Omari (Forson), we have Amad Diallo, of course, we have Rashford who can play there. I think for the rest, all the positions are occupied. But, yeah, we have to be a little bit creative if it's up to the number nine position.\"",

      "Alonso doesn't appear to have let the Liverpool talk distract him from the task at hand. Leverkusen claimed a 2-0 victory at Darmstadt to remain two points clear of their closest title challengers Bayern Munich ahead of their meeting next Saturday, with Nathan Tella scoring both goals.",
      "\"Bayern is always Bayern, so to beat them you have to beat them not once, [but] twice or three times,\" Alonso said. \"But before that we have the Pokal game [against Stuttgart on Tuesday] that is a big one for us We want to keep going - let's see how far, but we don't want to stop.\"",
      "Bayern were given a fright in their own Saturday fixture at home to Borussia Monchengladbach, but eventually claimed all three points. Nico Elvedi put Gladbach in front, only for Aleksandar Pavlovic to equalise just before half-time, with second-half goals from Harry Kane and Matthijs de Ligt giving Bayern victory."

      "Man United have won their last three games and scored 11 goals with their youngest starters at the forefront of their form.",
      "Erik ten Hag believes Manchester United are starting to fulfil their potential with a fuller squad available.",
      "United have won all three games since a 13-day winter break, scoring 11 goals against Newport County, Wolves and West Ham.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has been on target in all three triumphs, Alejandro Garnacho took his tally for the season to seven against West Ham while Kobbie Mainoo netted his first two goals for the club at Newport and Wolves.",
      "The three youngsters came together for a celebratory pose to mark Garnacho's first goal in the 3-0 defeat of West Ham, sitting together on the Old Trafford advertising hoarding. Garnacho mimicked West Ham winger Mohammed Kudus's celebration and described it as an \"inspiration\".",
      "Garnacho has started the past 18 games while Mainoo has lined up in 11 of the last 15 games since he returned from injury. The midfielder suffered an ankle injury in United's second pre-season tour match against Real Madrid in July that sidelined Mainoo for four months.",
      "\"I have to analyse, clinical, calm,\" Ten Hag explained of United's mini resurgence. \"So we now have a team that is in balance on the pitch. We can play better, also you see the progress is coming.",
      "\"We bought players in the summer for the future, we also made choices to give players who deserve it, to give opportunities in the first team such as Garnacho and Mainoo.",
      "\"Mainoo in the second game against Madrid gets a real bad injury. Then the plans you have, you have to adapt. Hojlund had a period, he came late in, young, but you see he is progressing.",
      "\"When there is a consistent team in his back with routines, they will serve him better and you see a frontline in balance. It is a threat for every opponent and also you see they enjoy it, to play football, they enjoy it, to give opponents problems, they want to do the togetherness.",
      "\"The picture covered a lot, I think, of the three youngsters celebrating together. It's not about one player, it's about a team. That's what I have seen today. It looked like a team. 11 defending, 11 attacking. For me, it was enjoyable to watch.",
      "\"That was our plan before the season because we saw the potential from those players. They need games, they need experience and the only way you get this is to play in the first team, to get the opposition, then adapt and have the right attitude and they keep doing this in togetherness and the attitude to improve every day. Then I am convinced they can achieve very high levels.",
      "\"But they need experienced players, who've achieved everything to help them, to put them in the right positions. Right moment and right attitude.\"",

      "Man Utd secured their easiest home win of the season in the Premier League as they beat West Ham 3-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "A clinical touch",
      "On the balance of play it's fair to say Manchester United didn't deserve to win this game 3-0. But for the first time this season, they are starting to show the clinical edge that can sometimes mark out the very best sides.",
      "West Ham had almost twice as many shots as United and some very good chances, but they weren't efficient in front of goal and Erik ten Hag's side were. It's a ruthless side of the game we haven't seen enough this season but which is beginning to come to the fore at a valuable point of the campaign.",
      "United have scored 15 goals in their last five games and although two of those were against teams from League One and League Two, they also scored twice against Tottenham, four times at Wolves and now three against West Ham.",
      "The finishes produced by Rasmus Hojlund for the first and Alejandro Garnacho for the third showed how important players who can put chances away are. Maybe it's a learning curve for young players, but this side were guilty of missing too many chances earlier in the season. Now they are capitalising more often than not.",
      "Hojlund is leading that change. His goal to open the scoring on Sunday came out of nothing. He worked the space for himself and finished brilliantly. It set an example that Garnacho followed and although this wasn't a brilliant United performance the scoreline was convincing, which has rarely been the case this season.",
      "On countless occasions this season Ten Hag has complained about the lack of a clinical edge in his team. He even did so after the draw against Tottenham last month. He told his team they \"weren't clinical enough\" after the 3-3 draw with Galatasaray in Istanbul that all but ended their Champions League campaign. Finally, it looks like the message is getting through.",
      "Martinez concerns",
      "There were shades of Virgil van Dijk's defending against Moussa Sissoko with the way Lisandro Martinez saw off a dangerous West Ham counter early in the second half. In 2019 Van Dijk was lauded for allowing Sissoko to shoot and instead blocking off the pass to Son Heung-min, who was clearly the more dangerous player.",
      "Martinez did exactly the same here and although he didn't touch the ball, he knew how decisive his decision-making had been when he turned to the crowd to celebrate. It was Emerson Palmieri with the chance, seizing on a loose touch from Harry Maguire to race clear in a two-on-one.",
      "But Martinez blocked the square pass to Jarrod Bowen and forced Emerson to go on his own. His finish was befitting of a full-back who had clearly been desperate to pass.",
      "Martinez's absence has perhaps been the most important of all for United this season, so the sight of him hobbling off in the second half left a cloud over the victory. Ten Hag's post-match diagnosis didn't sound at all encouraging.",
      "Casemiro's contribution",
      "Hojlund will rightly take the plaudits for the brilliance of the goal that gave United the lead, but it wouldn't have been possible without the aggressive, instinctive play that Casemiro displayed throughout last season.",
      "The Brazilian has been a disappointment this season but since returning from an ankle injury he's shown signs of rediscovering his best form. He played a key role in the opener. He looked second favourite to reach the loose ball from Kurt Zouma's clearing header but read the game well and showed good strength to get in front of James Ward-Prowse and beat Tomas Soucek to the ball.",
      "Casemiro made up 10 yards in very little time to slide in and touch the ball to Hojlund. And although what followed was all down to the Dane, the contribution of United's holding midfielder shouldn't be overlooked given it felt like the kind of thing he wasn't doing enough of in the first few months of the season.",
      "Mainoo v Phillips",
      "Kalvin Phillips made the move from Manchester City to West Ham to play the regular football he needs to cement his place in England's Euro 2024 squad, so with Gareth Southgate's assistant Steve Holland watching on at Old Trafford, the midfielder would have been disappointed to have been dropped after one game by his new club.",
      "Phillips gave away the penalty from which Bournemouth scored in midweek and was immediately benched by David Moyes. As a former Leeds and current City player, he had to warm-up in front of the Stretford End, which went as you would expect it to.",
      "It's been a tricky 18 months or so for Phillips since leaving his boyhood club and he was never fancied by Pep Guardiola at the Etihad. He has been a favourite of Southgate's, but his place in the England squad must be under pressure. Several youngsters are making a push for the squad and 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo has to be at the forefront. He is now just 16 games into his senior club career but must be on Southgate's radar, especially with Ghana trying to convince the Stockport-born midfielder to represent the country of his parents.",
      "Maguire's return",
      "Raphael Varane's fitness record speaks for itself at United and in a way the World Cup winner had a good run starting six successive games without picking up another issue, before being benched against West Ham.",
      "That was his longest run of starts in a row in two years and shows how badly injuries have affected his time at the club and his ability to string a run of games together. He remains a superb centre-back, but he struggles to play twice a week, has already retired from international duty and has gone public with his complaints about the schedule.",
      "He is going to need to be rested every now and again and with Maguire back fit it made sense to rotate here, especially given Varane had played at Wolves on Thursday night. Maguire's form this season has warranted more starts.",
      "He defended well against the Hammers in the first half. He read the game superbly early on to get to the ball ahead of Bowen and then made a superb tackle later to block Mohammed Kudus, when he was about to play Ben Johnson into acres of space down the right.",
      "There were a couple of shaky moments after the break, gifting a big chance to Emerson Palmieri at 1-0 and then allowing a ball to go over his head to let Bowen in at 2-0. He got away with both, however, and that is maybe the difference for Maguire at the moment.",

After Garnacho had scored the second of the afternoon against West Ham, the 18-year-old, 19-year-old and 21-year-old had been responsible for United's last three goals in less than an hour of football. Just for good measure, Garnacho added a third on the day.",
      "It was an image to the promise of youth. Mainoo was the hero at Molineux on Thursday night, Hojlund is the birthday boy who is showing the value of confidence and Garnacho the one who looks like a star, a flying winger in the mould of so many before him at Old Trafford.",
      "After the thrilling finale at Wolves in the week, Hojlund spoke about wanting to define an era with the other young players at the club. In a season that has proven to be more difficult than anyone expected, it is the spirit of youth that has given United some hope and it is a cohort being led by the Mancunian, the Dane and the Argentine.",
      "There was an almost inevitable lull for Mainoo after his heroics of the previous week. He was solid again without the spectacular contributions he carved out against Newport and Wolves. But he is undoubtedly a fixture in this side now despite his tender years. This was his ninth start in a row.",
      "Garnacho is on double that and after 18 successive starts, his reputation as a thrilling forward only capable of influencing games off the bench is a thing of the past. He is thriving on the right and although he wasn't at his best in the first half against West Ham, he worked space well for his first goal after the break and the finish for his second was calmly done. He is becoming a more consistent threat.",
      "But it was Hojlund who set the tone for this win on the day he celebrated his 21st birthday. It's just under six weeks since the cathartic release of his first Premier League goal on Boxing Day and that really was the start of something. He can't stop scoring now.",
      "His goal on Thursday night showed the instincts of a penalty box predator, bundling the ball home by any means possible, but in his short United career, he has already shown an eye for the spectacular as well. His 10th goal of the season in all competitions fit that description.",
      "He picked up Casemiro's interception 22 yards from goal, threatened to go on his left, chopped inside Nayef Aguerd onto his weaker foot and struck a rasping low drive into the bottom corner. It was a slick bit of play, much slicker than the unsteady celebration that followed, although by full-time it wasn't the celebration United fans were talking about.",
      "It was a key goal, however. West Ham were the better side in the first half and United barely threatened. By full-time the Hammers had racked up 21 shots to United's 12 and would have been wondering how they had lost the game so convincingly. The infectious enthusiasm of youth was one reason.",
      "Hojlund gave United a lead they scarcely deserved but badly needed and Garnacho sealed the deal. They built on the momentum Mainoo had handed them on Thursday night. As a performance, this wasn't as good as that glimpsed at Molineux. But it was another victory delivered by the youngsters who might just be good enough to define an era at Old Trafford.",

      "Martinez returned from a four-month lay-off with a foot injury against Tottenham three weeks ago and he started in United's recent wins at Newport County and Wolves.",
      "The 26-year-old sustained a metatarsal injury in the Europa League quarter-final first leg draw with Sevilla in April that ended his first season at United early. He required a second round of surgery in September.",
      "Martinez's injury blemished one of the most comfortable afternoons of United's season as they won by a three-goal margin for the first time in a home league game since May.",
      "Ten Hag is not getting carried away, though. \"It's only one game, so don't celebrate this too much. We don't have reasons in this moment to do it but for today we are pleased with it.",
      "\"But you need routines to get consistent performances. So you have to make decisions in a split second and when every time you have to swap your team, you have to swap your centre halves, swap your back four, positioning the right full-back to the left full-back and swap back again, and all those adjustments, all those rules and principles.",
      "\"It's about looking at each other, taking the right decisions. Top football is about the right details. When detail doesn't work, you concede goals then you're following the facts and we've had that too much this season.",
      "\"I'm not telling you we are there where we want but you see the potential. But you can only work on the potential when the team is available and when certain positions are not available you have to be creative.",
      "\"We have times in the season where every time we have to adapt to put an XI out and now in this moment, we don't have. But then the injury is coming from Licha Martinez so I hope we are not going back in such a process, we want to stay away from it.",
      "\"We want to work on the team. And I know it's not about 11 players. It's about 15 or 16 players. I hope we can keep them all fit and I think then we can still achieve a lot in this season. In this Premier League, everyone is killing everyone and the process is going from final to final.\"",

      "Harry Maguire: Back in the starting XI for the first time in almost two months and produced one of his strongest performances of the season until he let Emerson Palmieri in. Did likewise for Bowen. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Different partner but same Martinez. Often the defender in the way of a pass or a shot. Had to come off after his knee buckled under the weight of Vladimir Coufal. 8",
      "Luke Shaw: Not as probing in the final third as he has been of late but defensively excellent again before and after Kudus switched to the right flank. 7",

      "Alejandro Garnacho: Pocketed by Emerson Palmieri in the first half but wriggled out of it to score early in the second, via a deflection. Then scored again to kill the game. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Drew a vigilant stop from Alphonse Areola and played the ball to Garnacho for the second goal. Could have scored himself but for an errant touch. 7",

      "United-bred duo Garnacho and Mainoo are still in their teens but Hojlund turned 21 today. His goal on Boxing Day feels like a coming of age and he now has four in his past four Premier League starts.",
      "Mainoo, substituted for the first time since December, earned a standing ovation and compliments from Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford on his way to the touchline. Erik ten Hag offered a congratulatory pat on the head.",
      "Garnacho gained a chant days after his United debut as a 17-year-old on the night of the FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022. As the frontman, Hojlund deserves a backing band and the Stockport-born Mainoo can expect to enter United's tome of a songbook soon.",
      "The youth were underpinned by the veterans. Casemiro's urgent press made Hojlund's goal possible and, bar one major lapse, Harry Maguire was commanding on his return to the starting XI for the first time in nearly eight weeks.",
      "Maguire relinquished the captain's armband six months ago but is still an authoritative figure. The applause for one interception had barely subsided and he was ushering Lisandro Martinez further forward, acknowledging his superior distribution in the middle third.",
      "When Maguire erred and let Jarrod Bowen in, Diogo Dalot rushed across to hurl his body in the way of the ball, a goal-saving block that brought United fans to their feet. The ball was still live when Maguire thanked him. Dalot has firmly cemented his status as starting right-back and, not for the first time, it has coincided with Aaron Wan-Bissaka going AWOL.",
      "United fans' chants of 'Argentina' began at the Boleyn Ground in support of David Beckham back in August 1998 and one of the loudest renditions came in response to Martinez's tangle with Vladimir Coufal. Martinez's enforced withdrawal was the only negative. Ten Hag admitted it was a \"personal disaster\".",
      "After squandering two-goal leads at Newport and Wolverhampton, there was an elusive third goal that ensured a rare day devoid of drama. United went 3-0 up for only the third time this term. The last time it happened in a home league fixture was last May.",
      "Ten Hag and one of his predecessors, David Moyes, carried the wreaths when both teams emerged from the tunnel. A besuited Moyes, with the Manchester coat of arms stitched onto his blazer, visited the Manchesterplatz site in Munich when he was United manager in 2014. Supporters present appreciated that.",
      "In West Ham colours, Moyes looked understandably disappointed by their profligacy in the first half and it continued early into the second. Emerson Palmieri seized on Maguire's hesitancy and looked to pass when he had to shoot. He only threatened those in the Scoreboard End. A minute later, Garnacho wriggled out of Palmieri's pocket and scored.",
      "There were high fives and hugs all round for Hojlund, as well as a chest bump from Maguire to mark his 23rd-minute opener. Hojlund has now broken double figures for United goals and his 10th was his most singular. The Dane has scored some great goals and his potential to be a great goalscorer is more apparent with every game.",
      "Hojlund had the confidence to deceive the West Ham defenders and switch the ball to his weaker right foot. He wellied the ball in as though it was his strongest. Whilst players joined the throng, Ten Hag had stuffed his hands back into his pockets. He is nearing vindication with the £72million striker.",
      "Steve Holland, Gareth Southgate's assistant, was in the directors' box and nattering with the United football director John Murtough before kick-off. Five England internationals started across both sides but the one Holland had to have cast his eye over carefully was Mainoo. The 18-year-old drew applause in the 21st minute for a smart shimmy that deceived Kudus before setting Garnacho on his way.",
      "Another England midfielder, Kalvin Phillips, was promptly dropped by Moyes after a chastening debut against Bournemouth in midweek. Phillips's substitute status did not spare the former Leeds and Manchester City midfielder from the Stretford End giving him grief during an early warm-up. Phillips was a good enough sport to engage in the repartee. Then he was robbed of the ball for Garnacho's second goal.",

      "Man United need to clear the decks in the 2024 summer transfer window and begin the process of trying to avoid mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe corrects just one department at Manchester United this forthcoming summer, it has to be the recruitment department.",
      "For far too long, United have been guilty of over-spending on players, courtesy of poor strategic planning and rash decision-making. As part of their minority investment at Old Trafford, INEOS have secured management of the club's football operations, meaning they will oversee all aspects of recruitment.",
      "INEOS, of course, have acted swiftly to try and lay the foundations for a brighter future on that particular front, swooping for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as the club's new CEO, from Manchester City. He has already warned about the dangers of paying over the odds for players - something United have been guilty of time after time.",
      "The £85.5million acquisition of Antony from Ajax in September 2022 is a prime example. The art of perfecting recruitment is a two-way system and United have not mastered it in recent years. They have been guilty of stock-piling players, often allowing them to run down their contracts and leave for free, or selling them for minimal fees when the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City have commanded respectable fees for their unwanted stars.",
      "Though they have played their part for United this season, the club's failure to offload both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay last summer are prime examples of their failure to trim the squad and command hefty transfer fees. United cannot afford to repeat such errors ahead of 2024/25, and it is unlikely that INEOS will allow them to.",
      "This forthcoming summer's transfer window promises to be one of the most intriguing United have faced in years. The eyes of the world will be on Old Trafford to see what impact INEOS have.",
      "If they are serious about taking United back to the top, they need to significantly improve the club's ability to trade in the transfer market. Looking ahead to the summer, the Reds have a whole host of players on their books who need moving on permanently.",
      "Focusing primarily on those who will be under contract at the beginning of next season, you can argue that a minimum of 11 players need selling, both for the benefit of the club and each individual's career. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Victor Lindelof have both had their contracts extended until June 2025, meaning United have avoided the risk of losing them for free this summer.",
      "United plan to recruit a first-choice right-back ahead of next season, meaning either Diogo Dalot or Wan-Bissaka will need moving on. Dalot has a higher ceiling, meaning it would make sense to cash in on Wan-Bissaka this summer, with the next transfer window representing United's last chance to try and secure a respectable fee for him.",
      "The same can be said for Lindelof. United want to sign a new centre-back this summer, meaning the Swede's game time could be reduced even further, resulting in his valuation dropping.",
      "Other United defenders are not safe from being sold, either. Will Fish, under contract until 2025, with the option to extend for a further year, is currently on a second loan spell at Hibernian in as many seasons, meaning, with all due respect, he is never likely to make the grade at Old Trafford and become a regular under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Brandon Williams and Alvaro Fernandez both have clauses within their contracts for additional one-year options to be triggered, meaning they could then pave the way for potential offers to come United's way, so long as suitors have already declared interest. The deal which saw Benfica sign Fernandez includes an obligation to buy if he starts 50 per cent of matches and they will pay €6m plus €3m in potential add-ons. There will still be an option to buy if the obligation isn't triggered.",
      "Hannibal Mejbri and Donny van de Beek both departed on loan last month, joining Sevilla and Eintracht Frankfurt respectively. Each deal could be made permanent.",
      "Though Hannibal offered flashes of his class earlier this term, he is unlikely to have a long-term future at Old Trafford. Van de Beek needs moving off the books as soon as possible.",
      "In forward areas, Facundo Pellistri and Jadon Sancho departed on loan in the January window, potentially ending their hopes of long-term futures in M16. Sancho had been frozen out by Ten Hag since September after a public fallout.",
      "If both players impress during their respective loans at Granada and Borussia Dortmund, this summer would represent an opportunity for United to cash in. The sales of both players would almost certainly see them record losses, though.",
      "Mason Greenwood is still under contract at Old Trafford, meaning United need to actively try and get him off the books permanently this summer. Several clubs in Spain, including current loan club Getafe, have been linked with signing him.",
      "Omari Forson may also be sold for a fee if United tie him down to a new contract. He is out-of-contract this summer, but the Reds, in the past, have tied a player down to a new deal and then sold them at the next available juncture.",

      "Here are the moments you might have missed from Man United's 3-0 win over West Ham United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Two goals from Alejandro Garnacho, both of which came in the second half, and one from Rasmus Hojlund prior to the break gave the Reds their biggest home league win of the season. United have now won each of their last two league outings, scoring seven goals in the process.",
      "Though the victory suggested United had everything their own way, West Ham had the better of the chances in the first half. They also spurned a golden opportunity to draw level moments before Garnacho made it 2-0 at the start of the second period.",
      "Nevertheless, United were full value for their victory over the course of the 90 minutes, inspired by eye-catching displays from Hojlund and Garnacho. The duo, particularly the latter, caused no shortage of problems for David Moyes' side, who had arrived at Old Trafford one point ahead of the Reds in the standings. Below, MEN Sport has highlighted some of the moments you may not have spotted from Sunday's encounter at Old Trafford.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, former United striker Robin van Persie was spotted back in familiar surroundings. The former Netherlands international spent three years in M16, scoring 58 goals in 105 appearances in all competitions between 2012 and 2015.",
      "Such was the level of success he enjoyed during his time at the club, it was hardly surprising to see so many United fans sat in front of the directors' box asking him for a picture and his autograph. Van Persie kindly agreed to those requests and spent a few moments engaging with supporters. He was also in attendance at Old Trafford for the 3-2 win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day.",
      "Though United took a slender 1-0 lead into the half-time interval, their defenders had had to deal with more than what West Ham's had in the first half. Either side of Hojlund's opener, United's back-four and keeper Andre Onana were called into action.",
      "With 35 minutes on the clock, West Ham attempted to work the ball into the left channel of the penalty area with Emerson Palmieri latching onto a clever pass from Mohammed Kudus. But before Emerson even had chance to lift his head in the hope of picking out a man in a white shirt, Lisandro Martinez was across to greet him.",
      "The Argentine arrived on the scene in the blink of an eye, making an excellent challenge to put the ball into touch. As soon as he was back on his feet, Diogo Dalot was slapping his flesh in a show of appreciation and celebration.",
      "Dalot produced a tackle at Molineux on Thursday night that resulted in Raphael Varane, Onana and Martinez coming over and celebrating it like a goal. This may have been Martinez's way of returning the favour.",
      "As Harry Maguire gave the ball away in a dangerous area, few inside Old Trafford would have anticipated celebrating a second United goal a few moments later. But after the Reds had got themselves up the pitch quickly, the majority of those inside M16 were on their feet.",
      "Garnacho provided the all-important knockout blow, seeing a deflected effort fly past replacement West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. He wheeled over to the far side to celebrate the adjoining corners between the Stretford End and the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand.",
      "Once in position, he perched himself on the edge of the advertising hoardings and was soon joined by Kobbie Mainoo and Hojlund, with the duo sitting either side of him. Each donning huge smiles, they put their arms around each other for a few seconds, no doubt savouring the smiles and happy faces all around them. We could be seeing the same celebration on show time and time again in the coming years.",
      "After converting his second goal of the afternoon, Garnacho ran in the direction of where he had celebrated his first. Just like on the previous occasion, the youngster perched himself on the advertising hoardings.",
      "With Mainoo off the field of play by this juncture, there was no chance of his first celebration being replicated in full. However, after being mobbed by his teammates, Hojlund embraced his fellow forward and gave him a small kiss on the cheek. It was another moment that highlighted the togetherness and spirit within the squad.",

      "Man Utd youngster Kobbie Mainoo is making exceptional progress and he's already been likened to Paul Pogba.",
      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",
      "Pogba left on a free transfer to join Juventus in the summer of 2012 after failing to agree a new contract when it might have been advisable to build a team around him.",
      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",
      "His potential is frightening and a new star from Carrington has been born. He could be everything Pogba was supposed to be for United.",

      "Goals from Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund gave United a deserved 2-0 lead against Gary O'Neil's side before a controversial penalty decision was converted by Pablo Sarabia to make it 2-1. United then restored their two-goal cushion through Scott McTominay with a deft header.",
      "But the hosts fought back through Max Kilman and Pedro Neto to make it 3-3 before Kobbie Mainoo's superb finish in the 97th minute sealed all three points. And Ten Hag admits the clash at Molineux should never have been a contest when United put themselves in a commanding position at half-time.",
      "\"Yeah, we were, of course, very pleased with the win,\" he said via the club's website. \"It was a match with many stories and we are pleased with our levels - in the first hour, I would say, especially the first 45 minutes.",
      "\"But after that, we should have killed the game and we didn’t. We let them return but then the team showed character and got the win, so I’m happy for our fans. I would say it was a thriller, I think. For the neutral spectator, it was also very nice to watch this game. But for a manager, it gives some headaches.\"",
      "United take on West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday with both teams separated by just a single point. Ten Hag acknowledged the West Ham fixture will be a tricky one, with the Hammers coming into the game with a point to prove.",
      "\"Yes but it’s always about us,\" he said. \"I always have a lot of respect and I already mentioned the qualities, the positives from West Ham United. But it’s about us - where we deliver our standards, when we bring it on the pitch, when we play as a team, then we will win the game no matter what.",
      "\"So it’s all about us, they take responsibility as a team to win the game because the fans need the win and we need the three points.\" And the Dutchman admits his team cannot afford to drop too many more points as they sit nine points off the top four.",
      "\"It will not be decisive for the end of the season but in the Premier League, [there are] seven or eight teams competing for those four [Champions League] positions so we can’t give points away,\" Ten Hag added.",
      "\"You need every point and you have to fight for every point because the points will be more expensive when you go to the end of the season, so we have to make sure, to put us in the right position in the month of February, we have to win on Sunday.\"",

      "Man Utd will look to sign a couple of forwards in the summer transfer window, and Rasmus Hojlund could influence those plans.",
      "Erik ten Hag admits he wanted to sign another striker in the January transfer window. Rasmus Hojlund is at least easing those concerns for now.",
      "The Danish forward took a while to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League, but now he looks right at home with goals in three successive matches.",
      "What is most pleasing is that the last two goals in particular have been typical predatory finishes, with Hojlund in the right place at the right time to bundle the ball in from close range. He won't get much credit for those goals, but they are exactly the type United haven't been scoring in recent years.",
      "OPINION: Mainoo has done something no other player has done under Ten Hag",
      "Hojlund has also suffered from a lack of consistent support from his teammates so far this season, and it is no surprise his output has picked up at a time when a number of key players returned to the squad. His goal at Wolves, for example, would not have been possible without Luke Shaw in the side.",
      "There is real excitement surrounding Hojlund at the moment, and there is real intrigue about how good he can become after such a promising run of form. Although the answer may intrigue supporters, the club's transfer committee is in dire need of finding it before the summer transfer market opens.",
      "United are in the market for at least two forwards this summer, with Anthony Martial, Jadon Sancho, and Mason Greenwood all set to leave. Facundo Pellistri could also be sold, and Amad might need another loan move too. The jury is also very much out on Antony.",
      "Hojlund's form in the closing months of the season will influence the type of striker United look to add to their squad, as they consider both short-term solutions and long-term additions.",
      "There is still an argument United need another experienced option to help ease the burden on Hojlund, though signing a player currently in their prime would not be good for the player's development.",
      "Likewise, there is also a danger of signing another relatively inexperienced and raw striker, because it could be doubling their problem rather than halving it. This would also cause the issue of trying to develop two players at the same time, something that can't really be done when they only play with one central attacker.",
      "In an ideal world, United would add another experienced option in the same mould as previous signings Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Edinson Cavani this summer, though perhaps one who is slightly younger than those two were when they arrived, respectively.",
      "This would give United a viable alternative to Hojlund in the forward line, but at the same time, they would not have to promise them a key role and regular starts either.",
      "It seems like the best plan for United to reinforce their options this summer, yet in order for it to work, it relies on the Danish forward maintaining his recent level of improvement until the end of the campaign.",
      "Based on what we have seen in recent weeks, it certainly seems a possibility, and with the United side replenished by so many returning players, he finally has the service he has been missing for so long.",
      "Hojlund doesn't need replacing; he needs support.",

      "The feel-good story in a bad season thus far for Man United is Kobbie Mainoo, who could help them have a successful run-in.",
      "The Manchester United football director John Murtough was struggling for the appropriate word to summarise what he had just witnessed as he wandered up and down the tunnel at Molineux.",
      "United have registered two 97th-minute winners this season, three victories have been secured beyond the 90th minute, they have recovered from 2-0 down to win 3-2 twice and all but four of their triumphs have been won by one goal. Even in a season where United's goal difference is still in minus numbers, there has been more drama than in a West End play.",
      "When Erik ten Hag was almost on his knees against Brentford, Scott McTominay stood tall. Rasmus Hojlund was hunched over a seat and shaking his head in the dugout on Thursday night. Seconds later, he leapt into the arms of Harry Maguire.",
      "As much as United strive to win games as comfortably as possible, winning in the manner that they did at Wolves is the best feeling in sport, never mind football. Kobbie Mainoo, at the age of 18, has followed in the footsteps of Steve Bruce, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Paul Scholes et al. The good and the great have extended the legacy of Fergie Time.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson smiled broadly as the United away-dayers were kept at bay in the Steve Bull Stand. The incumbent United manager showed reasonable restraint as Mainoo jogged towards the moshpit on the far side.",
      "Ten Hag was not the only one. Maguire eschewed the celebrations and pointed to his temple. United had folded at 3-1 and there was still time on the clock. That was on Ten Hag's mind at his post-match press conference.",
      "\"To be honest, I had mixed feelings\" were Ten Hag's first words. He was vexed that United's performance had been undermined by preventable goals when they ought to have ended the night with their goal difference back in the positives.",
      "Ten Hag has not been as strident in his criticism of United when they have won this season and he was perhaps emboldened by the sight of his strongest XI on the pitch in his 94th match in charge. United neared the standards they set last season.",
      "Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez rekindled their Latino alliance in defence, celebrating blocks, tackles and goal kicks. Casemiro was serenaded louder than ever this season, Marcus Rashford's finish had the finesse of some of his clinical strikes last season and United scored four goals in a Premier League match for only the second time under Ten Hag.",
      "Ten Hag's constructive criticism in victory was a recurring theme in a successful 2022-23 campaign. \"Good is not good enough\" was his maxim. That has seldom been heard this season.",
      "Those five words neatly summarised United at Wolves. The first half was their best 45 minutes of the season. Ten Hag argued the performance level extended to an hour. And still United squandered two two-goal leads and sieved three goals in 24 minutes.",
      "It happened in Copenhagen and Istanbul. Mainoo did not start in either of those Champions League ties and, as raw as the 18-year-old is, United would have been in a better place had he avoided that deflating ankle injury in Houston against Real Madrid back in July. Mainoo is a diamond already sharp around the edges.",
      "He is the feel-good story of a bad season thus far for United. It is just as well a Stockport-born academy graduate who still lives with his parents and switches his engine off in the main car park at Carrington has emerged as the long-term linchpin of United's midfield.",
      "That was supposed to be Mason Mount, a £60million signing who has made nine starts in the last year and completed 90 minutes once. When Ten Hag was asked about Mount at Molineux, he spoke with a sombre tone that suggested United matchgoers could go another month without seeing him.",
      "\"He was struggling from the second game of the season,\" Ten Hag said. \"He returned for a period and then picked up another injury, so of course that’s not great.",
      "\"That is very frustrating for him and I really feel for him. I really want to be there for him because he had such high expectations and I had high expectations.\"",
      "Ten Hag added that \"by the end of the season he can stay fit and fight his way into the team, or at least play a role in his team\". The terrible troika of Michael Owen, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez made a quicker impression than the current United number seven.",
      "This season may well be a write-off for Mount, who had entered the last year of his contract at Chelsea. United have invested £60m to primarily foot his medical bills. Mount has been sidelined for a combined four months as a United player come next week.",
      "Mount was always a dubious choice to pair with Casemiro. In hindsight, United should have invested completely in Mainoo's development, deferred a midfield recruit for another year and put the £60m towards Harry Kane. Easier said than done and the consensus this time last year was United required a dynamic midfielder. Mount never fit that bill but Mainoo does.",
      "The theory that a player's reputation grows when they are out does not hold up with Mount. He struggled so much in his seven starts that no supporter or reporter has lamented his absence. Mainoo's was.",
      "He has already left Murtough speechless.",

      "\"Munich was a disaster for the club and how the club recovered from it, how individuals recovered from it, it was great from such a disaster to survive it and a couple of years later you’re lifting the biggest trophy in European football, that is immense.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Fellaini did not look right in a red shirt and many believed he represented the drop in standards following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson a few months earlier. The player's first year at Old Trafford coincided with a seventh-place finish in the Premier League - United's lowest since 1990.",

The midfielder stayed and fought, eventually finding his feet with Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho in charge, with the latter in particular getting the best out of him.",
      "The Belgian became an impact player, capable of scoring key goals, and he left to join Chinese side Shandong Taishan in 2019 with the best wishes of fans.

Many felt it was mimicking West Ham forward Mohammed Kudus, who celebrated in the exact same manner after scoring in the Hammers' 2-0 win over United at the London Stadium prior to Christmas, but it may also have been a nod to Garnacho's all-time hero, Cristiano Ronaldo, who has often celebrated in a similar manner.",
      "On his celebration, Garnacho quipped: \"I am very happy because I scored two goals. The celebration is an inspiration.\"",

      "He grabbed his first Premier League goal with a dramatic 97th-minute winner against Wolves on Thursday after another impressive showing. Mainoo’s current deal runs until 2027 but could soon have his stay extended. The academy graduate will not be offered new terms before the summer in a bid to avoid distraction from his on-field form.",

      "Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo played alongside each other for the first time in the Premier League when Man Utd overcame Wolves in their seven-goal thriller at Molineux",
      "Manchester United have splashed out £400million-plus since Erik ten Hag stepped into their dugout last summer. However, perhaps his most important and transformative addition to the first-team squad is one that didn't cost a penny.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the star that continues to rise at Old Trafford and beyond. There have been many false dawns in those barren post-Sir Alex Ferguson years - not to mention so much doom and gloom - but there are finally one or two shining lights at the end of the proverbial tunnel.",
      "After watching Alejandro Garnacho take his first steps last season, Mainoo - another supremely talented academy graduate - has followed his path this campaign. The Stockport-born teenager remains a Premier League rookie and yet eight games into his senior career has become almost undroppable.",
      "In doing so, the midfielder has helped United solve a transfer question Gary Neville asked this summer. Ultimately, though, the former captain turned TV pundit was not the only one to hold such concern.",
      "United must not heap too much pressure on him - or Garnacho for that matter - but match-goers understand that better than anyone. Instead, they can revel in two no-longer-hidden gems who could well provide the cornerstone for the club to turn things around on the pitch.",
      "Had things gone to plan, Mainoo would have been unleashed at an earlier juncture. Injury delayed his bow and by the time he made his mark on debut against Everton and other pre-Christmas games, Casemiro was unfortunately consigned to the Carrington treatment table himself.",
      "The fit-again Brazilian powerhouse returned against Wolves and - over his 73-minute outing - United were able to address Neville and do something they too have been longing to do. The present and future combined in their engine room for the very first time.",
      "Problems for United in midfield are long-standing. Ten Hag failed in his, at times, garishly public pursuit for Frenkie de Jong two summers ago, leading him to snap up an ageing Casemiro for £60million from Real Madrid in addition to four other players - including two loan deals - in that same position.",
      "Casemiro was not the player United wanted last season. However, the 31-year-old was a better fit for the squad at that time, protecting the back four virtually on his own.",
      "Question marks around his early-season form this campaign highlighted that United needed to make yet another move in that position. However, amid uncertainty and a lack of further conviction in the transfer market, a genuine and forward-thinking answer was right there in their own famed academy system.",
      "\"Casemiro looks lost in midfield in these first two matches,\" said Neville in August. \"What's clear is that Manchester United's midfield needs bolstering. Ten Hag wants a No.6 who can play alongside Casemiro and at the moment the club can't get players out to fund that.\"",
      "Although the club were proactive in sanctioning outgoings during the January transfer window, it was not overly necessary to create that pathway for Mainoo. He carved that out for himself by catching the eye in training and in matches while standing in for Casemiro over the winter.",
      "They can now continue to be unleashed together.",
      "\"It was impressive and there's no point getting carried away because the reality is he's got 17 or 18 years in front of him and a lot of work to do,\" said Neville after Mainoo wowed on debut. \"I always judge players when it's the most difficult part of the game and when Man United had their most difficult period in that first half I thought he was the only player who showed up, the only player who still looked like himself.",
      "\"The biggest compliment that I can pay him - and it hurts to say and I hope people can take that in the right spirit - he looked like a Manchester City player. I was thinking that's a player Pep Guardiola will be looking at and thinking; 'I want him in my midfield, that's what my midfield players do'.\"",
      "United will take a rare (recent) win on City by holding up Mainoo as a poster boy for a brighter future. His ongoing emergence has also helped them atone for some glaring misses in the transfer market.",

      "Shoretire's struggles are a reminder of the cutthroat nature of academy football. A homegrown talent at a club like United is the next best thing until another soon emerges to take their place.",
      "Erik ten Hag has taken on a more hands-on approach with the academy since he joined the club, having felt the U21s were 'isolated' before his arrival. He now takes an active role in deciding which youngsters train with the first team and has set the challenge for at least one youth team player to become part of the first team during every season he's at the club.",
      "The United manager won't give youngsters an opportunity just to keep up traditions, and he has made it clear that only the very best youth prospects will be given a chance in the senior set-up. Mainoo and Garnacho fit the criteria as elite talents; Shoretire should not be ashamed that he doesn't quite fit that bracket anymore.",
      "United are in preliminary talks with Shoretire over a new contract and still hope he agrees to new terms, as they look to protect his value in the increasingly likely scenario where he is sold in the coming years. A loan move was mooted in the January transfer window but never materialised.",
      "While the primary task of the club's illustrious academy is to produce talent for the first team, United also accept that it can be a money-making machine. With current Financial Fair Play rules, it is hugely beneficial to a club to sell homegrown players because the profit on the sale is purely classified as income.",
      "Isak Hansen-Aarøen was sold on deadline day, while Hannibal Mejbri moved to Sevilla on an initial loan with the option of a permanent sale, and Alvaro Fernandez left in a similar deal to join Benfica. Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado were all allowed to leave last summer.",
      "It would make sense if Shoretire was one of the next to join them in exiting the club. He has shone brightly at times, but now it looks to be in the interest of all parties if he were moved on too.",

      "Reports from Portuguese publication Record flag up interest from Al-Hilal and indicate the Saudi Pro League club made every attempt to sign him last month. Al-Hilal are managed by Jorge Jesus - who worked with Fernandes at Sporting Lisbon before his switch to United.",
      "Despite a heavy-handed attempt to bring Fernandes to the Gulf state, though, the 63-cap international is thought to have turned down that 'pharaonic proposal' to stay. The ex-Sampdoria playmaker is said to be keen on doing his utmost to ensure he wins further silverware at United after lifting the Carabao Cup last season.",

      "As a flurry of Manchester United supporters started to vacate their golden seats at Molineux, their golden boy forced them to come running back.",
      "With 97 minutes on the clock, Kobbie Mainoo could not have selected a better moment to score his first-ever Premier League goal. Pedro Neto's 95th-minute equaliser had, it seemed, earned Wolves a point, denying United a win that would have been fully merited.",
      "But as United's supporters prepared to criticise those all too familiar failings, such as wasted opportunities and their soft underbelly, Mainoo changed the mindset with a moment of individual brilliance. After dodging two challenges, he entered the penalty area, bent a right-footed effort towards the far corner and sent the away end barmy.",
      "United, to their credit, had produced some of the best football they had played all season, particularly in the first half. They looked menacing every time they went forward, with full-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw providing forward runs to support Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who netted the second goal as a result of one of Shaw's darts to the byline, was everywhere, chasing every ball and providing a focal point at the top end of the pitch for United to aim at. His combination play with Rashford and Garnacho, as well as Bruno Fernandes, suggests Ten Hag, just as he did against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, has discovered his best trio in attack to unleash United's potential.",
      "When Ten Hag deployed a front-three of Garnacho, Hojlund and Rashford against Villa, United scored three times, staging a brilliant second-half comeback at Old Trafford. On this occasion, United went one better and scored four for the second game running, following last weekend's dispatching of Newport County in the FA Cup at Rodney Parade.",
      "Though only two members of the front-three got on the scoresheet at Molineux, the second-half contributions of Scott McTominay, who put United 3-1 up less than two minutes after coming off the bench, and Mainoo meant United plundered four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since February 2022 - a 4-2 win over Leeds United at Elland Road under Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Scoring goals by the bucketload has been a problem for United throughout Ten Hag's tenure, highlighted by this season's tally of just 28 in 22 league matches. They have only scored four goals on two occasions in the Premier League under the Dutchman's stewardship.",
      "Nevertheless, though United's soft centre very nearly meant they exited the Black Country with just a point, they did, in the end, secure all three, which their performance so richly deserved. Their first-half showing was their best in a very long time.",
      "After a stop-start January, which featured just one league game, February offers United the opportunity to put together a run of positive results in their bid to climb the table. They are still outsiders to finish in the top four, currently finding themselves eight points shy of Tottenham Hotspur, but the landscape of the Premier League standings can change quickly with a few good results.",
      "Of course, United have been guilty of too many false dawns this season; they followed up a 2-1 win over Chelsea with a 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth three days later in December. This time around, perhaps because of the returns of Lisandro Martinez, Shaw and Casemiro, it feels different.",
      "There was an identity to United's play at Molineux and it translated into scoring four goals in a Premier League game for the first time since May, and the first time in a Premier League away game in two years. Their attack, particularly in the first half, looked menacing, with Rashford hungry to prove a point after last week's off-field events, Hojlund producing a polished performance and Garnacho once again highlighting why he is a better fit on the right wing than Antony.",
      "If United's performance at Molineux was a sign that everything is about to click into place, they need to prove it. West Ham United are up next and the Reds cannot afford to take their foot off the pedal after such a morale-boosting victory.",

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has warned he is 'hungry' to score more goals after netting for the fourth Premier League game in a row against West Ham on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Many felt the 4-3 victory against Wolves in midweek could be the turning point in the season and United built on that performance by securing a comfortable 3-0 win against the Hammers. Hojlund opened the scoring in the first half with an excellent finish and Alejandro Garnacho scored a brace after half-time to make sure of the result.",

I'm hungry for more and want to keep developing, keep scoring goals, keep moving up the table and keep getting wins.",

      "Man Utd could make one change to their side when they host West Ham in the Premier League today.",
      "Erik ten Hag named his strongest Manchester United side against Wolves. They still nearly managed to throw it all away.",
      "There were certainly positives to take from the dominant performance, and on another day, it might well have been a victory by a far bigger margin, but the harsh truth is that it wasn't. It was the same story against Newport a week ago. United could have won by a three- or four-goal margin but instead, they threw away another lead when they should have been comfortable.",
      "Yet it would still be a surprise if they chose to make any changes today. Ten Hag has regularly cited his ambition of having a settled squad, and now he has the opportunity to do just that.",
      "It doesn't mean they shouldn't, though. See, while it might be the strongest United side on paper, there is still an argument to suggest it could be better.",
      "United's midfield was ripped apart at ease twice in the last week, but Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo won't be dropped, and the defence has conceded five goals in three matches when the centre-back pairing is supposed to be world-class.",
      "Of course, keeping a clean sheet is not solely down to the centre-backs, but they are certainly a major factor. Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane are still widely believed to be the best two at the club, and yet the goals are still being gifted to opponents.",
      "Martinez was off the pitch by the time Pedro Neto netted a third goal at Molineux, with Varane the unfortunate victim of United's overcommitment in the attack that left the backline exposed. There was little they could have done about the other two Wolves goals, either.",
      "But the partnership of Martinez and Varane is still difficult to endorse due to their respective injury concerns. They have both missed a large part of the season through injuries, and the Argentine was replaced again in midweek as a precaution.",
      "There is hope that Martinez can put his recent injury woes behind them, but the reoccurring nature of Varane's cast doubt over his long-term suitability. For all of their huge achievements—after all, they are both World Cup winners—the best ability is availability, and that is something that neither of them have nailed down this season.",
      "Ten Hag's pursuit of consistency and momentum is being undermined by the regular changes at centre-back, and with a busy fixture schedule ahead, he needs that familiarity to stem from a settled defensive pairing.",
      "Martinez is an integral part of the plans due to his passing ability and the different angles he opens up as a left-footer, but the plan for the summer is to sign a suitable partner for him who complements his style of play.",
      "Varane just can't be relied upon in the long run, and Harry Maguire, who has arguably been the best-performing defender at the club this season, still doesn't seem to be the right fit for Ten Hag's desired style of play.",
      "It is telling that now nearly everyone is available; it is Varane who has been selected over Maguire, but the real test will be keeping the Frenchman fit, which is far easier said than done.",
      "United's defensive pairing is world-class, but only when they are actually fit.",

      "Erik ten Hag's side showed real character to go again after letting a two-goal lead slip in midweek, but they know they risk being punished if they don't eradicate the mistakes that so nearly cost them three points.",
      "The return of a few more players could help United, which presents Ten Hag with a welcome conundrum as he tries to select the strongest team. Here are the main talking points:",
      "There is more good news on the injury front, with Sofyan Amrabat and Victor Lindelof both in line to return to the squad today.",
      "Amrabat has not played since the goalless draw with Liverpool on December 17 due to injury and his participation with Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations. Lindelof has been sidelined since December 6 after undergoing groin surgery.",
      "Neither of the players will go into the starting lineup, but they will at least give Ten Hag some more experienced options to call upon from the bench.",
      "Crisis? What crisis? Rasmus Hojlund took a while to adapt to the Premier League, but now it looks like he has finally settled and will only get better.",
      "Like all great goalscorers, the Danish forward was in the right place at the right time to score goals against Newport and Wolves, and he looks full of confidence for the first time in a United shirt.",
      "Hojlund now has three goals and two assists across his last four appearances and is also doing a lot of the dirty work as well. Just as impressive as his goal against Wolves was a brilliant piece of hold-up play in the first half when he used a combination of silk and steel to take the ball past opposition players before unleashing a perfect pass for Marcus Rashford.",
      "We know he can score goals in the Premier League. The next challenge is to do it on a consistent basis.",
      "It is hard to recall any poor performances from Kobbie Mainoo in a United shirt so far. But his worst was certainly the defeat to West Ham two days before Christmas.",
      "The 18-year-old largely looked calm and composed in possession but made a costly error when he failed to control a simple pass to set up Mohammed Kudus for the second goal of the match.",
      "Mainoo has already come a long way since that tough afternoon at the London Stadium, and today he will be looking to prove that those mistakes really are a rarity in his rise to the top.",
      "Speaking of that trip to the London Stadium back in December, it is hard to ignore Kudus again. It felt inevitable he would score in that meeting on a day when former teammate Antony had another performance to forget.",
      "Of all the Ajax players Ten Hag could have signed, Kudus was arguably the one best suited to their attacking line. He cost less than half the price as well.",
      "The Ghanaian is back from the Africa Cup of Nations and won a vital penalty for West Ham on Thursday night, shortly before Antony nearly cost his team with his careless loss of possession that led to a late Wolves equaliser.",
      "United will hope to subdue Kudus this time around, but rather than a battle against Antony, he will have to try and outshine Alejandro Garnacho instead. It'll be a tough ask.",
      "Garnacho has made the right-wing role his own in recent weeks and was excellent from out wide in midweek as well. Many fans would swap Kudus for Antony, but they wouldn't swap him for Garnacho.",
      "United are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League home games against West Ham (W12 D3), winning each of the last three 1-0. The last team to win four consecutive home games against an opponent by the same scoreline was Sunderland against Man City, who beat them 1-0 four times in a row at the Stadium of Light between 2010 and 2013.",
      "West Ham haven't beaten United in the league at Old Trafford since their famous final-day victory in 2007. It was also the last time they completed a league double against them.",
      "The history books certainly back United to win again today, but recent records provide plenty of doubt. West Ham have earned 17 points from their 11 away league games so far this season (W5 D2 L4), already five more than they earned on the road in the whole of last season.",
      "Old Trafford isn't a fortress either. United have conceded seven goals in their last three Premier League home games, going down 3-0 against Bournemouth, beating Aston Villa 3-2, and drawing 2-2 with Spurs. They’ve not conceded multiple goals in four consecutive home league games since November–January 1971–72.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is starting to find his feet at Man Utd and Erik ten Hag has praised his attitude and character to keep going during a difficult season.",
      "Erik ten Hag has praised Rasmus Hojlund's \"resilience and calmness\" after lauding his £72millon striker for starting to live up to the expectations he has set himself at Manchester United.",
      "The 20-year-old endured a difficult start to his Old Trafford career in a team that was losing its way, but although the goals didn't flow for Hojlund, his attitude never changed and he never went missing.",
      "Ten Hag revealed the striker was getting \"angry and mad\" as he went 14 Premier League games without a goal since his summer switch from Atalanta, but after breaking his duck against Aston Villa he has now scored in three successive top-flight games, taking his tally in all competitions to nine this season.",
      "Hojlund has played more often than United expected this season, playing 66% of available minutes and only Andre Onana, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot have played more minutes than Hojlund's 1,911 in all competitions.",
      "There is a feeling he has been thrown in at the deep end at United, with Anthony Martial suffering from injury and inconsistency and Hojlund taking on the mantle of starting striker when he remained relatively inexperienced, having had a rapid rise in the 18 months since FC Copenhagen sold him to Sturm Graz.",
      "But Ten Hag is beginning to see the traits that convinced him Hojlund was the right man this summer and they are mental attributes as much as physical ones.",
      "\"I can tell you it’s not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself, also the outside world has high expectations, to fulfil that when it’s not working,\" explained Ten Hag.",
      "\"That is the character every striker needs, he gets angry, he gets mad when he’s not scoring, but that’s why we selected him, he has the resilience and the calmness to perform under that stress.",
      "\"He doesn’t have any moment that he wants to give up, he keeps going every time to put himself in the right position. I’m happy he now starts to score, but it counts for many young players there is a lot of space for improvement, but he’s still now on very good levels.\"",
      "Hojlund has scored in Premier League games against Aston Villa, Tottenham and Wolves, as well as finding the net in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Newport County. He also teed up Marcus Rashford for his redemptive opener at Molineux on Thursday and Ten Hag believes there is a partnership forming between his attacking stars.",
      "\"He is a great character, he always keeps going, always wants to improve,\" he said. \"You see now the team is better and more stable, now we serve the front line better and he starts scoring.",
      "\"You see there is something growing with Rashy, with Garnacho, with Bruno, also other players from the second and the third line. He is coming more in a position to score.\"",

      "The Dutch defender is now 26 years old and is nowhere near as close to starting games on a regular basis as he would have hoped when he turned down a new contract and left to join Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "It began well with six starts in a row following his January move in 2021. But then came the first of a string of serious injuries that have limited him to just 30 appearances in three years. He has spent 935 days injured in his professional career and has been unavailable for 146 games as a result.",
      "FEATURE: I rejected Liverpool to sign for United and then quit City medical for Arsenal",
      "It is staggering to realise Fosu-Mensah has still played for the United first team as many times as he has for Leverkusen and only mustered 1,014 minutes of action in the last three years. Last season, 15 appearances were spread out over just 196 minutes. He hasn't made one competitive appearance so far this campaign.",
      "As he nears a return to fitness, he will be desperate to step out on the pitch again in the coming weeks, but Leverkusen are a very different team from when he arrived. Xabi Alonso is the manager, Jeremie Frimpong is a superstar in his preferred position and Leverkusen lead Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga title race.",
      "It's a far cry from the hype that followed him at United when he was one of the brightest young talents in the Premier League and feared by former Man City ace Leroy Sane.",
      "\"It was before when I was playing against Kyle Walker. And Crystal Palace's right-back Timothy Fosu-Mensah, I have played against him twice this season, and even last season, he had me really well under control and I told him how happy I was to play against him,\" he said of his toughest opponents.",
      "That was during one of two Premier League loan spells Fosu-Mensah would go on during his time at United, with the Dutch defender rated highly enough to get opportunities at both Palace and Fulham.",
      "The versatile defender made his debut for United under Louis van Gaal, winning the FA Cup in his debut season as a senior player when he was just 18. He might have feared for his place when Jose Mourinho arrived the following summer but he still featured 11 times under the Portuguese coach, lifting the League Cup and the Europa League in his first term.",
      "Those experiences made him a more developed player, even if the treatment was harsh at times.",
      "“I spent the full [2016/17] season with the first team and as a result of that, I completed a full pre-season with them for the first time,\" he said. “I was still a teenager when Jose Mourinho arrived and he helped me mature into becoming a man in footballing terms.",
      "“Jose was tough on young players with his demands but in a good way because he wanted you to be ready to represent a club the size of Manchester United. He helped make me stronger mentally and physically.",
      "“I remember playing against Northampton Town in the early rounds of the League Cup – which we went on to win at the end of the season – and I did not have my best game.",
      "“He subbed me after 60 minutes and we had a Europa League game coming up a week or so after the League Cup game, which I did not think I had a chance of playing in after he subbed me off. However, he started me in the Europa League game and I played the full game which gave me confidence to continue to grow at the club.",
      "\"We went on to win the Europa League against Ajax at the end of the season and that was a great achievement for the club.",
      "“Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed working under Jose Mourinho. He was really good with me as a young player. He is open-minded and he is a very good manager, as his career has shown.”",
      "Mourinho's treatment of young players is well documented but what was so tough for Fosu-Mensah was that not even key ally Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could find a regular place for him in the squad.",
      "Those two loan exits had been sanctioned by Mourinho and the second was cut short when he suffered a knee ligament injury, which saw him return to United in the closing stages of the 2018–19 season. By the time he returned, there was a new manager in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "Fosu-Mensah watched from the sidelines as the United hero went about rebuilding the squad and then, against all the odds, he got opportunities he never expected due to the curtailed pandemic campaign. In June of 2020, Fosu-Mensah made his first United senior matchday squad since May 2017 as he sat on the bench in an FA Cup tie against Norwich.",
      "A month later, with Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams both out injured, Solskjaer called on him to start at left-back ahead of Diogo Dalot against former side Palace at Selhurst Park. He would make another four appearances in the final matches of the season, including in semi-final defeats of both the FA Cup and Europa League.",
      "The Dutch defender was now fully fit, confident, and raring to go into the new campaign. He was desperate to get his chance and he got one right away. Things didn't go according to plan.",
      "He started right back in the opening-day defeat to Crystal Palace but after a poor performance, he was dropped again. Fosu-Mensah only featured from the bench twice more in Champions League defeats away to Istanbul Basaksehir and RB Leipzig.",
      "He would never play for the club again. Fosu-Mensah rejected a new contract as he felt 'undervalued' by the terms offered. Those close to the player insisted he was sad to be leaving but 'excited to get a fresh start and show people what he was really capable of.'",
      "\"It was my decision,\" he later reiterated. \"The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing. I didn’t play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.",
      "“The club and the manager were good to me. I recovered from a big injury; they helped me and gave me minutes. I played in the FA Cup semi-final and the Europa League semi-final. But it’s important to play regularly and to get my opportunity in the national team too.",
      "“Ole has been very good to me. I spoke with him because he had a big injury as a player so he knew exactly how I felt. When I played against Crystal Palace after 16 months, he was very happy for me. These were very good moments. He knew I had the quality. I have no bad things to say about him because he has been very good to me.\"",
      "It's a real shame that three years later he is back where he was to begin with: looking to prove himself after another serious injury. Fosu-Mensah should be praised for taking the risk to leave the club when he had doubts about his future and if there is anyone who deserves a slice of luck, it is him.",
      "Leverkusen and United fans will be happy to see him back. Leroy Sane might not be so happy to face him again.",

      "Louis van Gaal was in charge by then and he provided Varela with a string of appearances, with the right-back making his United senior bow against West Ham in December 2015.",
      "\"I have been pleased with the progress of the younger players when they've been called to train with the first-team squad so I am not afraid of using them if required,\" Van Gaal said.",
      "Just three days later, Varela made his first start for United when playing in a 3-2 defeat to Wolfsburg, a result which sealed the Reds' exit from the Champions League. However, Matteo Darmian was Van Gaal's first-choice right-back and he continued to be selected for the majority of games, which meant Varela had to be patient for starts.",
      "That patience was rewarded in February 2016 when Darmian sustained an injury, which meant Varela started in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 32 against FC Midtjylland. Varela assisted Marcus Rashford in a comfortable 5-1 win and he was one of the best performers that night, which saw him retain his place for the Round of 16 clash against Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool won the first leg 2-0 at Anfield and Varela started again in the reverse fixture, but what happened next essentially ended his time at the club.",
      "Anthony Martial opened the scoring with a penalty in the 32nd minute, but Liverpool equalised just before half-time when Phillipe Coutinho burst down the left and went around Varela.",
      "Coutinho made beating Varela look simple before he dinked the ball over David de Gea and that mistake was enough for Van Gaal to hook him during the interval.",
      "\"It is football,\" Varela later said about his performance and substitution against Liverpool. “Van Gaal gave me the chance to play so I have to say thank you. He is a crazy coach.",
      "\"He was always angry with the players but it was good. I enjoyed it. I played 11 matches. I enjoyed every single one. I played one game in the Champions League, I played in the Europa League. Playing for Manchester United is amazing. Of course, it was a dream.",
      "“Growing up, it was always about Manchester United, ahead of Real Madrid and Barcelona, because of Diego Forlan playing there. So for a player from Uruguay, it was a dream to play for Manchester United. He was my hero.",
      "“But I had to play more. At Manchester United, playing only one or two games a month was not good. I had to play every game and at Manchester United that was difficult.”",
      "Varela featured in a handful of first-team and academy matches during the remainder of that season, so it wasn't a surprise to see him omitted from the 2016 FA Cup final squad.",
      "Van Gaal was sacked after victory against Crystal Palace in that final and Jose Mourinho was named as his successor. The Portuguese took his first pre-season match against Wigan and Varela came on from the bench, but there was no room for him on the subsequent tour of China.",
      "United embarked on their pre-season tour and Varela was sent on loan again, this time to Eintracht Frankfurt. He was now 23 and aware he needed a run of consistent matches. But disaster struck in just Varela's third appearance for Frankfurt when he suffered torn ankle ligaments, which required surgery and a screw inserted into his leg.",
      "Varela returned to action after five months on the sidelines, but he was still struggling with pain caused by the injury, so he underwent further surgery. Although the injury meant he was unavailable for the DFB-Pokal Cup final against Borussia Dortmund, it was suggested his absence was actually due to an infected tattoo.",
      "Varela had received fresh ink during his spell on the sidelines and it allegedly caused inflammation of his arm. Frankfurt reacted by suspending him and ordering his return to Manchester.",
      "\"My name is polluted. I wonder what Real Madrid should do with Sergio Ramos, who is tattooing every week,\" Varela reacted at the time, trying to protest his innocence.",
      "\"I cannot explain why I'm being so severely punished, and I'm not the only Eintracht professional to get a tattoo before the final, but only I was nailed to the cross for going against the manager.",
      "\"Before the 2016 FA Cup final [against Crystal Palace], we went out with several players and got a tattoo, and then we won. Now I wanted to repeat that because it brought us so much luck with Manchester.\"",
      "Frankfurt's sporting director responded: \"The club cannot tolerate that a player would defy instructions. He hurt the team. There was redness around where he had the tattoo, and blisters formed meaning he was unable to train.",
      "\"We'd been thinking about a loan extension. But that won't happen. He'll be suspended with immediate effect.\"",
      "A few years later, Varela attempted to clarify the tattoo situation. “I got a tattoo at the top of my back on my neck,\" he said. \"It was during my injury, while I was not playing, about three months before the final in May.",
      "“[Manager] Niko Kovac said to me, 'I don't want you to get any more tattoos.' I said, 'Why? I'm injured'. He said, 'Yes, I know but you have to respect the players and the staff.'",
      "“I said, 'Okay, I understand but I am injured.' Then when I started to play again I got this one done on my arm [a woman's face].",
      "\"He said to me, 'No, no, no. You stop here because we have the final in one week and I told you before you have to finish with your tattoos so now you are out.' I didn't get infected, that's not true. It was just because I got it.”",
      "Varela returned to Manchester after a disappointing spell with Frankfurt but had no regrets. \"I talked to Jose Mourinho and we talked about my future and what would be best for me,\" he told the Manchester Evening News.",
      "\"He was very sincere towards me. He told me my playing time would be little so my decision was that I preferred to go. A player needs to play and that's what I sought in Frankfurt.\"",
      "Varela was sold by Mourinho in the summer of 2017 and he re-signed for Penarol. \"I really learnt a lot from the way he [Mourinho] trained - the ball was always in the centre of the exercises,\" he said.",
      "\"The relationship was very good and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I expected his character when he is confronted with the press, but that was definitely not the case.",
      "\"He's always asking how everyone feels, making no difference between Rooney or a player who has just come up. He was always joking and ensuring he had a good connection between everyone and himself.\"",
      "His time at United came to an underwhelming end and, at the time, a source close to the player told the MEN that he returned to his former club for 'personal tranquillity'.",
      "\"The player decided [to join Penarol] after how badly he was treated in Frankfurt. His experience in Europe was not good,\" they said.",
      "Varela left having made 11 first-team appearances for United and he also scored an injury-time winner as the club's Under-21s won the academy Premier League title in 2016.",
      "Many fans were disappointed to see Varela leave the club and he got his career back on track with Penarol before eventually returning to Europe in January 2019.",
      "Varela signed for FC Copenhagen and it was there he admitted he would love a return to Old Trafford in the future. “It would be a dream to go back to Old Trafford. It would be a beautiful moment,\" he said.",
      "\"I wait for this. Maybe we will get drawn to play Manchester United - we don't know. But if we do, it would be a dream. Maybe we will meet again soon. Maybe in the Europa League, maybe in the Premier League.",
      "“I'm still only 26. I of course want to go back to the Premier League at some point. In the future, maybe I can come back and play for Manchester United - I hope.",
      "“I would say thank you to the fans. I want to say thank you for a beautiful four years, thank you for your support.”",
      "Varela was denied his wish of a return to Old Trafford by the pandemic because when United drew Copenhagen in the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2020, it was a one-off match and played at a neutral venue in Germany. Nonetheless, he started the game and was brought off in extra time.",
      "Varela made over 50 appearances for Copenhagen and played a similar number of games when signing for Dynamo Moscow, but he desired a return to South America.",
      "Since the summer of 2022, Varela has played for Brazilian club Flamengo and represented Uruguay at the Qatar World Cup.",
      "He has finally found his 'personal tranquillity' at 30 years old.",

      "Heading into the January transfer window, Manchester United supporters were keen to see new faces.",
      "United have underperformed so far this season as injuries, a loss of form and disciplinary matters plagued the squad, leading to a Champions League exit and an uphill battle to secure a top-four finish. Erik ten Hag admitted to wanting a new striker in the January transfer window following the victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League. Alas, United stuck to their guns this winter.",
      "Before the window opened, club officials stressed they were not interested in conducting major business in January - and that stance preceded no new signings. However, this did not stop the club from completing a host of departures: several academy players and fringe stars departed on loan, notably Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri and Facundo Pellistri.",
      "The biggest exit from a United perspective came as Jadon Sancho left on loan to join Borussia Dortmund. Crucially though, the Bundesliga giants have confirmed they will find it difficult to make this switch permanent in the summer. This news, coupled with the lack of signings means this window could be considered below par among the fanbase. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have a huge summer ahead of them, with multiple areas of the squad needing quality.",
      "By the time the next window opens, Ratcliffe should have had his investment in United ratified by the Premier League and his staff will be tasked with rebuilding the club.

      "Fellaini was mocked for what he represented as much as anything, with United often resorting to him when they ran out of ideas in the closing stages of matches and grew desperate. He was also synonymous with the club's transfer failure, having ended up being United's sole summer signing in a season in which the club finished seventh and Moyes was sacked after just 10 months in charge.",

      "A number of clubs, including Preston and Bolton Wanderers, had expressed an interest during this month's transfer window in taking the 19-year-old on board, but - with guidance from his father - it was the Potteries side that won the day and he could make his debut this weekend against Portsmouth.",
      "The MEN reported yesterday how United had agreed on Port Vale as Gore's destination because of the way they play and their support system for young players.",
      "He said: \"Well, I think from the first time I've come here to see the place and meet everyone, I just knew straight away. Because I got a feeling it's just like a family. Everyone was very welcoming.",
      "\"I've obviously seen Port Vale play and they play very good football.",
      "\"My dad was shocked. He was like: 'Son, you've got to go there'. He just knew they'd take care of me and obviously, at this stage of my career, I need that because I'm still developing. He knew, straight away, he got the best feeling from here.\"",
      "Gore is friends with Vale's Manchester-born midfielder Tommy McDermott, who also urged him to agree to the switch, and he'll also see familiar faces there in the guise of ex-Reds Tom Sang and James Wilson.",
      "\"Tommy said definitely go, it'll be the best experience for you,\" added Gore. \"You'll develop really well.",
      "\"I can guarantee hard work and determination to do everything for the badge; to do our best to try to get the three points in every game. The most important thing is winning.",
      "\"I trained Monday and Tuesday and they went really good. I trained hard and am looking forward to keeping going.\"",

      "Manchester United will not progress to the last eight of the Continental League Cup as a result of the FA punishing Aston Villa Women, but not expelling them from the competition altogether",
      "Manchester United say they are \"very disappointed\" and are 'considering their options' following an FA ruling which has seen them dumped out of the Continental League Cup as a result of Aston Villa's administrative error.",
      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",
      "Maritz, who moved to Bescot Stadium from Women's Super League (WSL) rivals Arsenal earlier this month, was introduced in the second half against Sunderland, despite already being cup-tied. She had featured three times for the Gunners in the competition earlier in the season, starring against Bristol City, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "READ |  Tielemans starts, Bailey returns - Aston Villa starting XI vs Newcastle picked",
      "As a result, her introduction against Sunderland was in breach of Conti Cup rule 8.14 - which deals with the fielding of an ineligible player - and the points for the contest have instead been awarded to the Black Cats. An FA statement released on Monday said: \"An independent tribunal have deducted three points from Aston Villa for fielding an ineligible player during their FA Women’s Continental Tyres League Cup group stage fixture against Sunderland on Wednesday 24 January 2024.",
      "\"The FA alleged that the player was ineligible for this game, as she had previously featured in the competition for her former club, which constitutes a breach of Cup Rule 8.19. Aston Villa admitted this charge and acknowledged the breach had occurred. The independent tribunal ordered that the points deducted from Aston Villa be awarded to their opponents Sunderland, while the 7-0 scoreline is to be expunged from the record.",
      "\"As a result, Sunderland will finish as Group A winners, with Aston Villa progressing to the quarter-finals as one of the two best-placed runners-up alongside Tottenham Hotspur.\"",
      "Responding to the news, a Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We are very disappointed with this outcome and do not understand its rationale. We feel that it undermines the integrity of the competition and of the women's game. We are considering our options in response.\"",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's fierce shot gave Erik ten Hag's team the lead in the first half, on the occasion of the striker's 21st birthday, before two second-half strikes by Garnacho took the game away from West Ham. Kalvin Phillips made another error for the third goal.",
      "West Ham had 20 shots and might have equalised just before Garnacho's first had Emerson Palmieri capitalised on an error by Harry Maguire on the England defender's return to the team. But David Moyes' men were not clinical and their opponents were.",
      "The result sees Manchester United leapfrog West Ham into sixth spot and build on the momentum of their late winner at Wolves on Thursday evening. It is five unbeaten in all competitions now. Momentum might just be building at Old Trafford.",

      "On the weekend that Old Trafford paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6 1958, Manchester United were looking to build on their midweek win over Wolves but Moyes' West Ham side made for testing opponents.",
      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",
      "But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed.",
      "Manchester United have had false dawns before and this was far from a totally dominant display. But, with key players back from injury, two wins in four days have begun to change the complexion of their Premier League season. Upwardly mobile once more?",
      "Ten Hag revealed afterwards the knee injury to Martinez is \"a personal disaster\" for the player. \"I can't say but it doesn't look good,\" said the United boss when speaking in the press conference. \"There is a bad concern. We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis.",
      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "West Ham boss Moyes also said Martinez made \"a huge difference\" for Manchester United. \"He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play. I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable.\"",

      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Erik ten Hag says Lisandro Martinez potentially suffered a \"very bad\" injury in Manchester United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday.",
      "Ten Hag added the injury to Martinez - who only returned from a long-term foot injury last month - is a \"personal disaster\" for the defender.",
      "Martinez suffered the issue when tangling with Vladimir Coufal as he attempted to shield the ball out for a goal-kick in the second half at Old Trafford and was replaced shortly afterwards.",
      "Asked how serious the Argentina international's issue is, Ten Hag said: \"I can't say but it doesn't look good. There is a bad concern.",
      "\"We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis. We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage.",
      "\"He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad, but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",

      "Martinez spent nearly three months on the sidelines before returning for the 2-2 draw with Tottenham on January 14.",

      "However, they have actually won more points and conceded fewer goals per match without Martinez in the side in the Premier League this season.",

      "Manchester United have won four out of their last six games, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo impressing; both teenagers have stepped up for Erik ten Hag ahead of the season run-in;  watch Man Utd vs West Ham live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm",
      "Sunday 4 February 2024 12:28, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

City won 14 of 15 Premier League games between the 22nd-36th Premier League gameweeks last season. This is their time.",
      "My punting instincts have taken me to the player fouls market where Ruben Dias rates as a fair wager to make two or more fouls at 100/30 with Sky Bet. The Brentford front two of Neal Maupay and Ivan Toney bring the nuisance factor to the table in that they are very smart at winning fouls.",
      "Since being paired together in their last two fixtures, they've won 12 fouls between them. It's a ratio that should stay consistent so it certainly brings Dias into the mix in terms of his foul probability. He's made two or more fouls in seven of his last 13 starts, making 17 fouls in total. He will fight fire with fire up against the Brentford duo. He's a big price.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",

      "Report and highlights as Kobbie Mainoo's goal won a seven-goal thriller for Manchester United at Molineux. Pedro Neto had equalised for Wolves in stoppage time. United led by two goals twice with Marcus Rashford scoring on his return to the team",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",
      "Wolves: Sa (5), Kilman (6), Dawson (6), Toti (4), Semedo (6), Doyle (6), Lemina (6), Doherty (4), Bellegarde (5), Neto (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ait-Nouri (7), Sarabia (7), Gomes (n/a), Fraser (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (5), Dalot (6), Varane (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Mainoo (8), Casemiro (6), Garnacho (6), Fernandes (7), Rashford (7), Hojlund (7).\n\n\nSubs: Antony (5), McTominay (7), Maguire (n/a), Evans (n/a), Forson (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",
      "\"You are tested in the Premier League, the emotion of it. We go completely off plan [after Rashford's early goal] and start opening up big spaces. But in terms of the togetherness, the work ethic, I thought second half, we were by far the better side.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Gary Neville:",
      "\"I was a part of those games when you've given a goal away at one end and somehow one of your special players would do something special and the goal was sensational by Mainoo. We've seen different types of goals but for him to keep such composure and put the ball in between someone's legs and the finish!",
      "\"He's a fantastic player. I think to come into Man Utd team in any team is very difficult and he's come into the team in one of the club's most difficult times in recent history and he's just stood out as being someone whose temperament and composure is off the scale.",
      "\"He's got the world at his feet for the next few years and there's been an example where you can get carried away: Marcus Rashford had the same. But he's got 15 years coming up, Mainoo, where he's got to keep feet on the ground. But he's got all the attributes that you would need to be a top player.\"",

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",

      "\"I was getting back at 6am and I still went to training out of respect. Not just for me, who had lost all respect, but for my team-mates and my manager. I can't back him on that, when you hear he was put back to bed at 3am.",
      "\"The lad has got the biggest talent in the world. Last year, he was unplayable. This year, I think I could do as well as him this season. Football is a short career, and the way the game is changing now - he only has four or five years left before he's 30 tops and you can party as much as you want. Don't ruin it, don't ruin it.",
      "\"I think he's made a mistake - and I know he's made a few - but he can play. With Jadon Sancho, he was someone who didn't get going and didn't really turn it on. He proved that last season.",
      "\"But he's got to be careful. With Sancho, Man Utd had seen enough of him and said: 'he's not going to take us places'. With turning up late, Rashford has just got to get his head down.",
      "\"It's a short career and it soon goes. With Gareth Southgate, he's a disciplinarian. I know him, he was my captain at Villa and he doesn't like at that - the not turning up.",
      "\"You've got England, who I think will win the Euros this summer, so you've got to be there. You can make history. Gareth knows the players, he ain't one of those managers who talks to you only when you turn up to England training.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been the focus of yet another disciplinary breach at Man Utd; this is the third time the England forward has clashed with Erik ten Hag over transgressions; INEOS want to introduce a culture change at Manchester United, but will Rashford's behaviour fit into it?",
      "Wednesday 31 January 2024 09:47, UK",
      "If the words in Manchester United's statement on Marcus Rashford, released late on Monday night, sounded familiar, it is not a trick of the mind.",
      "Two months ago, when the England international partied at Chinawhite nightclub after the derby undressing against Manchester City, Erik ten Hag said \"he apologised and that is it. It is an internal matter\".",
      "The location and context has changed - Rashford reporting himself ill for training last Friday after going out in Belfast the previous two nights - but the protagonist and United's communication remains the same.",
      "Erik ten Hag will face the media at 12.30pm on Wednesday - follow it live on the Sky Sports app and website.",
      "\"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions,\" read the club's statement. \"This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed.\"",
      "Rashford has to ensure it is indeed shut - and not just for a matter of weeks. It is the third time the 26-year-old has been caught transgressing under Ten Hag, the first of which was arriving late for a team meeting.",
      "That seemed innocuous, but his actions since have sparked concerns - even before the tequila-filled details of Thursday emerged from an alleged eyewitness account.",
      "It's not solely Rashford's focus that is in question, but a harsher spotlight is now on the continuous off-field issues at United.",
      "It was during September, in the immediate aftermath of Jadon Sancho's social media offensive against being a \"scapegoat\", that warnings of misbehaviour from other members of the squad began to circulate.",
      "Several privy to the winger's anger at being singled out, isolated, and effectively cancelled at the club before rejoining Borussia Dortmund on loan, insisted there were players flouting Ten Hag's standards at Carrington and beyond.",
      "When Rashford was celebrating at Chinawhite in the early morning despite needing to report to training at the end of October, it was flagged as an example.",
      "However, the incident was brushed aside as a one-off by people close to the forward; it was simply a pre-arranged birthday party.",
      "Ten Hag had also insisted Rashford was \"very motivated to put things right. I know how much effort he is putting in. He makes a mistake but that doesn't say he is not fitting in.",
      "\"He is totally with us. He makes one mistake but also off the pitch what he is doing, how he lives, I am sure he is doing everything right to help the team and to perform and let us win.\"",
      "Managers do not take well to having their authority undermined, being misled, and let down after publicly standing up for a player.",
      "Rashford's repeated eroding of the standards and rules set under the Dutchman is set to send him on a collision course with Ten Hag, but he is also at high risk of clashing with the \"clean culture\" INEOS aim to implement under their sporting control.",
      "As Sky Sports revealed in December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe will implement a more ruthless approach to United's process over player contracts in a bid to prioritise the right ethos and recruitment strategy over business interests.",
      "United want to be more \"culture-focused\" in their decision-making and have noted Arsenal as an example where cutting ties with players instead of trying to hold out for a fee can help reshape a squad and develop an environment of healthy habits and success.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, on United's board and still wading through an audit of the club's football operations, addressed the squad on Monday. He talked them through the INEOS plan of creating an \"ecosystem of excellence\" and how that can only be achieved through total investment from the players, collaborative effort and discipline.",
      "That speech came amid Rashford and his brother/agent Dwaine Maynard meeting with Ten Hag and football director John Murtough, to get a handle on the striker's behaviour.",
      "Rashford means more than most to United, and they have been doing the most to crack the conundrum of what is going on with him. Some at the club feel he just needs a reconfiguring, to be honest with himself about what is truly important and of value to him.",
      "It is interesting to remember what Rashford himself has said about performance less than a year ago. \"Football is probably 95 per cent your mentality. That gives you the baseline to perform. There are a lot of players that have ability - that's why they play at the top level. But what sets them apart is the mentality. I've been on both sides of it.",
      "\"I understand the strength of it and the value. I'm concentrating a lot more on keeping myself in that headspace and it's needed in order to win games and trophies.\"",
      "It is unsurprising that United have sharply moved to draw a line under the misdemeanour. The club have been beset with off-pitch drama in various shapes and at levels of seriousness.",
      "They can ill afford to add another high-profile name and situation to the list. The control for that is out of United's hands though and in Rashford's. He has to show the club, his manager, the supporters and INEOS that he can be trusted.",
      "And that is before his performances even enter the equation. Rashford was in the form of his life last season, top-scoring for United with 30 goals following an inconsistent 18-month stretch hampered by residual shoulder pain.",
      "His return reads four so far this term, in a struggling team desperate for his brilliance when the manager's future and direction of the club is uncertain.",
      "It has been emphasised that if Rashford was still prolific, there would be no fuss over what he was getting up to away from training and matches.",
      "The counter to that is a thread Ten Hag has often stated: what happens on the pitch is a direct result of how you're applying yourself off it. \"I demand the highest standards in sleep, recovery and nutrition because that makes the difference if you can perform every third or fourth day,\" the manager has stated.",
      "He also believes that if you do not respect training in the modern era, you cannot master matches.",
      "Rashford has actually agreed with Ten Hag on this. When he was dropped to the bench against Wolves for arriving late to a team meeting, his assessment was as follows: \"If I was a coach, I'd have done the same. Because if you don't have standards in the training ground, how do you expect to go out on the pitch and win consistently? It's impossible.",
      "\"If you're going to allow each other to slip or have an off day and no one says anything about it … which is at times a position that we've been in.",
      "\"And once you're in it it's difficult to get out of it because it becomes normal and I've not seen it at this club before. It was a little bit strange and it's even more strange when you're involved in it [at Wolves]. So it's constant reminders about discipline.\"",
      "He needs to get his own memos. Rashford will mark eight years in the first team next month. He is in the highest bracket of its earners. Seen as the reference point, it's time to permanently start acting like it again.",

      "The first competitive game between the two clubs had been billed as the biggest in Newport's history, with just over 9,000 crammed into modest surroundings for a tie expected to earn the League Two club around £400,000.",
      "Despite the scoreline, this was far from comfortable thanks to the brief flicker of chaos that has punctuated Manchester United's season.",
      "Ten Hag said his side were not in a position to underestimate any opponent on the eve of this encounter, and the Dutchman confirmed before kick-off that Marcus Rashford's absence is being treated as \"an internal matter\" after the forward was photographed out in Belfast earlier this week.",
      "This has been a challenging second season in the hot seat for Ten Hag, whose side languish eighth in the Premier League and were eliminated from European competition before Christmas.",
      "United's Carabao Cup defence is also long since over, meaning the FA Cup has taken on extra significance as their only potential route to a trophy in a disappointing campaign.",
      "It was why Ten Hag went so strong with his team selection and witnessed his side race into a two-goal lead inside the opening quarter of an hour.",
      "Fernandes did his best to remove the romance after seven minutes when receiving a ball from Shaw and finding Antony. The Brazilian played an instant return and Fernandes drilled a shot of rare purity past Nick Townsend within the blink of an eye.",
      "County fans, raucous at kick-off, were silenced and left despairing again as Diogo Dalot motored down the right to set up 18-year-old Mainoo, who carefully caressed his finish into the bottom corner.",
      "Garnacho might have made it worse but rattled the crossbar and Antony drifted in from the right flank to force Townsend to tip over.",
      "But County's recent cup pedigree - wins over Leicester and Leeds, as well as holding Tottenham to a Rodney Parade draw in 2018 - and a seven-game unbeaten run put United on notice they could not expect a smooth ride by the banks of the River Usk.",
      "Newport kept Bayindir honest with efforts from Evans and Ryan Delaney, but Morris' 36th-minute thunderbolt really came out of the blue.",
      "Morris, at Grimsby when the Mariners reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season, chested the ball down and unleashed from 25 yards to beat Bayindir with the help of a deflection off Martinez.",
      "Townsend denied Fernandes with the final kick of the first half and the importance of that save was underlined within two minutes of the restart.",
      "Striker Evans, who has gone from milking cows on the family farm to scoring FA Cup goals - will replay what happened next over and over again as his instinctive finish hauled Newport level.",
      "Raphael Varane was caught on his heels at the near post as the man from the Powys family farm - rejected at Shrewsbury - stole a march to finish beyond Bayindir. Evans has tasted European football at two Welsh Premiership clubs but having broken into the EFL, it was a moment he will cherish for the rest of his career.",
      "By now, Newport - 74 places below their visitors in the football pyramid and financial worlds apart - had one of the biggest upsets in the competition's 152-year history in their sights, but United dug deep and found extra resolve to wrestle back control.",
      "Harry Charsley drove wide, but the visitors retook the lead after 68 minutes as Shaw curled on to a post and Antony slotted the rebound.",
      "Harry Maguire was sent on late to preserve United's slender lead before Hojlund extended his scoring streak by pouncing on a loose ball and drilling home.",
      "Sky Sports' Ben Grounds:",
      "FA Cup glory would be a welcome boost for a club that is preparing to go through a big transition under INEOS, who are set to take control of football operations next month.",
      "Incoming minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a focus on improvements across the board and this competition could provide the platform for under-scrutiny Ten Hag to impress.",
      "United now have a kind-looking fifth-round assignment at either Bristol City or Nottingham Forest, but Ten Hag cannot allow any complacency to seep in.",
      "The return of Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro looked to have brought a calming influence before the chaos while Altay Bayindir looked assured on his debut. But there were very few tangible positives.",
      "Even Antony needed six attempts to get off the mark for the season and United's troubled season was in danger of sinking to a new low before Hojlund sealed matters in stoppage time.",
      "Ten Hag could almost feel the breath of home supporters standing just yards behind him and while this result does alleviate some of the pressure on him, this result and performance was far from convincing.",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag told BBC:",
      "\"First 35 minutes it was very comfortable. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0. They created no chance and then out of nothing - I think also it was a foul - they score.",
      "\"Then straight after half-time, a mistake, ours, defensive transition not great. Then you have to start again to win this game. Finally we did, so, boys, well done.\"",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes told BBC:",
      "\"We wanted to win, we got it. But the result wasn't the perfect one for us.",
      "\"The first one, it's a great goal from them. Unbelievable shot. But after we have to be more focused. In the second half, we can't concede another goal and let them have some belief.",
      "\"We have to kill the game. In the first half, we hand chances to make 3-0 but because when you get 2-0 in these kinds of games everyone wants to try to score and get their goal, sometimes we don't get the best decision for the team.",
      "\"After we did a great job to close the game.",
      "\"Our chance to win a trophy this season is the FA Cup and we have to give everything to get into the final. To make the season look not as bad as it's been, we have to try to win this trophy.\"",
      "Manchester United will now face the winners of the replay between Bristol City and Nottingham Forest in the fifth round.",
      "Swindon Town are next up at Rodney Parade for Newport County in League Two on Saturday February 3.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United play Wolves back in the Premier League on Thursday February 1."
