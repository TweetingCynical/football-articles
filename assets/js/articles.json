      "Marcus Rashford's future Manchester United remains unclear and he arrived at training eight minutes after Ruben Amorim departed - but the club claim this is not an unusual situation.",
      "The forward is back at the club for pre-season having spent the second part of the recent campaign at Aston Villa, whom he joined on loan after being frozen out in Manchester. Those at Villa Park opted against triggering their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "Rashford arrived at Carrington at 4.47pm on his own on Thursday, eight minutes after his head coach had departed. The MEN claims the 27-year-old has been training in the afternoons on an individual basis this week and his late arrival was just part of his schedule. Rashford arrived through the back gate entrance at Carrington, whilst Amorim used the front gate.",
      "The club have denied that the academy graduate was arriving at the club's training base to discuss his future, which remains unclear as he and Amorim still don't appear to see eye-to-eye after the United boss was a vocal critic of some of Rashford's behaviours when he first arrived.",
      "Rashford scored the first goal of the Amorim era when he notched in a draw Ipswich in late November, but quickly he saw his minutes decline. He was dropped for the Manchester derby at the Etihad and never found a way back.",
      "Amorim later claimed he would rather include one of the United coaches, who is into his 60s, on his bench instead of Rashford. He also criticised the forward's application in training and said they could not align their views on key issues.",
      "He said after sanctioning his loan exit: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different.\"",
      "In another telling sign that Rashford will be looking for a new club this summer he has seen his shirt number taken away - and he hasn't been handed a new one - after United decided to give the No10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Rashford last played for United against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on December 12. It is understood that the player's dream move would be to Barcelona, but so far they've pursued other targets. The likes of Newcastle have been credited with interest, but on loan, whilst the Manchester outfit want an end to the saga and would prefer a permanent exit.",

      "Antony, though, is still training away from United after spending the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis. The winger, who joined the Red Devils from Ajax for around £82million back in 2022, failed to make much of an impact at Old Trafford.",

      "The report adds that United want around £40m and Betis are willing to pay that in instalments, with an initial £20m paid up front this summer. When quizzed on Antony's future earlier this month, Betis president Angel Haro told Cope Sevilla that the move is dependent on \"on Manchester United, Antony and on Betis being willing to pay the transfer fee\".",
      "Haro said: \"We're talking to the player because coming to Betis entails a considerable reduction in salary, because we have to maintain our financial discipline and we don't want to break it.",
      "\"He's a fantastic player; he's given us a lot in the last six months, but we have to get everything right; we can't go crazy. We're working on that path because it's not easy. We're very imaginative when it comes to approaching this type of transaction, but it's complex.",
      "\"It involves the player, who loves Betis, but he also has to consider his own interests. We'll have to see if he comes; he's no longer here. We're working on that path; it won't be easy. Manchester [United] paid a significant amount, and he has two years left on his contract.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is \"very frustrated\" by the length of time that it is taking Manchester United to agree a deal with Brentford - who are digging their heels in when it comes to the player's price.",
      "Already the Red Devils have seen two bids for the forward rejected with the Bees wanting upwards of £60million before they consider cashing in. Mbeumo has just scored 20 times in the Premier League and could land a blockbuster move as a result.",
      "Those in Manchester have not yet returned with a third bid and the transfer saga is threatening to drag on, which doesn't suit any party. Ruben Amorim has identified Mbeumo as the type of player who can massively improve the club's forward line.",
      "Currently Matheus Cunha is the only man to head to Old Trafford this summer, leaving Wolves when his release clause was met. And Cameroon No 2, Ashu Cyprian Besong, has confessed that Mbeumo is particularly frustrated by how long the saga is beginning to drag on as he seeks to find a resolution over his future.",
      "Besong told Telecom Asia: “Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on.",
      "\"But of course, he’s already told them he wants to go to United. He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he’s very grateful for the opportunity that he’s been given by Brentford in his career.”",

Personal terms will not be an issue and it is now on the two clubs agreeing a fee. Brentford have previously sold their top talent, but only for the right price, and their director of football Phil Giles insists Mbeumo will stay at the club if their valuation is not met.",

He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",
      "Giles also maintained that Mbeumo would only be sold if it was \"the right deal\" for Brentford. He claimed: \"Any club will tell you that. If it's not right deal, why would we do it?\"",

      "Manchester United icon Nemanja Vidic has confessed he considered signing for arch-rivals Liverpool before his move to Old Trafford. Vidic had impressed at Spartak Moscow and was quickly snapped up by United for £7million in December 2005, officially joining the Red Devils a month later.",
      "The centre-back, who recently expressed his ambition to manage United one day, had been linked with a move to Old Trafford two years earlier. Vidic soon demonstrated why Sir Alex Ferguson had been a long-term admirer, establishing himself as one of the best defenders of the Premier League era.",
      "During his eight-and-a-half-year stint at United, Vidic won 10 major honours, including five Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008. However, Vidic had also caught the eye of Liverpool and another Premier League club before Ferguson swooped in to secure his services.",
      "\"Yes, we talked [with Liverpool boss Rafa Benítez] maybe once or twice, but nothing happened for two or three weeks,\" Vidic revealed on The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"David O'Leary wanted to bring me to Aston Villa too, but they didn't have the money. I had dinner with David O'Leary – he came to Moscow.\"",
      "However, Vidic's decision was straightforward once the United boss got in touch. \"Fergie just called me once and asked if I wanted to play for [Manchester] United, I said yes and that was done in four days,\" he recalled.",
      "Vidic made 15 appearances in the latter half of the 2005/06 season, but it was the subsequent campaign where he and Rio Ferdinand began to forge their iconic partnership, leading United to their first league title in four years. Having missed out on Vidic, Liverpool signed defenders Jan Kromkamp and Daniel Agger in the January window, while Villa struggled to a 16th-place finish.",
      "\"I was happy to go to Aston Villa, but they didn't have money at the time – that's what David O'Leary told me,\" Vidic explained. \"Liverpool were waiting too long, and Sir Alex Ferguson came in quickly and did the deal in four days.\"",
      "Vidic has admitted that the speed of his move to Old Trafford meant he forgot to mention his wage demands, which initially led him to take a pay cut for his big-money move to the Premier League. \"When I met him [Sir Alex Ferguson] was when I signed the contract with him and David Gill,\" Vidic admitted. \"The mistake I made at the time was that I said I wanted to play for United but I didn't say for how much money!",
      "\"For me at the time, it wasn't about the money – I wanted to test myself. If I wanted more money, it would've been better for me to stay in Moscow.",
      "\"I had double the money in Moscow than I did in Manchester when I came. Obviously, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill told me don't worry and that, this contract is just the beginning, and then if I played 50 games – it doesn't matter if it's 5 or 10 minutes – we'll change the contract. After 20-25 games, I signed a new contract.\"",
      "Ferguson improved United's defence through Vidic's arrival, marking another pivotal piece in his plan to overthrow Jose Mourinho's dominant Chelsea side. With Edwin van der Sar and Park Ji-sung signing months earlier and soon joined by Patrice Evra, Vidic would go on to form the backbone of United's success.",
      "Having been part of a successful United side, Vidic recently took aim at the club's failures in the post-Ferguson era. The 43-year-old blamed the huge wages paid to players and the lack of football expertise within the club's hierarchy during Ed Woodward's time as chief executive.",
      "Vidic was given the armband in 2010, lifting two league titles as captain. Upon signing Vidic, Ferguson declared: \"Good defenders win you things. This lad is really natural and athletic. You need good defenders and that is exactly what this lad is.\"",

      "The Europa League victors have kicked off their summer spending, having only signed Japanese prospect Kota Takai before this week, and sealed a £55million deal for the Hammers' Kudus on Thursday evening.",

      "Red Devils head coach Amorim has been handed a double blow in light of these moves, as he has shown admiration for both players in the past. Spurs have gotten their revenge after their efforts to sign Mbeumo were rebuffed, with the Cameroonian expressing his preference for United.",
      "Earlier in the year, United's interest in Gibbs-White was exposed by ex-chief scout Mick Brown, who disclosed Amorim's admiration for him, speaking to Football Insider.",

      "The Guardian also reported just last week that Kudus was on Amorim's list of potential attacking summer recruits, but the Ghanaian evidently chose Tottenham.",
      "While United's initial intrigue in Gibbs-White and Kudus waned as they pursued other offensive reinforcements, the club has successfully acquired Wolves ace Matheus Cunha for a lofty £62.5m and are still in negotiations over Mbeumo, whose price tag remains a sticking point, reports the Express.",
      "There are murmurs that Brentford may have underestimated Mbeumo's worth, particularly after Forest accepted a whopping £55m bid for Anthony Elanga and with Chelsea's Noni Madueke set to join Arsenal for more than £50m.",
      "According to the Evening Standard, after a 20-goal haul in last season's Premier League, Brentford believe their £63m valuation of Mbeumo might be on the low side. This spells potential trouble for United, who are eager for a team overhaul but must stay within PSR parameters.",

      "For a while, it was an open secret but during the last international break, Thomas Tuchel confirmed one of the main reasons why Jordan Henderson is a key member of his England squad. Tuchel is satisfied 35-year-old Henderson can still do a job on the pitch at elite level but, just as importantly, he believes the former Liverpool captain is a leader off the field.",
      "“He is a very important addition to this group,” Tuchel said. “Especially when we talk about setting standards and keeping the group up to standards.”",
      "Those remarks came after a painful 1-0 win over mighty Andorra and a 3-1 loss to Senegal, so judgement on how Tuchel’s reasoning is working out should be put on hold. But Tuchel is not the only manager to value Henderson’s attitude to dressing-room culture.",
      "“What makes a footballer?” Jurgen Klopp once asked. “Is it talent? Or is it the attitude? Well, it is having the perfect mix. And Hendo is the answer to that.”",
      "That was some time back and, since then, Henderson left for Saudi Arabia before going to Ajax. The move to Al-Ettifaq was a deeply ill-advised one, professionally and personally.",
      "Seemingly a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, that was one obvious reason why he should have resisted the move and, on a playing level, it was too early to leave elite European football. His time at Ajax has not been without controversy - there was a tale about him wanting to walk out for a move to Monaco, which he denied - but he has played to a decent level, appearing 57 times and captaining the club.",
      "And while Tuchel has been pilloried by many - including myself - for starting Henderson in some of his line-ups, you have to be fair and say the veteran has done okay in his international second coming. But does 35 count as 'veteran'? Not in modern football. You all know the examples - no need to list them.",
      "Henderson looks fit and lean and gets about the pitch as well as anybody in an England shirt. And now, he is available without a fee, Ajax having agreed to terminate his contract.",
      "Someone, somewhere, is going to get a great free transfer. It won’t be Manchester United.",
      "There is the deep Liverpool connection, for a start and even if Ruben Amorim liked him, imagine how it would go down with the fans. But perhaps Amorim needs someone like Henderson to sort out a dressing-room that has been plagued by under-performing prima donnas.",
      "Imagine how Henderson would have dealt with the tantrums of Alejandro Garnacho or how he would have tried to sort out Marcus Rashford if he thought he was not pulling his weight. It is not going to happen but Henderson is the sort of character the Manchester United dressing-room needs.",
      "If he ends up at a Premier League club, Henderson will not be an automatic starter, no matter which one of the 20 is his destination. And he will know that.",
      "But you won’t just be getting a very decent squad player, you will be getting a leader who stands for no nonsense on the training pitch or in the dressing-room. And if you don’t believe that, ask Thomas Tuchel.",

There are now just five weeks until the start of United's Premier League season, on August 17, meaning the clock is ticking. Here are the latest headlines involving the club.",

      "“It’s difficult to be at United now, to be a football player or the owner – whatever you do, it’s difficult so if you want to change the club, the club has to bring in the characters. If the characters aren’t in the club, it is difficult, and you will go through this situation.",
      "“If you bring in people who are going to be nice, smiling, and saying things that you want to hear, I don’t think that’s the way forward. You need people who will take responsibility and be strong enough to say the things they see, even if they have to deal with the consequences.”",
      "Vidic, who took his coaching badges while playing for United but who has so far resisted the lure of returning to work in football, claimed players have too much power these days, which makes it even harder for managers.",
      "“Football players have too much power and because of the money involved, the owner respects the opinion of an agent and player more than the manager,” said Vidic. “That’s the issue we have now. If you have a strong character and personality and have a conflict with a player now, I think the coach will be the one to leave the club.",
      "“This is the era of a new generation of a manager who needs to be careful with how they talk to players – to be a psychologist. You cannot treat all players the same, or owners, and fans. Sir Alex Ferguson was great at this, but it’s even more difficult now.”",
      "Nemana Vidic was speaking on The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Rio Ferdinand has issued a stark warning to Manchester United's hierarchy, urging them to snap up Bryan Mbeumo this summer or risk embarrassment. The Brentford sensation has been a key target for the Red Devils since the summer transfer window opened up last month.",
      "However, the journey to securing Mbeumo's services has been far from plain sailing, given United have already seen two initial bids for the 25-year-old rebuffed by the Bees after failing to meet their valuation. Now the Old Trafford top brass are set to launch an improved third offer exceeding £60million to finally get a deal over the line - although there's no guarantee Brentford will agree to sell at the new price.",
      "Ferdinand, whose time at United spanned an impressive 12 years from 2002 to 2014, has labelled securing Mbeumo an essential move ahead of the upcoming campaign to stave off potential ridicule. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the ex-defensive stalwart said: \"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United.",
      "\"So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn't seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",
      "\"We haven't heard, really, any other names that it seems to be getting close with. So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant.",
      "\"It's gone public, they've allowed that to happen, and they're in a position now where they've got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.\"",
      "On why Mbeumo is a top fit for the club, Ferdinand added: \"He fits the bill for me physically. He's dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.\"",
      "Regarding Brentford's stance, the club reportedly want at least £65m to let their star winger leave this summer. Director of football Phil Giles has said on the matter: \"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised. He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer. If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Mbeumo had a stellar 2024/25 season with the Bees, netting 20 goals and setting up eight more in 38 Premier League games. As his contract with the club runs until next summer, with an option for Brentford to extend it for another year, the board are not under pressure to sell unless they receive an offer that meets their valuation for the Cameroon international.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "As things stand, Newcastle have not returned to make a move for Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi, with Liverpool still among the favourites for his signature. The Chronicle report that the Magpies are monitoring Guehi's situation from afar after missing out on the defender last summer.",
      "The possibility of revisiting the negotiating table has not been ruled out but for the moment, the Reds appear to have a clear run. Though, there have been concerns over the fee the Eagles want for Guehi, despite just having one year remaining on his contract.",
      "Parma and former Arsenal coach Carlos Cueta are understood to have made initial enquiries over the potential signing of attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira. The Portugal international has failed to break into Arsenal plans after arriving at the Emirates in 2020 in a deal worth up to £34.2m",
      "Vieira recently returned to the club following a season-long loan at Porto. The 25-year-old looks likely to depart this summer.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is \"very frustrated\" by the length of time that it is taking Manchester United to agree a deal with Brentford - who are digging their heels in when it comes to the player's price.",
      "Already the Red Devils have seen two bids for the forward rejected with the Bees wanting upwards of £60million before they consider cashing in. Those in Manchester have not yet returned with a third bid and the transfer saga is threatening to drag on,",
      "Cameroon assistant boss, Ashu Cyprian Besong, has confessed that Mbeumo is particularly frustrated by how long the saga is beginning to drag on.",
      "Besong told Telecom Asia: “Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on. But of course, he’s already told them he wants to go to United. He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he’s very grateful for the opportunity that he’s been given by Brentford in his career.”",

      "Real Madrid have made it clear that they want more than £80m before they consider selling Rodrygo as Arsenal continue to circle for the Brazilian.",
      "The forward has been linked with a move away from the Spanish giants and his involvement has massively declined this summer. Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jnr are talismans for Real but Rodrygo has seen his minutes drop off. Earlier this week, when Real were humbled 4-0 by PSG in the Club World Cup semi-finals, the Brazilian remained on the bench for the fifth consecutive match.",
      "There is heavy talk surrounding his possible exit, Real though won't let him go on the cheap with UOL Esporte in Brazil claiming they want offers of around €100m (£86m) before they consider letting Rodrygo leave the Bernabeu.",

      "According to Sports Digitale via Football Italia, negotiations with both sides are not going to plan. It is suggested that Napoli are concerned that they don't have a guarantee from the Turkish side over a prompt payment.",

      "The summer transfer window was just 14 hours old when Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha on June 1.",
      "United triggered the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause and his move to Old Trafford was subject to him obtaining a visa and registration. The deal was officially completed 11 days later.",
      "During that brief waiting period, United also tabled an opening offer for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo after learning he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer. Their opening bid, worth £55m, was swiftly rejected.",
      "United returned with another bid last month, understood to be in excess of £60m, and it appeared as though that would be enough to make the Cameroon international their second summer signing. However, negotiations remain ongoing and supporters are becoming frustrated.",
      "United are treading a fine line between attempting to strengthen the squad and avoid paying over the odds this summer. Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last summer and Brentford are within their rights to hold out for as high a price as possible.",
      "As much as United want Mbeumo and as much as he wants to move to M16, the Reds must remain mindful that the clock is ticking. The start of their pre-season tour is just a fortnight away and the start of the new Premier League season will be here before you know it.",
      "Having first made contact with Brentford just over five weeks ago, United have got themselves involved in an unwanted saga. They wanted to sign Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training and that deadline has been and gone.",
      "With little progress being made on other fronts, United's fast start to the window is becoming a distant memory. Ruben Amorim's side finished 15th in the Premier League last season and the Portuguese chief is desperate to add fresh blood to his squad.",
      "What makes matters worse for United and their supporters is what is happening elsewhere. After Liverpool and Manchester City made storming starts to the window, signing the likes of Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki, Tottenham Hotspur are now flexing their muscless.",
      "They completed the £55m signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham United on Thursday evening and are reportedly closing in on the signing of Nottingham Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White after triggering his £60m release clause.",
      "Arsenal are also greasing their wheels. After adding Christian Norgaard to the signings of Kepa Arrizabalaga and Martin Zubimendi earlier this week, they are now closing in on the signing of Chelsea winger Noni Madueke. Chelsea, too, have been very busy.",
      "Circumstances at every club differ, not least financially, and it is no secret United are having to sell in order to buy this summer. That situation is making the task of bringing new faces in much harder.",
      "Nevertheless, when supporters glance at the business being conducted by the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, City and Spurs, they are naturally going to become restless and frustrated.",
      "United were dreadful last season, offering very little in the way of positives, meaning they have no choice but to make the most of this summer's window. It is the most important summer they have faced in their modern history.",
      "You cannot dismiss the fact United have spent more than £60m on Cunha, a proven Premier League operator who is tailor-made for Amorim's system. They also deserve plaudits for persevering with their quest to sign Mbeumo, who was the fourth-highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season.",
      "However, as mid-July approaches, supporters can be forgiven for becoming impatient. Other Premier League clubs, many of whom enjoyed a far better season than the Reds did last term, are cracking on with their business at a decent pace.",
      "Spurs' recent movements have been the tipping point for many, forcing some supporters to pick up their phones and express their feelings on social media. The prospect of signing Kudus and Gibbs-White in the same week is one way to make a statement.",
      "It would be fantastic to see Mbeumo start the new season in United colours, and many believe the situation has come too far for that not to happen, but the longer this particular saga goes on, United are at an increased risk of being left behind."

      "Erik ten Hag spoke to reporters who travelled to Norway for United's opening pre-season friendly last summer and took a few minutes to speak again in the Murrayfield tunnel in Edinburgh.",
      "Those encounters gave journalists the chance to probe Ten Hag on the summer transfer window, which gave updates to supporters. It's hoped the same face time will be afforded with Amorim before the tour of the United States because it will be fascinating to hear his thoughts so far.",
      "The chances are Amorim won't be happy. Cunha should be a tremendous addition, but he needs more fresh blood through the door and the club are dangerously close to letting him down.",
      "After facing Leeds, United will travel to the USA for the Premier League Summer Series and it's imperative at least one signing - hopefully Mbeumo - is included in that travelling squad.",
      "Ideally, two more signings would be on the plane to face West Ham in New Jersey, although fans would probably settle for seeing Mbeumo travel over the Atlantic at this stage.",
      "It has now been more than a month since the opening bid for Mbeumo was submitted. The subsequent bid was rejected and United should walk away from the deal if a third proposal is knocked back.",
      "Having said that, the feeling is that Mbeumo should be a United player by the time of the USA tour. And if that doesn't happen, it will truly be time for the alarm bells to start ringing.",
      "United need to push through a handful of sales to raise funds for further incoming. The futures of Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia must be addressed as a priority because they will unlock funds.",
      "Amorim needs to give his side a major makeover and he's been given a touch of lipstick so far. The new season could get ugly again if new signings aren't given time to work with Amorim in pre-season."

      "With just over two weeks to go until the opening game of Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States, time is running out to get new signings through the door ahead of crossing the Atlantic.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves nice and early last month, United immediately turned their attention to trying to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite making two offers, the second of which was in excess of £60million, United are yet to reach an agreement with the Bees. It means some supporters are becoming frustrated and restless.",
      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last term, United went into this summer's window knowing the scale of the changes that needed to be made. They have prioritised attacking signings and the prospect of heading to the US with Cunha and Mbeumo in the bank would be fantastic.",
      "In addition to trying to sign Cunha and Mbeumo, United also want a centre-forward. But after Liam Delap joined Chelsea last month, their striker search is yet to provide an answer.",
      "There is a strong chance United's search for a No.9 will still be active by the time the Premier League season starts in mid-August. United had to wait until the final day of last summer's window to recruit Manuel Ugarte, who was drafted in to fix their biggest problem position.",
      "With their pursuit of Mbeumo still ongoing, United are highly unlikely to get him and a striker through the door ahead of the opening game of the Premier League Summer Series against West Ham United in New Jersey on July 27.",
      "It means the responsibility of leading United's attack in the US is likely to rest on the shoulders of either Rasmus Hojlund or Chido Obi. The former has not had a full pre-season at United after arriving too late in August 2023 and getting injured in the first game of last summer's tour.",
      "Obi, too, has not had a pre-season since joining United. He joined the club last September and had to go through what was essentially an individual pre-season before being unleashed for the Under-18s and later graduating to the first-team.",
      "Hojlund scored just ten goals last season, meaning justifiable doubts have been raised about him leading United's attack in 2025/26. The Reds are open to selling him and Inter Milan have expressed interest in his signature.",
      "Hojlund has regressed since joining United and a lot of supporters have given up on him. There is no doubt the club needs to recruit a new starting striker this summer.",
      "But until United oversee a crop of sales, they will be unable to fund the addition of a No.9 amid the £62.5m signing of Cunha and the ongoing pursuit of Mbeumo. United will also owe £89m on signings from previous windows this summer.",
      "With patience required, Obi will be looking to make his mark in pre-season and potentially leapfrog Hojlund in the pecking order in the race to become Amorim's first-choice No.9 in the US.",
      "The talented 17-year-old ended last season on a positive note, scoring two goals in United's 3-1 win over Hong Kong on the post-season tour. It goes without saying the outcome of that match meant nothing and the second half goals Obi plundered have not even made the record books.",
      "However, the Danish youth international demonstrated in that second half that he has the natural instincts all good strikers need to have. His opener saw him swivel inside the box and fire home an instinctive finish before he anticipated a Mason Mount cross to head home his second.",
      "His movement to ensure he was in the right place at the right time was down to his natural instincts, which is something that can be rarely taught on the training ground.",
      "It must be stressed that this is not an argument for Obi to become United's main striker come the start of the season. There is an obvious need for the Reds to recruit an established goalscorer to spearhead their attack this summer.",
      "But with their striker search no closer to being solved, Amorim could throw caution to the wind in pre-season and look ahead to United's long-term future by giving Obi the nod.",
      "What is the worst that can happen?"

      "Ruben Amorim's men are back in pre-season training at Carrington as preparations for the 2025/26 get underway. However, there remains a big focus on United's transfer business.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves for £62.5million but the Reds have struggled to get a deal over the line for Bryan Mbeumo. Two bids have been turned down by Brentford and a third bid has been tipped.",
      "Alongside the 25-year-old, United are also exploring the possibility of signing a new striker. A move for Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres has been mentioned for the majority of the summer but Amorim is facing being short on options.",
      "Free agents Jamie Vardy, Callum Wilson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin have all reportedly been offered to United. A move for either is expected to only be sanctioned closer to the end of the window, if other top targets aren't signed.",
      "Keep across all the latest United transfer news and analysis in our live blog updates below...",
      "Real Madrid have rejected a £78million bid from Manchester United for Aurelien Tchouameni, according to Spanish journalist Eduardo Inda.",
      "United have been tracking Tchouameni's progress and are keen to strengthen their midfield following the departure of Christian Eriksen. The Frenchman would be a strong addition.",
      "Barcelona are prepared to go 'all-in' to sign Marcus Rashford from Manchester United this summer, as per Sky Germany.",
      "Journalist Florian Plettenberg said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday morning: \"As revealed on 6 July, the priority for FC Barcelona is Marcus #Rashford. Barca want to try again for Rashford and are prepared to go all-in.\"",
      "Plettenberg added: \"Rashford is now the clear number one target. Talks are ongoing. Green light from Hansi Flick was already given days ago. The 27-year-old winger is set to leave Manchester United.\"",
      "Rashford scored four times and provided six assists in 17 appearances during a loan spell at Aston Villa last season. He is one of five United players that have informed the club of his desire to explore different opportunities this summer.",
      "Manchester United have reached a 'basic agreement' with Juventus regarding the transfer of Jadon Sancho, according to La Stampa.",
      "Sancho, 25, has given the greenlight to make the move to Turin, with United agreeing to sell him in a deal worth around £17.2million.",
      "The England international, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, is expected to sign a long-term contract and earn £5.1m per year at Juventus.",
      "Manchester United are open to allowing Andre Onana to leave the club for as a little as £30million this summer, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "Monaco enquired about the possibility of signing the Cameroon international and £30m was the figure that United put forward, as they look to cash in on the goalkeeper.",
      "If the Reds decided to sell for that price, it would represent a significant financial hit on the £47m they paid Inter Milan to sign Onana two years ago.",
      "Manchester United have enquired about a potential move for Southampton star Tyler Dibling, according to The Sun. The 19-year-old impressed during his breakthrough Premier League season in 2024/25.",
      "However, Saints value the teenager at £47million. As well as United, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and West Ham are keen on signing the wide forward.",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford drove into Carrington on Thursday to train on his own again. Rashford, 27, arrived at Carrington at 4.47pm, eight minutes after Ruben Amorim had departed.",
      "United sources have denied Rashford was attending Carrington to discuss his future and said the 27-year-old has been training in the afternoons on an individual basis this week.",
      "Rashford arrived through the back gate entrance at Carrington, and Amorim used the front gate.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United are considering a summer swoop for Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is available as a free agent after leaving Everton at the end of last month, according to CaughtOffside.",
      "Calvert-Lewin, 28, scored just three goals in 26 Premier League appearances last season and it's claimed he is a 'serious' target for United, but wages could prove to be an issue.",
      "Calvert-Lewin is expected to ask for around £100,000 per week - a demand that could come as too expensive for the Reds.",
      "Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi is Manchester United's top target for that position, according to reports in Italy.",
      "He made 44 appearances in all competitions last season and kept 18 clean sheets - 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League.",
      "However, any deal for Carnesecchi may be dependent on Andre Onana's future and a move for the Cameroonian.",
      "According to 90min.com, Juventus are keen to offload Dusan Vlahovic this summer and Manchester United are showing interest.",
      "It's added that United may have the edge after opening talks over a swap deal involving out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Vlahovic, 25, scored 17 goals in 44 appearances during the 2024/25 season and netted against Manchester City at the Club World Cup.",

      "Stay tuned for the latest throughout the day from Old Trafford...",

      "We will be back again bright and early tomorrow bringing you more updates from Old Trafford.",
      "Until then, take care of yourselves and good night.",
      "After a cryptic post on social media of himself on a private jet with the simple caption: \"Coming,\" it appears Garnacho is free to train with the Reds' first-team.",
      "Despite being told by Amorim that he is free to find a new club this summer, ESPN understands that the Argentine will not be blocked from training with his teammates when he returns to Carrington.",
      "Garnacho is one of five players who informed United that he wished to sign for another club in the summer transfer window. He was therefore given an extended break to try and facilitate a deal elsewhere.",
      "It is hard to argue against what Ferdinand is saying about Mbeumo.",
      "United have got themselves too deep into this saga not to sign the Cameroonian now.",
      "Not signing Mbeumo would be a huge come down for the Reds and risks being a very bad start to the summer transfer window.",
      "Tomorrow, there will be 37 days remaining until the start of the Premier League season and United have only made one major signing...",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Rio Ferdinand has insisted that United have little choice but to meet Brentford's valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "United need to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. The proposal doesn't seem to be enough for Brentford, but Manchester United need to get this done. It's been in the news for far too long, to get to a situation to get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen, I think that will be an egg-on-the-face situation for Man United unless they go and get someone else. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? We haven't heard any names that are close.",
      "Despite these reports of a delay in negotiations between Napoli and Galatasaray for Osimhen, it seems this ship has sailed for United.",
      "The Reds are still focused on Mbeumo and that could be to their detriment.",
      "Osimhen will be given a hero's welcome back to Istanbul should he complete this move and you have to think that United could have missed a trick.",
      "According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Napoli have paused transfer talks with Galatasaray for Victor Osimhen.",
      "It is understood that there has been a delay to the move due to Gala's current inability to provide 'bank guarantees'.",
      "As such, the talks have been halted until these guarantees have been met.",
      "United confirmed this afternoon that young defender Sonny Aljofree has left the club to join Notts County on loan.",
      "The 20-year-old made 25 appearances for Accrington Stanley last season in League Two and he returns to that level with the Nottinghamshire club.",
      "In 2022, Aljofree starred alongside Garnacho and Mainoo as the young Reds won the Youth Cup.",
      "According to Sport, Antony has a burning desire to sign for Real Betis in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is understood that there is currently no agreement in place with the Seville club at this stage.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Antony is one of five players who has told the club he wants to leave this summer.",
      "Real Betis are reportedly confident enough that Antony wants to sign for them that they are willing to drag the saga into the final stages of the window to force United's hand.",
      "According to Cameroon's assistant Ashu Cyprian Besong, Mbeumo is growing increasingly frustrated by the lack of movement in the switch to United.",
      "Speaking to Telecom Asia, Besong said:",
      "Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on. But of course, he’s already told them he wants to go to United. He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he’s very grateful for the opportunity that he’s been given by Brentford in his career.",
      "It is being reported this evening that Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White is set for a medical at Tottenham after Spurs activated his release clause.",
      "With that, David Ornstein reports that Forest have renewed their interest in Brentford's Yoane Wissa and with money coming in for both Gibbs-White and Elanga, the east Midlands club have money to spend.",
      "Yesterday we brought you news that the Bees are only willing to allow one of Wissa or Mbeumo to leave this summer.",
      "At the moment, there has yet to be a breakthrough in negotiations with Brentford for Mbeumo so Forest's interest in Wissa could be a concern.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with several potential new signings as the summer transfer window rolls on.",
      "One area of the pitch that has become the centre of the transfer speculation is at centre forward. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are the current striker options at United, but there are rumours that there could be new additions to the position at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha has been signed from Wolves, with the £62.5million new addition also capable of performing in a centre forward role.",
      "United had hoped to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town this summer, but the striker instead chosen to join Chelsea in a £30million deal. As a result, United have been looking at alternate options for the centre forward position, with a host of players being linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "The England international, 27, spent last season on loan at Aston Villa - after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and his time at the club appears to be drawing to an end. Rashford is reportedly keen on a move to La Liga side Barcelona, who are looking to bolster their forward line.",
      "Barca's recent move for Nico Williams appeared to end any pursuit of the United forward, only for a dramatic twist which saw the Spanish international agree new terms with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "It's re-opened the door for Rashford, who is still pushing for an exit from United, though recent reports may have handed him yet another blow. Hansi Flick's team have also been linked with a move for Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, along with Bayern Munich and clubs in Saudi Arabia.",

      "He has since given an update on talks, posting on X: \"The path is clear for Victor Osimhen to join Galatasaray. As explained yesterday, the player is pushing for Napoli to accept a deal with the Turkish club. Al Hilal FC is out of the race. Everything is in place to finalize the move.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho could be handed a surprise exit route out of Manchester United this summer, but it would require a favour from rivals Liverpool.",
      "Having spent last season on loan at Chelsea, the out-of-favour 25-year-old is expected to leave Old Trafford on a permanent basis this summer. Sancho is one of five United players granted extra time off to find a new club, with Serie A giants Juventus rumoured to be among his suitors.",
      "However, the latest reports from Germany suggest another possible exit route could be on the cards, and it’s not his former club. Sancho was signed from Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund in 2021 and spent the second half of the 2023/24 season back there on loan.",
      "According to outlet TZ, Sancho could be a target for Bayern Munich this summer as they look to bolster their left-wing options following the departure of Leroy Sane. Given the player's prior Bundesliga experience and relatively low asking price compared to other targets, he could represent a strong option for Vincent Kompany.",
      "The report also notes that Bayern were among the top European clubs interested in Sancho prior to his return to England, but it was United who eventually won the race for the winger. Now, he could be available to Bayern at a reasonable fee as the Manchester club look to offload players deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "However, other reports in Germany claim Liverpool's Luis Diaz is Bayern’s priority target this summer, after they missed out on Nico Williams, who ultimately extended his contract at Athletic Club. That said, Liverpool have twice rejected approaches from Barcelona and Bayern for Diaz this summer, according to the BBC, and insist he is not for sale, despite only having two years left on his deal at Anfield.",
      "Should Liverpool remain firm in their stance on the Colombian, Bayern will be forced to consider alternative targets. If reports are to be believed that Sancho is among them, it could provide a promising exit route for the United man."

      "Martinez has been at Villa for almost five years, having joined the club from Premier League side Arsenal in 2020. While he only made 38 appearances for the Gunners during his 10 years at the club, he has since established himself as a key figure at Villa Park, amassing over 200 appearances across all competitions.",
      "The World Cup winner still has four years remaining on his current deal with Villa, but some reports this summer have suggested the club would be open to a sale for the right price in an effort to reduce their wage bill, leading to rumoured interest from the likes of United and clubs in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Now, if the latest reports are to be believed, Villa are closing in on the signing of Dutch goalkeeper Marco Bizot. According to The Mirror, the 34-year-old is set to join from Ligue 1 side Brest and is eager to test himself in the Premier League.",
      "The report notes that Villa are in the market for a new goalkeeper due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding Martinez’s future, as well as the departure of their no.2, Robin Olsen, who left as a free agent earlier this summer. With Villa covering their bases, it remains to be seen whether Bizot’s arrival could pave the way for Martinez’s exit.",
      "The Argentina star addressed his future while away with his national team earlier this summer, telling reporters: “My future? I don’t know. I come here to play for the national team, and that’s the only thing that matters to me right now.",
      "“Do I want to move to a new club? The transfer window just opened, so there’s still a long way to go.”"

      "Manchester United legend Nemanja Vidic has revealed how close he came to joining the club’s bitter rivals Liverpool before his move to Old Trafford.",
      "Vidic was snapped up from Spartak Moscow for £7million in December 2005 and officially joined the club a month later. The centre-back, who recently confessed his desire to become United boss in the future, had been linked with a move to Old Trafford two years earlier and soon proved why Sir Alex Ferguson had been a long-term fan of the defender.",
      "He would go on to win 10 major honours during his eight-and-a-half years at United, including five Premier League titles and clinching the Champions League in 2008. However, Vidic has admitted that he had attracted interest from Liverpool and another Premier League side before Ferguson acted decisively to bring him to United.",
      "“Yes, we talked [with Rafa Benítez] maybe once or twice, but nothing happened for two or three weeks,” Vidic told The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet. “David O’Leary wanted to bring me to Aston Villa too, but they didn’t have the money. I had dinner with David O’Leary – he came to Moscow.”",
      "However, the decision was simple for Vidic once the United boss had contacted him. “Fergie just called me once and asked if I wanted to play for [Manchester] United, I said yes and that was done in four days,\" he said.",
      "Vidic made 15 appearances in the second half of the 2005/06 campaign, but it was the following season that his partnership with Rio Ferdinand began to flourish as the team won the league title for the first time in four years. Meanwhile, it was a case of what could have been for rivals Liverpool, who signed defenders Jan Kromkamp and Daniel Agger in the January window, and a struggling Villa side.",
      "“I was happy to go to Aston Villa, but they didn’t have money at the time – that’s what David O’Leary told me,” Vidic explained. “Liverpool were waiting too long, and Sir Alex Ferguson came in quickly and did the deal in four days.",
      "“When I met him [Sir Alex Ferguson] was when I signed the contract with him and David Gill. The mistake I made at the time was that I said I wanted to play for United but I didn’t say for how much money!”",
      "Remarkably, Vidic revealed that his first United contract was worth half of what he was earning at Spartak Moscow, though this was soon rectified. “For me at the time, it wasn’t about the money – I wanted to test myself,” he said. “If I wanted more money, it would’ve been better for me to stay in Moscow.",
      "“I had double the money in Moscow than I did in Manchester when I came. Obviously, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill told me don’t worry and that, this contract is just the beginning, and then if I played 50 games – it doesn’t matter if it’s 5 or 10 minutes – we’ll change the contract. After 20-25 games, I signed a new contract.”",
      "The arrival of Vidic marked another important step towards the new side Ferguson was forming to challenge Chelsea’s recent dominance under Jose Mourinho. The club had already signed Edwin van der Sar and Park Ji-sung that summer, with Patrice Evra joining alongside Vidic in January 2006. The Serbian defender became club captain in 2010, leading United to two league titles as skipper.",
      "After the signing of Vidic was announced, Ferguson said: \"Good defenders win you things. This lad is really natural and athletic. You need good defenders and that is exactly what this lad is.\""

      "It was the perfect opportunity for Harry Amass to be given his competitive debut. He impressed on last summer's pre-season tour, producing a crop of eye-catching performances, and the stage was set for him to make his Old Trafford bow.",
      "Instead, Collyer - a central-midfielder - started on the left of the back four. The decision did not go down well.",
      "Left-back was often Ten Hag's blind spot. The signing of Tyrell Malacia was questioned, the loan addition of Sergio Reguilon aged terribly, and the Dutchman even tested the water by deploying defensive-midfielder Sofyan Amrabat in that role.",
      "On the same day United signed Reguilon and Amrabat on loan from Tottenham Hotspur and Fiorentina respectively, Alvaro Carreras was sent out on loan to Granada. He had spent the previous season on loan at Preston North End, winning their 2022/23 Young Player of the Season award.",
      "His performances in the Championship at Deepdale often earned plaudits from North End supporters. Many felt he was destined to go onto achieve bigger and better things.",
      "United felt the most logical next step in his career was to send him to Granada, who had just been promoted back to La Liga. He struggled for game time in Spain and moved to Benfica in January, signing on loan for the remainder of the season.",
      "The attack-minded full-back, who is equally capable as a wing-back, got into his stride in Portugal and made 16 appearances, scoring one goal. His performances convinced Benfica to sign him on a permanent basis in May last year.",
      "They triggered the option to turn his stay into a permanent one, and United banked a guaranteed payment of around £5million. At the time, it felt like a good deal for United, as they secured a cash-injection for a player that had never made a first-team appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "On the flip side, United said farewell to a promising defender who had done more than enough during his time at Preston and Benfica to suggest he had something about him. That something has now put him on the cusp of a move to Real Madrid.",
      "The Spanish club has been tracking Carreras' signature for a while and it now appears as though a deal is closer than ever to coming to fruition. It has been reported that he is closing in on a move to the Bernabeu for £43m.",
      "Wisely, United inserted a sell-on clause into the deal that took Carreras to Benfica. They also inserted a buy-back clause which is understood to be active until the summer of 2026, allowing them to re-sign him for around £16m.",
      "United are understood to be in line to receive 20 per cent of the profit Benfica make on the Spaniard, meaning, they will secure a little under £6m.",
      "With the club in desperate need of cash this summer, every revenue stream will be welcomed. However, it is impossible to turn a blind eye to how badly this situation has aged for United.",
      "Carreras established himself as a regular starter for Benfica last term, making 52 appearances, scoring four goals and contributing five assists. He made ten appearances in the Champions League and did not look out of place.",
      "As a result of his performances at the highest level, Madrid are now making progress in their quest to sign him. His attacking nature allows him to play pretty much anywhere down the left, meaning he has versatile qualities Madrid will welcome with open arms.",
      "Their pursuit of him will benefit United financially, but Ten Hag's refusal to give him a chance has left them short of a quality player on the pitch who could have so easily excelled in Ruben Amorim's system."

      "With the width in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation being provided by the wing-backs, Cunha will be expected to operate in central areas and get as close to Rasmus Hojlund, or whoever else may end up spearheading United's attack, in support.",
      "Playing in the left channel, albeit tucked in, Cunha will find himself having to develop a rapport with Patrick Dorgu. The Dane arrived at Old Trafford from Lecce earlier this year and will be hoping to kick on after a first pre-season at United.",
      "Despite producing some up and down performances, you cannot lose sight of the fact Dorgu arrived at Old Trafford as a raw 20-year-old who had never experienced playing for a club of United's stature before. Furthermore, he was thrown straight into the starting XI with the task of operating in one of the most important and demanding positions in Amorim's system.",
      "He was never going to be inch-perfect, especially when walking into a team midway through the season that was struggling. With a full pre-season under his belt, Dorgu has the potential to improve.",
      "He does not turn 21 until October, meaning he is still quite some way from entering a period in his career where he should be described as the finished product. He is learning on the job and his development is in progress.",
      "Expected to remain United's first-choice left wing-back ahead of the upcoming season, Dorgu could find himself working in tandem with Cunha. The pair of them are likely to be tasked with linking up on the left and the former will be expected to provide width and overlapping runs.",
      "The development of their partnership could play a key role in Amorim's masterplan coming to fruition. Both players have been signed to fit his system and are expected to forge long and successful careers at Old Trafford.",
      "United's upcoming pre-season campaign could be the birth of their on-field relationship."

      "Caught Offside have reported that United are still interested in signing the England international, but will apparently have to sell at least one star to make room in their squad.",

So it’s not only Rashford who wants to leave United but there is also United who are pushing the opportunity to sell Marcus Rashford or to find a solution for him this summer.",
      "“When I say Man United it’s the management, it’s the coach Ruben Amorim. So all parties are going to the same direction for Marcus Rashford to leave.”",

      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nDespite speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao, many reports suggest a deal has been agreed with United and it’s now down to Sancho to decide if how much he might be prepared to sacrifice to kickstart his career. The signs so far: not much…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "11) Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",

      "The Gunners have been hard at work attempting to convince the Portuguese club to sell the Sweden international on their terms but Sporting are holding firm.",
      "There are claims that Arsenal are prepared to pay the €80m that Sporting are asking for but it’s the fixed fee that is forming the problem in negotiations.",
      "It is understood that the Gunners are looking to pay €65m as a fixed amount with €15m more in bonuses, while Sporting are holding out for €70m fixed.",
      "The Daily Mirror claim that Arsenal were given a ‘cooling off period’ by the Portuguese club ‘after reaching stalemate’ in transfer talks.",
      "But Sporting ‘now ready to resume serious negotiations within the next 48 hours but have so far stuck to their guns over the price as they want around £70m with at least £60m up front and the rest in add-ons’.",

      "However, football transfer journalist Ben Jacobs revealed that Gyokeres was open to a move to Man Utd despite no European football on offer next season.",
      "And Jacobs still insists that Gyokeres “remains open” to a move to Man Utd if he can’t complete a deal to sign for Arsenal in the summer.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “Viktor Gyokeres never said no to Manchester United. He was, still is, if something falls through, open to joining Manchester United without Champions League football.",
      "“And that’s the part that always gets pulled out of context on social media, and suddenly you get told you’re saying it’s advancing, but Gyokeres indicating that, never meant that Manchester United made an approach to Sporting.”",
      "Jacobs added: “So we’ve never had yet a Manchester United conversation with Sporting. No bid. It’s never advanced further than the player camp simply saying, if Arsenal doesn’t come off, we would also be open to Manchester United.",
      "“And the ball has always been in Manchester United’s court and they’ve not escalated that to any kind of club-to-club talks. So, it’s never been anything to get over excited about other than the fact that if this Arsenal deal doesn’t come off, Gyokeres wants to move to the Premier League and remains open to Manchester United.”",

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer.

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",

Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker left the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",

      "Mohammed Kudus – £55m in July 2025",
      "From: West Ham (14th)\nTo: Spurs (17th)",
      "It is an unflattering reflection of both club and player that Kudus signed a West Ham contract containing an £80m release clause in summer 2023 and left for £25m less two years later.",
      "There were flashes of something exceptional over those 80 Hammers appearances under three different managers, but that wonderful first season being shown tapes of Steven Pienaar by David Moyes had faded long before Spurs swooped.",
      "Thomas Frank identified the Ghanaian as his priority signing, Kudus picked out Spurs as the only club he wished to join, West Ham swallowed their pride to fund much-needed squad improvements and Arne Slot looked on longingly.",

      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Joao Pedro and Mohammed Kudus have joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Kyle Walker is ‘close’ to completing a ‘shock’ move to a rival Premier League club in a ‘significant coup’.",

      "So the pity is out of the way let’s stick the boot in, a year ago before you came 16th I said that you were just a poor team, it’s still true, you have next to nothing in terms of players that are “Man United” standard, Bruno is the best of a bad bunch and sadly he wouldn’t get into a lot of Prem sides because he’s a bit sh*t.",
      "I really hope that this is the year you get relegated, last year was a close call and Ruben is going to keep his terrible form because he’s not that good, they’ll sack him before Christmas as they should but which idiot will take the poisoned chalice, a lot of managers have taken the United job and none have come out of the other end smelling of roses (maybe the little Norwegian but his other jobs were Molde and Cardiff), you won’t get a good manager and even if you do it won’t matter because you’re poor and will come close to the bottom 3 again (hopefully Leeds spends this mystical £300 million so they can overtake you).",
      "This team is on par with West Ham just 10 times more expensive, it’s not an insult, West Ham are okay, the problem that Man U have is, coming back to the start of this e-mail, your owners have created a toxic atmosphere, every player that has been brought in the last 5 years has been rather good at the club they were at before joining United, Onana looked like he had hands when playing for Ajax, Sancho was in German team of the season, Mason Mount wasn’t constantly injured from embarrassment and Antony was touted as a world beater.",
      "They then joined United and became terrible, this is due to the horrible place that Old Trafford and Carrington has become, it wouldn’t matter if United bought prime Messi and Ronaldo, they would go to United and fall out of love with football and turn poo, you did this to yourself.",
      "Don’t think of relegation as a problem, it is freeing, it is the only way you are going to be sold to someone who may actually like the club more than money, one of your owners has a Chelsea season pass for God’s sake, you should be protesting every match but it doesn’t matter, it won’t get the club sold, just hope for relegation and that someone nice takes over you.",
      "So please stop hoping it’s your year or that you can make a splash in the market (the Mbeumo thing is really funny, even if he came he’d be terrible for you, also Cunha is going to flop), you should hope to get relegated, its the only thing that will save your club otherwise you’ll just be Everton, forever in 17th.\nRich Jennings, Hull (I just looked at United’s full squad on Wiki and it’s p*ss funny)",

They have of course been very close and had a few minor things gone differently they would have won a title, nevertheless there is logic in suggesting the team that finished second just need a few tweaks to finish first. In the same way that there is logic suggesting Liverpool are one of the favourites this year, which you did, rather hypocritically after pointing out that everyone starts on zero points.",
      "There is also logic in people suggesting that the reasons for failing to do better than they have are being addressed could see them become more successful. Yes Liverpool were the best team last season and deserved the title, but Arsenal struggled without a recognised striker and should they get one, then their chances of going one better than second place are increased. That’s all people are saying. Don’t jump on the Liverpool victim train this early me old mate.\nAndrew",

We do all start on zero points in August but the bookies probably won’t have all 20 teams at 25:1. Some of the teams will probably even have kept some of their players from last year. Some of those players will probably be either good or bad like they were last year.",

      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "23) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "22) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "21) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "20) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",

      "19) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",

      "18) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",

      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",

      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United."

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",

      "9) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "8) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders but their business might be almost done now.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £96.76m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "He is now being pursued by Juventus, who seem eager to land the winger, if they can finance a deal.",
      "But talkSPORT broadcaster Alan Brazil feels a return to Dortmund – where Sancho scored 50 goals and chipped in with 64 assists in his spell as a permanent player there from 2017 to 2021 – is the best course of action.",

      "Whether that is the avenue which will land Juventus Sancho remains to be seen, but it seems he’s open to the move.",
      "Reports have suggested that he’s willing to take a pay cut to land in Turin, with a £115,000-per-week (€133,000) contract is being discussed, which would see Sancho’s wage cut by more than half.",
      "It is said he has taken ‘drastic action’ in terms of lowering his demands in order to ensure that move happens.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘agreed’ to sell Jadon Sancho to Juventus, but wage demands and transfer terms are proving tricky.",

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal is a done deal. Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",

      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",

      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",

      "10) Ousmane Diomande (Sporting)\nThe Ivorian has previously been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, but looks set for FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen could trigger a transfer domino effect, with the Premier League champions likely to step up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi. If he leaves, Oliver Glasner has to get his replacement right. Diomande would be a coup and a safe option in that regard.",
      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera (Valencia)\nAvailable for around £17million, Mosquera is only 21 and out of contract next year, prompting Arsenal to make an offer to sign him this summer. Valencia said no, but personal terms are already in place for the Spaniard to move to the Emirates.",
      "The one-cap Spanish international played in 37 of Valencia’s 38 La Liga matches last season. In the one game he missed, Carlos Corberan’s side lost 7-1 to Barcelona. He probably knew what he was doing with that 94th-minute suspension-clinching yellow card the week before.",
      "Mosquera is one of the most promising central defenders in Europe and it’s no surprise to see Arsenal interested. He’d be outstanding right-footed cover for William Saliba.",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joins Real Madrid.",

      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often. For my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t prise Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",

      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",

      "",
      "Oscar Bobb (Manchester City)\nA serious injury robbed Bobb of the chance to establish himself at Man City, and now he’s further down the midfield pecking order than his ability and potential deserve. We can’t think of a Premier League player more in need of a summer loan. He needs to play to realise that incredible potential, which will benefit both City and Norway in the long run.",
      "He’s a special player and needs regular first-team football. There’s a strong chance Pep Guardiola looks abroad. Borussia Dortmund seems an excellent fit, though they’ve just signed Jobe Bellingham, while Bayer Leverkusen could also be an option.",
      "In the Premier League, a mid-table side like Everton, Bournemouth or West Ham would make perfect sense. There’s no doubt Bobb improves those teams, and obviously any of those expected to finish below them. If a newly promoted club like Leeds United manage to get the 21-year-old for the season, they’ll be bloody delighted.",
      "",
      "Tyrique George (Chelsea)\nEvil Saka is a cracking player. Effective on the left, right and even through the middle, the 19-year-old winger could hang around and get insufficient minutes at Stamford Bridge, or get regular minutes elsewhere in the Premier League.",
      "From just 10 starts across all competitions, George has scored three goals and made five assists — a pretty impressive return. He started up front against Manchester United in the Premier League after impressing Enzo Maresca in earlier appearances off the bench.",

      "The 18-year-old would surely benefit from being as far away as possible from the Old Trafford dumpster fire. They can learn from the Alvaro Carreras mistake by properly developing Amass and ensuring he doesn’t slip through their fingers with measly buy-back options. They really screwed the pooch there, with Carreras off to Real Madrid as the perfect left-wing-back in Xabi Alonso’s system. Ruben Amorim will be raging.",
      "",
      "Mikey Moore (Tottenham)\nA very positive and confident player who’s ready for more minutes than he’s going to get in this Spurs team. It’s maybe a case of quantity over quality, but there’s a lot of competition for places in wide areas, which makes a loan move a sensible option.",
      "Moore is only 17 and someone Spurs rate very, very highly. Loaning him out at such a young age isn’t crucial for his development, but if it goes well, the upside is gargantuan.",
      "",
      "Vitor Reis (Manchester City)\nCity aren’t completely sold on loaning out Reis, just six months after signing him for £30million from Palmeiras. But it does make sense, doesn’t it, lads?",

      "He spent last season with Las Palmas in La Liga, playing 27 times, and that experience stands him in good stead to consistently feature in a Premier League team next season.",
      "",
      "Chido Obi (Manchester United)\nIt’s anyone’s guess who takes on young Obi, but he has incredible potential and United might view a season of regular first-team football as the best thing for his development. Whatever they decide is best will ultimately turn out to be the worst.",
      "Similarly to Moore, Obi is at an age where it makes sense to keep him around playing youth football and the occasional first-team minutes. But with no Europa League, there won’t be minutes against clubs from Kazakhstan or a Thursday-Sunday schedule that demands rotation.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\n“My plan for Josh Acheampong is very clear. I want him to stay with us. He’s absolutely part of our project,” said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca of the 19-year-old defender, who can play right-back, left-back and centre-back.",
      "A permanent transfer is off the table, but surely Chelsea would be open to loaning Acheampong to another Premier League club to pick up some vital experience before selling him next summer for £25million.",
      "Crystal Palace have reportedly enquired, which could see Acheampong follow in the footsteps of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher by spending time at Selhurst Park on loan from the Blues.",
      "",
      "Tom Watson (Brighton)\nThere’s more chance of Watson going to the Championship than another Premier League club, unless he returns to Sunderland for the season.",
      "The 19-year-old scored the goal that got the Black Cats promoted, netting in injury time in the Championship play-off final against Sheffield United. His only post-season minutes came in that Wembley showpiece — and he made them count.",
      "",
      "Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)\nWe were reluctant to include players who’ve already spent time on loan in their short careers, but Kroupi is more a new signing than a returning loanee. Signed from Lorient in January, the teenage striker stayed where he was for the remainder of the campaign and helped the club win Ligue 2.",
      "The 19-year-old scored 22 goals in 30 appearances last season to help Lorient win promotion, after scoring five in just over 1,000 minutes in the top flight in 2023/24.",
      "He’s one for the future, and Bournemouth know it, having spent around £10m to sign him in the winter transfer window.",

      "Manchester United are really paying for previous mistakes which has left them unable to copper up for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Send your views on this and all subjects to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Man Utd paying for years of incompetence\nThe chickens are really coming home to roost this summer at United. The problems are too well known and widespread to warrant another yet another email about them but this summer’s transfer struggles are hopefully the natural end point of all of the nonsense of the previous 12 years.",
      "Firstly, United have no cash. Despite a relatively healthy PSR headroom for last FY (which must be healthier now we haven’t bought Mbeumo as expected), by all accounts United are running out of actual money to spend and need to sell to buy. This is a result of what now must be considered generational incompetence in the transfer market and a willingness to hand out extreme wages to players of a questionable age or suitability for Our League.",
      "The result of all this is that we can’t simply go around slapping £5M (add extra 0s where appropriate *cough* Anthony *cough*) extra on the table for any player we are interested in. We also can’t afford to take on big, big wages even where a transfer makes good sense for all involved (Osimhen).",
      "Basically haggling every deal within an inch of its life is the reality for United now. There is clearly frustration that United haven’t agreed or walked away from the Mbeumo deal but it seems to me he’s one of two players the club identified and went for early and were working on a deal that we can afford. There’s no way we’ve been speaking to Brentford for a month and we don’t know what the cost is. No, I think we’ve got our backs to the wall and we’re counting the pennies.",
      "I wonder also if this is holding up sales as well. Sell Garnacho for instance and there’s suddenly not quite as much need to be tight on Mbeumo. Brentford will know that and, to quote Van Der Sar, will challenge us to go as high as we can. That’s the right time to walk away.",
      "And on the subject of sales, that’s a massive clusterf**k. Naive from Amorim and the club to think they could publicly exile these players and expect that teams would still be lining up to sign them. The scarcity of cash and Ratcliffe’s wish to monetise everything at the club should mean that these players are treated like assets.",
      "If you want to get rid then fine but lower the price and move on. If you want to maximise your profit, make them look better than you have. Obviously none of the players have really done themselves any good in a United shirt and their loan spells have been a mixed bag. At the moment, everyone knows they’re overpaid and United are desperate to get rid. Not great conditions for a quick sale.",
      "But of course all these issues stem from past mistakes at the club: the distribution of excessive wages after short term performance (Rashford), terrible planning/negotiating (Anthony) and poor man-management (Sancho – all of them?). As with everything United, it’s systemic.",
      "We’re not going to see a United in the transfer market buying predatorily or selling efficiently until we fix the performance of the squad which we can’t do quickly until we’re better in the market. So it’s going to painful for some time.",
      "Be prepared this summer for no striker, centre mid or goalkeeper. This is just the reality for United now. I can live with it if in five years things have very much improved.",

Ridiculous.",
      "I’ve seen it insinuated so many times lately. I’m not saying they wont be challenging again – I’m sure they will be up there – but every year every team starts afresh. The league starts on zero points. Being 2nd the previous year doesn’t give you some sort of points advantage going into next season.",
      "Arsenal have not won the title the last few years simply because other teams were better than them and they were never as good as they and many others portrayed them to be. Liverpool won it last year because they were the best team from the kick off. And there is nothing to suggest they wont be the best team again next season. But they like everyone else are starting afresh (though obviously for tragic reasons theirs will be a strange and unusual campaign to start with).",

      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",

      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
