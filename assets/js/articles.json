      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will miss the opportunity to scout one of his midfield transfer targets in action next week when they face Wolves in the Premier League. The position is an area of priority for Jason Wilcox next month after investing over £200milllion elsewhere back in the summer.",
      "United are expected to weigh up their options in January when the transfer window opens. The Reds bolstered their squad with a new goalkeeper, striker and two additional forwards in the previous window, but failed to secure a new central midfielder.",
      "A potential deal for Carlos Baleba fell through after Brighton and Hove Albion's asking price was deemed too steep. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also reportedly on United's radar following their standout performances this season.",
      "However, another name has surfaced in recent months - Wolves' Brazilian sensation Joao Gomes. The 24-year-old was previously linked with a move to Old Trafford, prior to United's £50million acquisition of Manuel Ugarte in 2024.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Wolves believe that Gomes' value is higher with the club in the Premier League, rather than as a Championship side if they suffer relegation. Other reports have suggested that the midfielder could command a fee close to £44m.",
      "After their midweek loss to Nottingham Forest, the Wanderers are heading to Old Trafford on Monday in search of their first victory of the season. The match was seen as a chance for Amorim to watch Gomes play live before the transfer window, but that's now off the table.",
      "Gomes received his fifth yellow card on Wednesday night, resulting in a one-match ban. This means Rob Edwards will have to delve into his squad for the journey to Old Trafford, with Marshall Munetsi tipped to step in.",
      "Fellow Brazilian Andre is another Wolves player that both Amorim and United will be keeping tabs on. The midfielder has previously been linked with a move to United and is also rumoured to be on Arsenal and Liverpool's radar.",
      "Whether United will be active in the January transfer window remains to be seen. However, potential exits could significantly impact their plans, with several players garnering attention.",
      "Reports suggest that Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia could all be allowed to depart. None of the quartet have been regular starters this season, and ESPN have reported that the club is open to offers.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui set to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations, United could find themselves short-handed for the second half of the season, leaving Amorim in a tricky spot.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has long held the position that consistency is key when it comes to managerial success. As such, he would likely recommend Liverpool stick with Arne Slot despite a downpour in results at Anfield of late.",
      "A disappointing 1-1 draw at home to Sunderland on Wednesday has left the Merseysiders with only four wins from their last 14 games. And after dazzling English audiences by winning the Premier League title in his debut campaign last term, Slot is now struggling to escape scrutiny.",
      "United legend Ferguson was no stranger to the sensation during his 27 years in charge at Old Trafford. And although he retired in 2013 as arguably the greatest manager in British history, even Ferguson came in for serious questioning at points across that tenure.",
      "The Scot left an all but impossible lead to follow when David Moyes was appointed his immediate United successor. And after his countryman was fired only 11 months into the role, Ferguson called for clubs to show patience with their picks even when pressure is being ramped up.",
      "\"There's no evidence that sacking a manager gives you success,\" said Ferguson in 2015. \"But there is evidence at Manchester United, at Nottingham Forest, at Arsenal that [if] you retain the manager for long periods, you get consistency and you get success.\"",
      "Former rival Arsene Wenger was in charge at Arsenal for almost 22 years and brought the Gunners into the 21st century. The Frenchman won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups in England, but his greatest impact at Arsenal was arguably instilling a culture and style that only comes with time.",
      "Ferguson also referred to Nottingham Forest and Brian Clough's 18-year spell in charge at the City Ground. And it was under Clough's command the club won back-to-back European Cups, attaining huge success in the late 1970s in particular.",
      "Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) proved they made the right pick in appointing Slot as Jurgen Klopp's successor last season. But that instant gratification has been muddied by a torrid couple of months.",
      "That being said, while Manchester United have displayed a habit for fast turnover when it comes to coaching appointments, Liverpool traditionally show a little more faith. Slot is Liverpool's seventh managerial appointment of the 21st century, while the Red Devils have had six since Ferguson departed the club only 12 years ago.",
      "Not only that, but the fact Slot accomplished so much, and was in fact in the running for a quadruple, in his debut season should give him a stay of execution. It's also easy to forget Liverpool initially made a sensational start to the season by winning their first seven games of the campaign.",
      "Bearing that in mind, it may not take many tweaks before the Liverpool of that not-too-distant past is back. And Ferguson's own history serves as proof a little bit of trust can go an awful long way.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been encouraged to push through a deal for Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson after claims he would be a \"special\" addition to the squad. Ruben Amorim is believed to be searching for midfield reinforcements, particularly as Kobbie Mainoo has slipped down the pecking order under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Additionally, Casemiro is in the final 12 months of his Old Trafford deal and is yet to commit his future to the club. United have been strongly linked with a swoop for Forest star Anderson, who has been in impressive form this season.",
      "Manchester City are also reportedly monitoring the 23-year-old midfielder, who under contract at the City Ground until June 2029. Forest are said to be reluctant to part with Anderson during the January window, even if bids approaching £100million arrive.",
      "However, reports suggest potential suitors believe an offer exceeding £80m might be enough to persuade club owner Evangelos Marinakis to reconsider his stance. Former Premier League striker Dean Saunders has now urged United to make their move and pip City to Anderson's signature.",
      "The ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss reckons he could prove instrumental in helping Amorim drive the club forward.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, he said: \"Elliot Anderson understands the position. He understands when he should go forward and who he's playing with. He doesn't give the ball away, which is a common trait among the best players I ever played with.",
      "\"They've all got one thing in common - they don't give the ball away and he's one of them. He's getting better. Forest just needs to get a few more wins and get him up the league so he can play without the pressure being on him.",
      "\"Manchester United picked up another win at the weekend, which is keeping the wolves from the door. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, I think they're better than what they had. They've signed three good players there and adding Anderson to it would be special.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has just got to keep surviving. He's just got to keep getting three points when he needs it and giving himself time to work this jigsaw puzzle out.\"",
      "Multiple clubs are reportedly lining up to secure Anderson's signature, with the midfielder earning widespread acclaim for his commanding performances since arriving at Forest just over 12 months ago. Whilst a move back to former club Newcastle has been dismissed due to financial constraints, Liverpool are also believed to be monitoring his situation closely.",
      "Anderson's impressive form has earned him a place in the England squad, with manager Thomas Tuchel singing his praises. The German tactician has hailed Anderson as an \"important\" player for the Three Lions, despite the midfielder having only accumulated six caps to date.",
      "Speaking last month, Tuchel said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us. He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though.",
      "'He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me. He is an elite player with the right attitude and a lot of talent. He is fulfilling his role in the best way possible so we are very happy with him.\"",

      "Manchester United reignited their resurgence last weekend with a 2-1 comeback victory at Crystal Palace, while West Ham were left frustrated after Lucas Paqueta’s controversial red card contributed to a 2-0 defeat against Liverpool.",
      "United’s win at Selhurst Park ended Crystal Palace’s longest-ever unbeaten home run in the Premier League, as Oliver Glasner’s side had gone 12 consecutive games without defeat on their own turf. Jean-Philippe Mateta’s retaken penalty put Palace ahead, but goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount—both set up by Bruno Fernandes’ free kicks—turned the game in United’s favor.",
      "The victory was a much-needed response for the Red Devils following their disappointing home loss to 10-man Everton. Now sitting seventh in the table, United are just three points behind third-placed Chelsea as gameweek 14 approaches.",
      "Since a rocky start to the season, with four defeats in their first seven matches across all competitions, Ruben Amorim has overseen just one loss in United’s last seven outings. However, the Portuguese manager faces the prospect of an unwanted record: if United lose on Thursday, Amorim will have suffered 10 Premier League defeats at Old Trafford in just 20 matches—reaching that milestone faster than any other manager in the club’s history.",
      "December has not been kind to Manchester United in recent years, as they are currently on a three-game Premier League losing streak in the month, failing to score in any of those matches. Still, the Old Trafford crowd may have more to cheer about than their visitors, whose three-match unbeaten run ended against a resurgent Liverpool side last weekend, thanks in part to Paqueta’s dismissal.",
      "Between goals from Alexander Isak and Cody Gakpo, Paqueta received his marching orders after dissent, then made headlines with a fiery online attack on the FA, criticizing their lack of support during his spot-fixing investigation—a case in which he was ultimately cleared.",
      "Depending on other results this week, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, currently 17th, could find themselves in the relegation zone before Thursday’s kickoff. The West Ham manager will be seeking his first Premier League away win with the club at the fifth attempt. The last time a West Ham boss failed to win any of their first five top-flight away games was Avram Grant in 2010.",

And below is a look at Liverpool’s next five fixtures in the Premier League compared to their rivals as they look to move back into contention for the European places after a very challenging spell.",
      "Liverpool's next five fixtures",
      "Leeds United (A) - Saturday, December 6",
      "Brighton (H) - Saturday, December 13",
      "Tottenham (A) - Saturday, December 20",
      "Wolves (H) - Saturday, December 27",
      "Leeds United (H) - Thursday, December 1",
      "Verdict: Newly-promoted Leeds welcome Slot’s side this weekend, and they will be full of confidence after beating Chelsea on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, Brighton have struggled on their travels this season.",
      "Either side of Christmas, Liverpool take on Tottenham and Wolves, with both teams struggling significantly for results on their own patch and away from home, respectively. Slot will no doubt hope his side can make the most of the way the fixture list has fallen for them and start to climb back up the table.",
      "Chelsea's next five fixtures",
      "Bournemouth (A) - Saturday, December 6",
      "Everton (H) - Saturday, December 13",
      "Newcastle (A) - Saturday, December 20",
      "Aston Villa (H) - Saturday, December 27",
      "Bournemouth (H) - Tuesday, December 30",
      "Verdict: Chelsea will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing defeat to Leeds when they take on Bournemouth on Saturday. The Cherries are currently five games without a win after being beaten by Everton on Tuesday night.",
      "Games against Everton and Newcastle United before Christmas are also expected to be tough tests. While a trip to Villa Park after Christmas will be tricky. With Chelsea dropping further behind Arsenal in the race for the title on, they can ill afford any more slip-ups.",
      "Manchester City's next five fixtures",
      "Sunderland (H) - Saturday, December 6",
      "Crystal Palace (A) - Sunday, December 14",

      "Nottingham Forest (A) - Saturday, December 27",
      "Sunderland (A) - Thursday, January 1",
      "Verdict: Sunderland away is one of the toughest games in the Premier League at the minute. A trip to Selhurst Park will also be tricky. But West Ham at home before Christmas could be more straightforward.",
      "Manchester United's next five fixtures",
      "West Ham United (H) - Thursday, December 4",

      "Newcastle United (H) - Friday, December 26",
      "Verdict: West Ham United at home is exactly the type of game United want at the moment, likewise a trip to Wolves at the weekend. However, games against Villa and Newcastle United over Christmas will be tough.",
      "The next five game weeks could prove to be pivotal for all these clubs - some of whom will still have one eye on getting involved in the title race.",

      "Manchester United are preparing to face West Ham United at Old Trafford, hoping to build on their 2-1 away win over Crystal Palace at the weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side found themselves behind at the break in south London following Jean-Philippe Mateta’s penalty, but responded after the interval. Goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount ensured that United bounced back from last week’s home defeat by Everton.",
      "Manchester United are confident of keeping academy starlet JJ Gabriel following Barcelona’s interest in the teenager. The 15-year-old came to wider attention following a hat-trick for United’s U18 side at the weekend and has scored 10 in as many games so far this term.",
      "Barcelona have previously invited Gabriel and his family to the Camp Nou, with the United prospect also meeting first team players and touring the club’s facilities. However, United are determined to fend off Barcelona’s long-standing interest in the England U16 international.",
      "United boss Amorim, who has already involved Gabriel in training, has spoken about the youngster: “Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media. You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Scott McTominay has made it clear that he has no regrets over his decision to leave Manchester United. The 28-year-old joined Napoli last summer and enjoyed a dream campaign as he helped the club win the Serie A title.",
      "The Sun reported that upon being named Serie A Player of the Year at the Gran Gala del Calcio awards, McTominay said: \"Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place.”",
      "McTominay made 255 appearances for his boyhood club. However, leaving United has given the Scotland international a new lease of life.",
      "He added: \"It's sensational, it's incredible to be here and win this award. Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my teammates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Wes Brown has urged head coach Ruben Amorim to add a left wing-back to his squad in January. Patrick Dorgu joined the club in the last winter window as wing-back cover on both flanks, but Amorim appears less settled on the left than in some other positions.",
      "Dorgu, who joined from Lecce in Amorim's first window in charge, has struggled to replicate his international form at club level. United's boss has urged the Dane to play with less anxiety, and Brown thinks the answer for now could be to add a specialist in the position.",
      "\"I’m probably going to have to go with… and I’m not sure if Luke Shaw can do it… a left wing-back,\" Brown told the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast when asked about the transfer United need to prioritise. \"But I reckon we’ll see Luke Shaw there in the upcoming games.",
      "\"You want to have that [energy] at wing-back. Amad Diallo can do it. He’s going to lose a few at the back-post, I suppose, every now and again, but you can see the difference in age.",
      "\"I just feel with Manchester United at the moment, a lot of our good possession and where we’re strong is on the right-hand side. Our left probably isn’t as strong and it would be nice to see that so United can both ways. Everybody knows Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, when they get on the ball, it’s dangerous. It’s not exactly the same on that left-hand side.\"",
      "England international Shaw struggled with injuries last season but has put together a run of games under Amorim this term. Those outings have mostly come as one of three centre-backs, though, rather than in the physically demanding left-back role.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also a left-sided specialist, but the Dutchman appears to have no Old Trafford future despite failing to seal a summer move away. The former Feyenoord star has been an unused sub three times this season without making it onto the pitch, and is out of contract in June.",
      "United take on West Ham on Thursday, and a win would further boost their hopes of European qualification. Amorim confirmed Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire will miss the game through injury, but Matheus Cunha is ready to return.",
      "\"We have two doubts for the game,\" Amorim added in his Wednesday press conference.. \"I will not tell you today because we will change the way we are going to approach [the game]. Let's see if they can play tomorrow.\"",

      "Manchester United are targeting a player who once left Joshua Kimmich wowed. United spent big in the summer on attacking reinforcements but are set to turn their attentions to defence and midfield in the next two windows.",
      "Ruben Amorim's project at United is still a work in progress, with the side hopeful of showing signs that they are moving in the right direction under the head coach. The 40-year-old has been in charge for just over one year now, taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "His arrival came with an understanding that it would take some time for his 3-4-3 system to work, but patience has worn thin among some of the fanbase at times. A Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and a lack of European football for this season has only ramped up the pressure on Amorim so far.",
      "With that in mind, and the focus on some improvements in the near future, United are looking towards the transfer market for the next possible signings who could help. There will be a keen sense of trying to find value, as well as those who can make something of an immediate impact.",
      "According to BILD, one of the players on the club's radar is Nathaniel Brown, a left-back from Eintracht Frankfurt. The 22-year-old could be viewed as a possible recruit for the left wing-back role that is in place in Amorim's system, which hasn't quite been nailed down by any player yet.",
      "Brown, 22, has been a regular for Frankfurt since he signed for the club last season, having had a knack for scoring and assisting a goal or two. There is an expectation that Brown will leave Eintracht Frankfurt in the near future, with the club said to be welcoming offers and ready to cash in.",
      "However, a fee in the region of £57m could be demanded, while a move in the summer seems more likely than the January transfer window, given the player's World Cup hopes.",
      "Arsenal and Real Madrid are also believed to be in the mix for the defender, who have all been monitoring him in recent months. The German international has received plenty of praise in recent weeks for his performances, including some kind words from Joshua Kimmich.",
      "Despite being on the end of a 3-0 defeat to Bayern Munich, Brown defended well when coming up against Michael Olise, which led to some praise. Kimmich said after the game: \"He did well, especially because he played against Michael [Olise].",
      "\"I know from my own experience how difficult that is, but I already had him [Brown] on my radar beforehand.\" Brown will now have one eye on making the Germany squad for the 2026 World Cup, with an opportunity up for grabs.",
      "It's a position for United that could do with some more consistency, with Amorim needing specific traits from his wing-backs in the system. The head coach has often switched between using Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot on the left, with some uncertainty over the position.",
      "Amorim was particularly frank about the struggles Dorgu has faced so far, as he recently said: \"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games.",
      "\"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision[s] he’s making in our team. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.”",
      "The potential interest in a player like Brown could indicate just how unsure Amorim is of his current wing-back options at his disposal, particularly on the left. It's unclear whether the defender would be open to such a move, but it indicates the type of market that United are operating in.",
      "The club are keen on finding value, adding in the young stars who can add quality with room to grow for the future and perform beyond their transfer fee.",

      "He was United's first-ever black goalscorer and was also included in Sir Alex Ferguson's first-ever team for the defeat at Oxford United in November 1986. However, it was claimed on Wednesday that he had passed away.",
      "Moses and his wife are claimed to be living in Zakynthos, a Greek island in the Ionian Sea. The 65-year-old former midfielder also coached at Doxa Pigadakion for a short spell a couple of years ago.",
      "And in a statement on Wednesday, the Greek outfit claimed it was his wife who informed them of Moses' death. But journalist Andy Mitten has revealed that Moses is alive and well.",
      "Taking to social media platform X, he wrote: \"Understand social media rumours of Remi Moses dying are not true. He's alive and well. But had he looked on social media, he'd have seen how many people absolutely loved him as a player.\"",
      "Replying to Mitten's post, Reece Blakeley, one of Moses' children, confirmed: \"I have just spoken with my brothers (his sons). Can confirm the legend is still alive and well.\" While a United spokesperson said: \"Remi's family have confirmed to us that the rumours of his passing are entirely false. They are baffled about their origins, and report him to be healthy and in good spirits.\"",
      "Moses made 199 appearances for United, and earlier today, a statement from Doxa Pigadakion even went as far as revealing when his funeral would take place. The statement read: \"Our club had the honour, for a short time, to collaborate in sports with Manchester United footballer, Remi Moses, when in the 2020/2021 season, he was the coach of our women's team.",
      "\"To the fanatical football fans, and not only to the fans of the Bebedos of English football, he will always remain in our minds, as that football player in the mid-80s, who wrote endless kilometers in the midfield of Manchester United.",
      "\"His great football moment was the qualification in 1984, against Barcelona, when he personally limited Maradona to these two matches.",
      "\"Remi, for several years now, has been a permanent resident of Zakynthos. With our club, and with its people, he has always had communication and a two-way sporting respect.",
      "\"These feelings led his wife to contact us immediately yesterday Tuesday morning, to inform us that Remi is no longer with us, and to ask for some small help.",

There is confidence that the 2010-born starlet will stay at United for the long haul, rebuffing interest from Barcelona.",
      "Last week, United's head coach Ruben Amorim was said to have held a separate meeting with Gabriel and his camp. It came after the teenage sensation was pictured in first-team training with the rest of the United squad.",

There was a chance for Rashford to join Aston Villa this summer - after an impressive loan stint in the second half of the 2024/25 season - but Villa chose not to exercise their £40m option.",
      "Rashford will have the chance to add to his goals and assist tally for Barcelona when they take on Real Betis in La Liga this weekend. It will be the first time Rashford goes up against his former United teammate Antony since both players opted to leave the Red Devils on loan in January.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford gave Barcelona a much-needed lift from the bench in their 3-1 triumph over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. The victory at Camp Nou extended the La Liga leaders' advantage over Real Madrid to four points.",
      "Rashford started the match on the sidelines due to the recent return of Raphinha on the left wing, but he was brought into the fray in the 67th minute with Barca leading 2-1 and Diego Simeone's side seeking an equaliser.",
      "His introduction, along with Ferran Torres, added some spark to Hansi Flick's attack, and it was the Spanish substitute who scored the third and final goal of the match in the 96th minute.",
      "Despite this being the fourth consecutive match in all competitions where the England star hasn't scored or assisted, his contribution on Tuesday was positively received, as noted by sections of the Spanish media.",
      "Sport lauded his immediate impact and the problems he posed for the Atletico defence during his 24-minute stint on the pitch. They described his performance as \"stinging\" and summarised: \"He came on and quickly began causing problems for Atlético from the left wing. He came close to scoring and provided a much-needed boost for Barca in the final minutes.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo echoed these sentiments, praising his counter-attacking abilities thanks to his impressive speed, which nearly saw him add to his tally of two league goals this season.",
      "The publication stated: \"He breaks free on the counter-attack after a pass from Casado and shoots after a cutback, but Oblak deflects it with his foot. Great play by the Englishman.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Despite Rashford's impressive showings for Barcelona, questions have arisen over whether his spell in Spain will extend beyond his season-long loan. When he joined Barca this past summer, the club secured an option to make the Englishman's move permanent for £26million.",
      "He's become a consistent performer with six goals and nine assists in his opening 19 appearances across all competitions. However, according to Spanish publication Sport, concerns persist within the club about the 28-year-old's substantial wages, despite his contributions.",
      "Rashford accepted a 25% wage reduction to join the Catalan giants, with his weekly earnings now standing at £240k, which Barca are paying in full. The England international's tactical adjustment is also reportedly causing unease, with Rashford said to be contributing little in terms of high pressing, a fundamental characteristic of any Hansi Flick side.",
      "The report further suggests that the club's future transfer strategy will focus on finding backup for Raphinha, with United hoping a verdict on Rashford's uncertain future arrives soon.",
      "If the Manchester-born winger returns to Old Trafford next summer, he may be loaned out for a third successive season or sold, as Ruben Amorim doesn't view him as part of his long-term vision for the club.",

      "Manchester United's 2025 Christmas party has reportedly been given the go-ahead after Sir Jim Ratcliffe cancelled last year's. The United hierarchy stopped any festive cheer 12 months ago following a round of cuts.",
      "Last year, the party was cancelled after it was deemed inappropriate to celebrate following a first round of redundancies that resulted in 250 jobs being axed. The scrapped celebration saved the club more than £100,000, with the annual staff bonus of £100 being replaced with a £40 voucher from M&S.",
      "Now, the Daily Mail have reported that staff members will get the opportunity to celebrate Christmas this year, with chief executive Omar Berrada deciding to invite all staff members to the event. It will be held in one of the larger suites at Old Trafford, with food and musical entertainment provided for employees.",
      "The decision comes after United's hierarchy ran the changes following Ineos' minority takeover. A further 200 redundancies, which reduced the workforce from 1,150 to 700, saved the club millions.",
      "\"If we hadn't have implemented the cost programmes and restructuring that we have done over the last 12 months. So we have to deal with all those things, and there's only so many things you can deal with at once.",
      "\"We have a new management team, we have to deal with the financial restructure, then we have to move on to the squad, data analysis, and moving forward.",
      "\"But we are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. But I am not actually surprised where we are in the league because Ruben's only got a certain size of squad he can deal with, and quite a number of those players are injured or not available to him.\"",
      "He added: \"The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things [widespread cuts and restructuring].",
      "\"Ultimately, if you look at running the club the size of Manchester United with an income of about £650m you spend a part of that £650m on operating the club and part of it on the squad.",
      "\"Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club, or do you want to spend it on the squad? Because if you spend it on the squad you get better results.",
      "\"And at the end of the day what's Manchester United here for if it's not to win trophies and silverware. What we want to do is invest in the best players in the world if we can, rather than spend it on, I'm afraid, free lunches.\"",

      "First, Obi hasn't played a single minute of senior action for United during the 2025/26 season after Amorim decided to leave him in the Under-21s for this campaign. He has since shone, netting five times in 13 matches.",
      "The 18-year-old, who made eight first-team appearances for the Red Devils last term, is continually improving and there are whispers the next step is to loan him out in the January transfer window.",
      "Indeed, The Sun reports that United are open to loaning Obi out next month to help further his development by gaining more first-team minutes in the EFL or National League.",
      "Heaven, 19, is another player United are aiming to loan out. The youngster made a name for himself when he was thrust into the limelight by Amorim last season, particularly impressing against his former club Arsenal.",
      "However, like Obi, Heaven has found regular first-team game-time hard to come by this term. He has clocked up just 28 minutes in the Premier League, coming on as a second-half substitute against Fulham and Brighton.",
      "And with Lisandro Martinez's return from injury, Heaven has been demoted to being third-choice left centre back, behind the Argentine World Cup winner and England international Luke Shaw.",
      "Heaven's spot on the bench could also be in jeopardy when Harry Maguire returns to fitness in the coming weeks. Heaven recently had a stint with the U21s against Solihull Moors in the National League Cup.",
      "Leon, another United youngster, is being tipped for a loan move. The prodigy, born in 2007, joined the Reds from Cerro Porteno over the summer, but has yet to make his first-team debut.",
      "Despite being included in their senior matchday squad four times, Leon's playing time has been with the U21s this season. He netted his first goal for Travis Binnion's side in a 4-1 victory over Tottenham in October.",
      "Goalkeeper Radek Vitek has thrived since his loan move to Championship team Bristol City in the summer, while full-back Harry Amass has impressed with Sheffield Wednesday. Both Vitek and Amass appear ready to step up to United's first-team squad next summer.",
      "While the Reds could recall Amass due to their issues at left wing back, the club believes it's best for him to continue his development on loan at Wednesday.",
      "Ethan Wheatley, a 19-year-old forward for England U20s, has scored three goals and provided two assists in 17 games for League One outfit Northampton Town. Meanwhile, midfielders Ethan Ennis and Dan Gore have seen plenty of action at Fleetwood Town and Rotherham United, respectively.",

      "Former Manchester United star Paul Parker has earned over £100,000 by selling a number of treasured pieces of memorabilia from his career. Parker, 61, played for the Red Devils between 1991 and 1996, making 146 appearances.",
      "In that time, he won the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup having played under legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson. But Parker has been willing to part with a number of items from across his playing career.",
      "As per The Sun, the former defender decided to auction off a miniature silver Premier League trophy which was given to winners during the 1992/93 season instead of medals. The trophy reportedly fetched £27,280 when up for auction.",
      "Other highlights included Parker’s medals from United’s 1993/94 Premier League triumph, as well as their FA Cup win vs Chelsea the same year. Each of the medals went for £16,120.",
      "Parker’s League Cup winners medal fetched £5,700, while a further Charity Shield plaque was sold for £1,736. Away from items from his club career, Parker also decided to bid farewell to a host of mementos from his international career.",
      "The former right-back sold off each of the 19 England caps that he had earned. Each of those fetched £3,720, except for the cap that Parker won when he played for the Three Lions’ in their defeat to West Germany in the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy - that cap instead earning £8,060.",
      "A spokesman for auctioneers Budds said: “The main reason for selling is that he is quite friendly with Viv Anderson and some of the other players who have sold their collections.",
      "“With the market so strong for Manchester United mementos at the moment he wants to maximise their value and give the proceeds to his family.”",
      "Speaking about his career with Man United earlier this year, Parker said: “Everything I wanted as a kid was to play for the biggest club I could. I always said, aim as high as you can. If you fail, you can always go down, but start at the top if you can.",
      "“ The FA Cup final was the dream. That was what I wanted when I was a kid, playing in the garden. Back then, the FA Cup was the glamour game. It was the last match of the season, the one everyone talked about.",
      "“It was only when I got into professional football that I realised the real prize is the league, the marathon. That’s what you’re judged on. You don’t have to be a great team to win the FA Cup, but you have to be a great team to win a league title.",
      "“The sides I played in under Sir Alex, and the ones after me, were great champions because of the football they played: expansive, fearless, always attacking. We were never told to sit back. We played positively!”",

Tuesday night saw Rashford and his team-mates earn a 3-1 victory over Atletico Madrid at the Camp Nou to move further clear at the top of the Spanish top-flight standings.",
      "Despite being named on the bench, Rashford was brought into the contest by Barcelona boss Hansi Flick in the 67th minute, replacing Robert Lewandowski with the scoreline at 2-1. Former Manchester City star Ferran Torres then netted a third for Barca to seal the victory.",
      "Even though Rashford didn't make the starting XI, the 68-cap England international was thrilled to contribute to Barcelona's victory, securing three more points in their La Liga campaign.",
      "\"Important win and great team performance,\" Rashford posted on Instagram.",
      "This latest appearance marks Rashford's 19th game this season across all competitions, including 14 in La Liga. His contribution has helped the Catalan giants extend their lead at the top of the table to four points, ahead of their fiercest rivals Real Madrid.",
      "Rashford's post comes just before the January transfer window opens, while speculation about the future of the United loanee is set to intensify as the New Year approaches.",
      "United agreed to Rashford's departure during the summer transfer window, following the player's expressed wish to leave Old Trafford ahead of the new Premier League season.",
      "Rashford may have only temporarily left United this summer, but Barcelona have the option to make his transfer permanent at the end of the season for a fee of €30million (£26million).",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson once brutally called out Jordan Henderson in public over his running style. The legendary Manchester United manager had been keeping tabs on the promising talent during his time at Sunderland and thought about making a move for him.",
      "But after sending scouts to watch Henderson in action, Ferguson decided against pursuing the midfielder due to his unusual gait, claiming Henderson \"runs from his knees\".",
      "Ferguson wrote in his autobiography: \"We looked at Jordan Henderson a lot and Steve Bruce was unfailingly enthusiastic about him. Against that we noticed that Henderson runs from his knees, with a straight back, while the modern footballer runs from his hips.\"",
      "He added: \"We thought his gait might cause him problems later in his career.\"",
      "United's oversight proved to be Liverpool's gain as, in 2011, a 20-year-old Henderson moved to Anfield for approximately £20million. He featured in 37 Premier League matches during his debut campaign under Sir Kenny Dalglish and nearly clinched the title in 2013/14 under Brendan Rodgers.",
      "Henderson, currently at Brentford, later reacted to Ferguson's remarks by saying: \"What was written in the book never bothered me.",
      "\"To be honest, I looked upon it as a compliment that I got a mention. The fact Alex Ferguson was watching me at some stage must have meant I was doing something right.",
      "\"I was never aware of any interest from United and I'm happy with how things worked out. I'm enjoying my football and we're progressing well as a team. I never felt as if I had a point to prove really except maybe to myself and to Liverpool Football Club in terms of improving as a player.\"",
      "But Rodgers was left furious with the Scotsman's comments. He said: \"I think if Sir Alex ever bumps into Jordan he might want to apologise for that.",
      "\"The comment surprised me, I have to be honest, coming from someone with such status in the game. Maybe it was meant as flippant but to a young player making his way in the game it could be damaging.",
      "\"Every player is different, and every player at this club has had his strengths and weaknesses medically assessed. The statement in terms of Jordan was inappropriate.\"",
      "Henderson responded in the best possible way - with his performances on the pitch. He was named captain of Liverpool in the summer of 2015, ahead of Jurgen Klopp’s arrival a few months later.",
      "He became instrumental in Klopp's Merseyside revolution as the team grew increasingly competitive, reaching the Champions League final in 2017/18 and claiming the trophy twelve months later.",
      "Henderson also played 30 league matches during 2019/20 as Liverpool cruised to their first Premier League title, which they lifted when the season resumed during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "The England midfielder clocked up a total of 492 appearances for the Reds, scoring 33 goals and providing 58 assists, figures that barely scratch the surface of his monumental influence both on and off the pitch.",
      "In a shock move, he decided to leave Liverpool in 2023 for Steven Gerrard's Al-Ettifaq project in Saudi Arabia, believing his opportunities at Anfield under Klopp would be limited ahead of the new season.",
      "Henderson's two former clubs, Liverpool and Sunderland, are set to face off in the Premier League on Wednesday night at Anfield. His boyhood team Sunderland have kicked off the season exceptionally and currently sit sixth in the table in their first season back in the top flight.",

      "A year ago today, Manchester United lost to Arsenal, conceding two goals from corner kicks. Later in the month, they would concede set-piece goals to Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth at Old Trafford, as well as seeing Tottenham and Wolves score direct from corners against them.",
      "The heat was on Ruben Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes back then. United were a soft touch at set pieces and offered virtually no threat at the other end of the pitch, and that woeful combination led to calls for Fernandes to be stripped of set-piece planning responsibilities.",
      "Now, every time United get a corner or a free-kick, Fernandes still rises to his feet to oversee the plans, but gone are the jitters that come defensively and the expectation that nothing will come of it in the opposition's penalty area. United's comeback success at Selhurst Park last weekend was thanks to two set-piece goals and only Arsenal have scored more of them this season.",
      "But United are creating a higher xG from set-pieces and are scoring goals from them at a better rate than the Gunners, who only top the scoring charts because they have more attacking corners and free-kicks than Amorim's side. Amorim has admitted to stealing set-piece ideas from other clubs, but gave credit for the upturn in fortunes to the work Fernandes is doing on the training ground and the research he is putting in on the opposition.",
      "He is backed up by 27-year-old first-team analyst Kaita Hasegawa, who is devoted to set-pieces. Hasegawa has also recruited a team of data experts tasked with focusing on them. Once Hasegawa and his team have passed the information on to Fernandes, the 31-year-old devises routines and gets down to business at Carrington on running the players through them. The work is paying dividends.",
      "\"In this league, set pieces can win you games,\" said Amorim. \"Or you can lose if you don't pay attention to that. I'm really pleased with the job that they are doing.\"",
      "United's approach to set-pieces seemed shambolic when Amorim first arrived, but, as with so much of the Portuguese head coach's first year, a lack of time on the training ground played a part in that.",
      "Now, United have a week to prepare for most games, having failed to qualify for Europe and been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August. That free time is helping to improve their sharpness at set-pieces.",
      "\"Last year we trained without the real movement we can put in the position,\" said Amorim. \"If you don't have space and you cannot put load because they are recovering, it's not the same thing.",
      "\"[Now] you have more time to kick corners and free-kicks and you can create real game situations this year. That helps. If you train more time you will improve. That is normal.\"",
      "Amorim believes United can still improve defensively when it comes to set-pieces and admitted that area of the game is now so crucial in the Premier League that it is impacting his team selection.",
      "\"You have to think about who you put in the squad, if you play with Amad, Bryan, Bruno, all these guys,\" he said. \"If you don't have Casemiro - and we suffer against Tottenham with that - not Sesko, not Harry.",
      "\"So you have to make a balance sometimes, thinking 'yes, the idea for the game is this one, but if you have set pieces against it cannot be this team'. Our league is like that at the moment.",
      "\"You need to think not just the way you are going to play but also in set pieces. If you look at it with a little bit of attention to the league you understand that set pieces are massive for the game. Sometimes, to open the game. If you score a goal you are in better conditions to win the game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez that they must fight it out for the right to get in his team as the Argentine's return from injury sets up a fascinating duel between the pair. Shaw has started every Premier League game this season and made his 300th appearance for Manchester United in Sunday's win against Crystal Palace.",
      "But he was withdrawn towards the end at Selhurst Park and replaced by Martinez. The 27-year-old was making his first appearance in 10 months after recovering from a serious knee injury. Martinez has had misfortune with injuries in the last couple of years, but now that he is fit, he is desperate to make up for lost time and will be eyeing a challenge to Shaw to get in the team as Amorim's left-sided central defender.",
      "There is a chance Shaw could yet be used as a left wing-back, although he has barely played that position since Amorim's arrival and the demands would be a test of his newfound durability. For now, the 30-year-old is likely to keep his place against West Ham on Thursday, but Amorim has set up a battle between the two left-footers for a place in his team going forward.",
      "\"They have to fight,\" he said. \"We talked about that as a group last year. We needed to win the Europa League. You have 11 players because you have no idea what is playing one game per week. You are going to be upset because you are not going to play. It’s 11 players that can play and then the rest you have to fight. That is the situation. That is not a problem. That is a blessing. That is my job to choose.",
      "\"Licha is a guy who has a big character. I feel that he stops for a year and now he wants things really, really fast and you have to manage that to explain with that injury, we need to go step by step, but he's getting ready, he's feeling really strong. He's one more guy to help the team to play better, so I'm really happy with Licha at the moment.\"",
      "Shaw's renaissance has been remarkable after his own injury woes restricted him to just five starts last season. He had made only 27 appearances across the last two seasons before his run in the side this term.",
      "\"We took special consideration in the beginning,\" said Amorim. \"When we are building the player, we have to be careful. Trying to control the load, not putting so many minutes. Even the position is completely different.",
      "\"You know that the demands of that different position he is going to struggle. He adapts really well to that position because sometimes he's playing with the ball like a fullback. But he's defending more deeply. He's really smart.",
      "\"For me, I said already I think he's a world-class player. Of course, he needs more continuity. Like he's showing this season. We are playing just one game per week. That helps a lot. If he needs three days to recover, and he's not needing it now, but if he needs it we can give him.",
      "\"We are not taking special measures for him in this moment but we had to do it in the beginning when he was starting to have more minutes.\"",
      "Amorim left the door open to Shaw playing as a wing-back in his system, with the absence of Noussair Mazraoui and Amad during the Africa Cup of Nations set to lead to a shortage of options in that position from mid-December.",
      "\"It's different, you have to train there,\" said Amorim. \"Before you think to put a different player in that position, you need to train there. Or he needs to do some minutes and then he needs to come off. Or return to a different position.",
      "\"But he's ready to if we need him. Maybe we are going to need him and in this system he can play there.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha is set to return to the Manchester United squad against West Ham on Thursday but Ruben Amorim has two fresh doubts that could force him to draw up a new game plan. Cunha is back in contention after missing the last two games following a training ground incident on the eve of United's game with Everton, but Amorim refused to confirm who the players at risk of missing the game were.",
      "\"We have two doubts for the game, it will change the way we’re going to approach it, let’s see if they can play,\" the United head coach said. The rest of the squad is good. Mathues is ack. Harry and Sesko are still out.\"",
      "Maguire has been out for three weeks with a thigh injury and Sesko hasn't played since the draw at Tottenham after picking up a knee injury not long after coming off the bench in North London. Cunha has just one goal in 11 games for United since his move from Wolves in the summer and Amorim believes the Brazilian has more room for improvement as he prepares to return to the team.",
      "\"I think he has more levels to go,\" he said. \"He is in a different club, different pressure but I think he copes with that really well.",
      "\"He was struggling because he was not scoring and he was thinking too much about the numbers. But the influence that he has in the team is so important for us but I think Cunha has so much to grow defensively and offensively.\"",
      "West Ham will be without Lucas Paqueta after his red card against Liverpool but Amorim is confident his countryman Nuno Espirito Santo will be successful after taking over at the London Stadium earlier this season.",
      "\"I had no doubts he will have success,\" he said. \"He’s really experienced, he knows how to work with different squads, understands really well the league.

      "There is less than a month to go until the start of the January transfer window and Manchester United could once again look to strengthen their squad. Both incomings and outgoings have been brought up in the conversation for the Reds, who spent more than £200million in the summer but might decide to add to their ranks next month.",
      "Should United want to bring players through the door, sales may be needed. Kobbie Mainoo is one star who has been heavily linked with a move away from the club, with Napoli said to hold an interest in the midfielder.",
      "Meanwhile, Joshua Zirkzee, despite scoring his first Premier League goal since December 2024 in the win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, is another with Roma among those interested in him.",
      "Looking at players United have been linked with, a new midfielder is thought to be at the top of Ruben Amorim's priorities with Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton tipped to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "While work will be going on around the transfer window, Amorim will have eyes on midweek Premier League action. United host West Ham United tonight as they look to record back-to-back wins.",
      "Stay here for all of the latest transfer news and rumours throughout the day...",
      "Man United and Chelsea are reportedly tracking teenage midfielder Mohamed Zongo.",
      "According to Caught Offside, Chelsea are well-placed in the race, despite United, Villarreal and Anderlecht having made the early running.",
      "Zongo impressed at the recent Under-17 World Cup, scoring twice as Burkina Faso reached the quarter-finals.",
      "Man United have been urged to seal a deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson after being told he would be a \"special\" signing.",
      "Ruben Amorim is understood to be in the market for a midfielder as Kobbie Mainoo has fallen out of favour with the Portuguese boss.",
      "United have been heavily linked with a move for the Nottingham Forest star following his impressive form this season. Manchester City are also reported to be interested in the 23-year-old midfielder, whose contract at the City Ground expires in June 2029.",

      "El Mala is the latest player to be linked with a move to Man United.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the FC Koln winger.",
      "Reports in Spain suggest Man United are admirers of FC Koln winger Said El Mala, with Liverpool and Chelsea also interested.",
      "European football expert Andy Brassell, believes United are 'the most sensible option' for the winger.",
      "\"You don't really look at Manchester United and say there is a great place for a young player to develop,\" he said. \"But if you're looking at where he would fit logically, United is the most sensible one out of those, I think.",
      "\"Liverpool are obviously in a state of flux at the moment, and you wonder how much football he would actually play there. [Man] City have wide players absolutely to die for at the moment.",
      "\"So you wonder how much he would play there. United is maybe the obvious one. You look at their successes of late, United, and really, you look at someone like Amad [Diallo], and he is someone who feels quite old school United.",
      "\"A player who is not scared of stepping up despite the pressure, despite the situation, despite this sort of heaviness that seems to be around United all the time. He still wants to get on the ball and make stuff happen. You could definitely imagine El Mala doing that as well, from the other side.\"",
      "Reports in Spain suggest Man United are ready to bid over €150m (£131m) this summer to lure either Vinicius Juior or Fede Valverde from Real Madrid.",
      "Valverde is viewed by the Reds as an 'absolute priority' in their rebuild, while Vinícius has yet to sign a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu - a situation United are monitoring closely.",
      "Football Insider claim that Man United have chosen to 'accelerate' their pursuit for Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Losing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad later this month has triggered concern for the club. Former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown said: \"Losing players to AFCON is a major concern for Amorim.",
      "“Both Mbeumo and Amad are going, and Mazraoui behind them, so its the entire right-hand side going away for at least a month. It could have a real big impact on their season if they’re not prepared, and the manager feels the squad is light in those areas, so something will have to be done.",
      "\"Semenyo is the one they’ve been looking at, because Ghana didn’t qualify for AFCON. It looks like he will be available in January because of that release clause in his contract, that’s why there are a few clubs having a look at him.",
      "\"But United need to spend in January to improve the squad, and he’s somebody they wanted to bring in during the summer before he signed that contract. If the opportunity comes up when the window opens, it would make a lot of sense because he would also be able to plug that hole left by Mbeumo.\"",
      "Brandon Williams' post-Manchester United career could have taken a further blow after Hull City manager Sergej Jakirovic admitted he could leave the club permanently in the January transfer window.",
      "Williams racked up 51 appearances for the United senior team having come through the academy at Carrington. However, his career took a drastic turn two years ago when he was involved in a high speed crash.",
      "In May 2025, the defender was handed a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, a three-year driving ban, and a significant amount of community service at Chester Crown Court. \"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now. I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm becoming one of the senior players in the squad as well, so it's important for me to help the young players as well because I know how difficult it is. It was difficult because everyone kind of forgot what I actually achieved; people don't understand that.",
      "\"I didn't even understand at the time what I've actually achieved (playing for Manchester United at such a young age). There are a lot of people in the world who would wish that for their child or something like that. It was upsetting that I've let a lot of people down; it's for me to get things right now.",
      "\"Like, I've always said as well, I don't want any sympathy from anyone. It was my actions; I took responsibility for them. I've apologised, and all I can do now is just focus on my football and get things right on the pitch, and I'm sure that people will appreciate that.\"",
      "Teenage sensation JJ Gabriel has reportedly attracted the interest of Barcelona.",
      "The Spanish giants are said to be working hard to lure Gabriel away from United and bring him into their renowned La Masia academy.",
      "\"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" Ruben Amorim said. \"You could see the U21s had a game and we had less players and tried to pick players for training that have talent.",
      "“Not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace. If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "He has scored ten goals in ten games for the Under-18s this season.",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United's interest in Antoine Semenyo is 'growing', with the Reds starting to believe that paying a premium is going to be worthwhile for the Bournemouth winger.",
      "United view him as a versatile, proven-quality addition for the future, especially if they return to European competition. However, the Reds are preparing for a January bid as they are concerned that waiting until the summer could result in them failing to sign him.",
      "Man United have received a huge boost in their pursuit for Conor Gallagher, it has been claimed.",
      "In his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano reported there was a chance Gallagher could depart the Estadio Metropolitano this January.",
      "\"I think there is a chance for Conor Gallagher to leave Atletico Madrid already in the January transfer window or eventually in the summer,\" Romano said. \"This will also depend on the formula of the deal. Manchester United were interested in Conor Gallagher as an opportunity in the final days of August but Atletico said no to a loan move and they don’t have that kind of intention.",
      "\"I think if maybe a permanent transfer proposal arrives, that would be different. Maybe something around 30 million euros (£26m), sources say that this could be the way to get Conor Gallagher in the January transfer window.\"",
      "Manchester United are prepared to compete with Arsenal for the potential transfer of Eintracht Frankfurt's Nathaniel Brown.",
      "According to BILD, there is a significant risk of Frankfurt losing Brown this summer, and the Premier League could be his next destination.",
      "It's suggested that Frankfurt are in a position where they will have to sell the two-time Germany international.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes claim Man United have submitted a £53million bid to sign Newcastle United star Harvey Barnes in January. The winger has scored four goals in his last six Premier League appearances.",
      "However, it's said that Chelsea have also made a 'similar' proposal for the 27-year-old. With that said, Newcastle have no plans to part ways with Barnes at present, viewing him as difficult to replace.",
      "Man United are monitoring Atalanta youngster Sergej Levak, according to Calcio Mercato.",
      "The 19-year-old has been likened to Rodri, with a knack for arriving in the box at just the right moment, and is expected to make his first-team debut in the near future.",
      "It's said that United have had a scout tracking his recent games, though a 'number of big clubs' are also watching him.",
      "According to LaRoma24, Roma's management has received approval for the needed budget to secure a high-level striker, and Joshua Zirkzee is mentioned as one the Italian club want.",
      "It's said that Roma's ownership will guarantee financial coverage for the deal, whether it is a loan or a permanent transfer. Zirkzee, however, could still stay at United in January.",
      "Antoine Semenyo REJECTED an offer from Manchester United in the summer, it has been reported. The Reds wanted to sign the Bournemouth winger but he turned down the chance to move to Old Trafford.",
      "He instead remain at the Vitality Stadium, though United still remain interest and are tempted to re-ignite a potential move for Semenyo during the January transfer window.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta is said to be of interest to Manchester United again, according to journalist Alan Nixon, with the Crystal Palace forward refusing to sign a new contract at Selhurst Park.",
      "United were previously quoted a price of £40million when they enquired about a transfer for the 28-year-old, who has 18 months left to run on his contract at the Eagles.",
      "It's said there is a good chance United sign Mateta with Palace eyeing up Manchester City's Divin Mubama, who is on loan at Stoke City, as a replacement for the France international.",
      "According to a latest report from Tuttomercato in Italy, Napoli's 'most likely option' is to sign Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United. Antonio Conte's side want to negotiate a loan with an option to buy the England international, who has struggled for game time at Old Trafford this season.",
      "Mainoo has indicated he is available, though the situation is expected to be become clearer in two weeks ahead of the January transfer window opening.",
      "According to The Athletic, Manchester United 'agreed personal terms' with Carlos Baleba in the summer, though the Reds did eventually opt against making a bid for the Brighton midfielder.",
      "As was the case then, this is not a deal that will come cheap for the 13-time Premier League champions, should United attempt to come back in for him during the January transfer window.",
      "Indeed, Brighton wanted at least £100million for the Cameroon international, who is also attracting interest from Tottenham, and the Seagulls are expected to demand the same amount now.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Leny Yoro to stop beating himself up over mistakes, and revealed he had pulled the young centre-back aside after he showed his frustration in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on Sunday. Yoro conceded the penalty which allowed Jean-Philippe Mateta to open the scoring at Selhurst Park, before goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount saw United side roar back in the second half.",
      "Amorim took Yoro off during the celebrations for the equaliser, with Noussair Mazraoui already stripped and ready to come on. The 20-year-old showed his frustration as he was withdrawn and needed an arm around the shoulder from Mason Mount at full-time. That gesture was praised by Amorim, who revealed he had spoken to Yoro about his reaction to mistakes and also used this week to show him clips of positive elements from his performance at Selhurst Park to try and rebuild his confidence.",
      "\"I also spoke with him because he thinks too much, he makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he’s too young and he wants to do everything so well,\" the United head coach said. \"He’s growing, with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy. He cannot give that to the people the way he came to the bench, he understands that but he was really frustrated.",
      "\"On the good side, it shows that he cares, he knows it wasn’t his best game but he did some things well and I showed him that also. He’s fit and ready for the next challenge.\"",
      "Amorim also insisted there was room for improvement in the performances of Diogo Dalot, while praising his ability to play as a wing-back on either flank. \"He can do a lot of things better, like other players,\" he said. \"When you see a very good game of Diogo he can show he has the quality, but sometimes he drops a little bit.",
      "\"He’s really powerful, he’s good on set-pieces, he can play both sides. To have that ability of playing both sides that can help you to think about the squad. He’s a very important player for us but he needs to improve like another player.\"",

The 18-year-old has had his first taste of being part of a matchday squad in recent weeks and the forward is highly-rated within the United academy.",
      "Although he didn't get on for his senior debut and could find his place in the 20-man squad taken with Matheus Cunha's return to action, Amorim insists Lacey is ready for a chance and will get one soon. United have no European games this season and are already out of the Carabao Cup, reducing the number of opportunities for young players to feature.",

      "Williams would spend time on loan at Ipswich Town in the 2023/24 campaign but after just 17 appearances for the Tractor Boys, the Reds decided to release the defender. After being a free agent for the entirety of the 2024/25 season, Hull decided to take a punt on Williams and offered him a one-year deal.",
      "Following the transfer being completed, Williams insisted he was ready to atone for the errors he made previously. He said: \"It was just a learning process. Things did happen, but like I said, I've learned from them now. I'm growing up now, I'm not a young player no more.",

      "Sadly for Williams, his chance to put things right on the field has not been forthcoming. The 25-year-old has struggled with his fitness and has made just one appearance in the Championship which was a five-minute cameo in the second game against Blackburn Rovers.",
      "Jakirovic confirmed on Wednesday that Williams is now back in the treatment room again and his time at Hull could be coming to an end. He told BBC Humbserside Sport: \"He felt yesterday his calf a little bit sore, he will go on an MRI and so we are awaiting news.",
      "\"Also we made one plan for him, six weeks plan, so he has the rhythm of the game so he played for the U21s and together with the club now we will decide what we will do with him in January - he will stay with us, he will fight for his place or he will continue forward maybe to change the club. But, we will see, this is also a question for all of the club.",
      "\"Right now, in those games (for the U21s), he showed something but I don’t know if this is enough for Championship. This is something that I need to decide for the January window - he will stay or he will change.\"",
      "When asked if this would be more likely to be permanent rather than a loan, the Hull manager said: \"Yes, yes, yes we are speaking now because January, if we can swap some positions we will do that but if we cannot then we will continue like this.\"",
      "\"He’s understanding. I cannot say now that he looks much better than when he arrived here but for the Championship you need an even better level,\" Jakrovic concluded.",

      "Manchester United are counting down to the next summer transfer window where they will, inevitably, add yet another midfielder to their ranks. Casemiro has held down the fort this season and to varying degrees of success, but his contract expires at the end of the campaign.",
      "Should that happen, United would, of course, need to sign a defensive midfielder to plug their gap in the centre. Currently, there are no players in the squad who you could see being the first choice once Casemiro exits. Manuel Ugarte would be the obvious solution, on paper.",
      "However, the Uruguay midfielder has underwhelmed when he has played for United and his performances in the main have been more misses than hits. Beyond the ex-PSG man, the Reds struggle for options. That's why the auditions have been opened for stars to impress Jason Wilcox and Co. ahead of potentially moving to Old Trafford next season.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba was first up to the plate, but his display was tough to watch. He made a rod for his own back with a 'joke' message to supporters ahead of the game, which was quickly deleted. When the whistle blew, very few were left laughing.",
      "Baleba struggled to stop Bryan Mbeumo all game and, when he was eventually hauled off, the shake of his head said it all. Last Sunday, it was the turn of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton to impress.",
      "United know Wharton can perform better than he did at Selhurst Park and mitigating circumstances were at play for his display against the Reds - chiefly among which was him featuring in Strasbourg on Thursday evening. While he would not be a direct replacement for Casemiro, the Englishman is still seen as an option to rebuild the midfield and if he was aiming to put his best foot forward, it did not work out.",
      "He would have been eager to make a good impression, but a booking against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night was his fifth of the season. This means Gomes will be suspended when United arrive in town and, thus, a big opportunity is missed for the 24-year-old.",
      "Nobody has taken their chance to show the United recruitment team why they should be the club's No.1 option in the summer transfer window. Gomes' moment was right there, but it has gone completely now.",
      "Matheus Cunha has said Gomes reminded him of Casemiro and undergoing a suspension is something the United midfielder knows all-too well. It's by no means a deal-breaker him being unable to play the Reds on Monday night, but it's very easy to put yourself in the shop window when you face United.",
      "But with that chance gone, Gomes must set his sights on the return fixture at the end of this month.",
      "Such a short period before the next meeting vs United is the only saving grace for the Wolves midfielder.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's exit from Manchester United in the summer transfer window was inevitable. There was concern about his second season at Old Trafford even before Benjamin Sesko was brought in to provide competition at centre-forward for Ruben Amorim's men.",
      "The Dane scored a mere four goals in 32 Premier League appearances and while his overall statistics were boosted by six goals in the Europa League, he was still down on where he was for United in his debut campaign. When Sesko eventually arrived, it was clear the Slovenian was being groomed to be the first choice and Hojlund would have to settle for being a back-up.",
      "In a World Cup year, this was never going to be something which Hojlund entertained. He knew he needed to be playing regularly and while AC Milan were willing to offer him those minutes, the striker wanted to choose a more permanent solution.",
      "Hence why his move to Napoli was agreed. While Hojlund only joined Antonio Conte's side on a loan deal, the options to make it permanent are very likely to be reached, so agreeing to a temporary switch was never going to be a major problem for the striker.",
      "The transfer made sense for all involved, particularly as Hojlund was already proven in Serie A and had only gained valuable experience of the Premier League during his time at United. He started well too having scored four goals by the start of October - not spectacular but a steady start to life in Naples.",
      "However, since his last goal on October 5 vs Genoa, Hojlund has not scored for his domestic team. He was injured for two Serie A matches which halted his momentum but the Dane now finds himself struggling to find the back of the net.",
      "From a United perspective, this answers any lingering concerns they had about agreeing Hojlund's exit.",
      "When Sesko pulled up injured against Tottenham Hotspur to pause what has been a slow start in front of goal for the striker, many wondered if it had been the right call to allow Hojlund to leave.",
      "The Reds have been left without a striker to lead the line in the Slovenian's absence. While Joshua Zirkzee scored against Crystal Palace on Sunday in only his second start of the campaign, United still felt lacking in the forward areas.",
      "Having Hojlund still at the club to make up the numbers was not the solution, though. The Dane is still a raw talent who could become good in the future, undoubtedly.",
      "But for the here and now, he is not the player which United need. Hojlund is someone who deserves to have a more experienced striker alongside him who can ease the pressure off him or be the main man for a team floating around the Europa League or Conference League level.",
      "Since Erling Haaland's incredible start to his career, there has been a push to find another centre-forward who can fit the exact same profile. The truth is, he is the exception rather than the rule and if Hojlund was back in the United set-up now, he would not be the fit which Amorim needs.",
      "Does this mean United don't need to add a striker to their squad? No, of course not. They are crying out for more options in the No.9 role but the answer comes from a more experienced head and not from a player like Sesko who is still learning his trade at the highest level.",

      "Manchester United have been urged to seal a deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson after being told he would be a \"special\" signing.",
      "Ruben Amorim is understood to be in the market for a midfielder as Kobbie Mainoo has fallen out of favour with the Portuguese boss. Meanwhile, Casemiro is into the final year of his contract at Old Trafford and has yet to agree an extension.",
      "United have been heavily linked with a move for the Nottingham Forest star following his impressive form this season. Manchester City are also reported to be interested in the 23-year-old midfielder, whose contract at the City Ground expires in June 2029.",
      "It has claimed that Forest are unwilling to sell Anderson in the January transfer window, even if they receive offers of around £100million. However, reports have suggested suitors believe a fee or more than £80m could be sufficient to tempt club owner Evangelos Marinakis to change his mind.",
      "Former Premier League striker Dean Saunders has now called for United to take the plunge and beat City to Anderson's signature. The ex-Wolves and Wrexham manager believes he could play a pivotal role in helping Amorim to take the club forward.",
      "Speaking to BoyleSports, he said: \"Elliot Anderson understands the position. He understands when he should go forward and who he's playing with. He doesn't give the ball away, which is a common trait among the best players I ever played with.",
      "\"They've all got one thing in common - they don't give the ball away and he's one of them. He's getting better. Forest just needs to get a few more wins and get him up the league so he can play without the pressure being on him.",
      "\"Manchester United picked up another win at the weekend, which is keeping the wolves from the door. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, I think they're better than what they had. They've signed three good players there and adding Anderson to it would be special.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has just got to keep surviving. He's just got to keep getting three points when he needs it and giving himself time to work this jigsaw puzzle out.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Clubs are understood to be queuing up to sign Anderson, who is highly regarded for his formidable displays since joining Forest just over a year ago. While a return to his old team Newcastle has been ruled out for financial reasons, Liverpool are also said to be keen on him.",
      "Anderson's form has even seen him break into the England team, with boss Thomas Tuchel a big admirer. The German described Anderson as an \"important\" figure for the national side, despite only having earned six caps so far.",
      "Speaking last month, Tuchel said: \"Anderson is a key player for us at the moment. He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League - that's why he is with us and starting for us. He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though.",
      "'He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me. He is an elite player with the right attitude and a lot of talent. He is fulfilling his role in the best way possible so we are very happy with him.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has confirmed he is back in Manchester United training after missing their last two games with a head injury. Ruben Amorim stated last week that he expects to have the Brazil international back to face West Ham United this Thursday and with Cunha back on the grass, he looks set to be available.",
      "Amorim had confirmed as such in a recent press conference when asked about a potential return date for Cunha. He said: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without the summer signing, United suffered a very bad defeat to ten-man Everton but the response was emphatic this past weekend as they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were both on target which could see Cunha on the bench for his return match.",
      "Nonetheless, Amorim will almost certainly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad and its fair to say the man himself is also very pleased. Via Instagram stories, with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he said: \"Back back back.\"",
      "That fitness boost looked set to arrive alongside a major blow as Bruno Fernandes was captured on camera limping in the latter stages of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemingly confirmed he would be fine to feature going forward.",
      "“It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.”",
      "And Amorim will certainly need his captain over the coming weeks as United face a busier schedule than usual with their first midweek clash since the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following the visit of West Ham, United travel to Wolves next Monday evening before hosting Bournemouth under the lights again seven days later. Their last clash before Christmas comes against Aston Villa with a Boxing Day clash at Newcastle United following that.",
      "A first start in over nine months for Lisandro Martinez will likely arrive during that period after his brief returning cameo against the Seagulls last Sunday.",
      "As for Benjamin Sesko, he is still missing because of a knee injury picked up against Tottenham Hotspur while Harry Maguire is yet to return from a muscular problem suffered in that same game.",
      "Amorim delivered updates on both in his press conference last week which suggested that returns are on the way, but neither are quite ready just yet.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",
      "Despite the tone of his comments, the Slovenia international has not suffered a setback and is still expected to return for the clash against Wolves later this month.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has \"so much more to accomplish\" in his career after making his 150th appearance in the Premier League against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Amorim questioned his options at left wing-back ahead of the trip to Selhurst Park, admitting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu weren't performing on matchdays as well as they were during training.",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team to face Palace and delivered an improved performance. The Portugal international was the United player with the most duels won and was responsible for winning the foul that led to the second goal, a display which earned praise from Amorim.",
      "When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick. I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",
      "The game saw Dalot make his 150th appearance in the Premier League, which he said is a source of \"pride for playing at the highest level for so many years”.",
      "Dalot added: “I’m very happy to reach this beautiful milestone in the biggest league in the world. My journey has been one of constant growth as both a man and a player, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved knowing that I’m only 26 and still have so much more to accomplish in my career. I’m enjoying every moment.”",
      "Dalot started in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but he struggled against Nottingham Forest, and Dorgu was recalled to face Spurs before the international break.",
      "The 26-year-old is more comfortable on the right, but has played predominantly at left wing-back this season.",
      "When asked after Liverpool if the victory was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",

      "Following the International Football Association Board's (IFAB) intervention, a 'double-touch penalty' must be retaken rather than disallowed, if the ball goes in from the original kick.",
      "As a result, Mateta put his team ahead in the 36th minute, before Ruben Amorim’s side responded with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Yoro was taken off six minutes before the hour mark and was comforted at full-time by Mason Mount.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the game, Yoro reflected on the difficult game he had at Selhurst Park. \"Challenging days - Mindset locked in - Work on.\"",
      "\"Proverbs 24:16: For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.\"",
      "Luke Shaw replied with two love heart emojis while Bruno Fernandes responded with a gif of Yoro celebrating.",
      "Meanwhile, Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Lisandro Martinez, Kobbie Mainoo, Senne Lammens and Mason Mount all liked the post - showing their support.",
      "\"This is a first in the Premier League because the law was amended because of [Julian] Alvarez in the Champions League,\" he explained. \"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick.",
      "\"I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd has outlined why Manchester United may feel aggrieved at Mateta being handed a second chance following his error. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it. That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",

      "A five-game unbeaten run helped lift the early-season pressure on the Portuguese head coach, and United are now just three points outside the top four with a home clash with struggling West Ham to come. Amorim reflected on his first year in the job ahead of the win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.",

      "Terry Gibson says Conor Gallagher's return to the Premier League hinges on whether he's content with his role at Atletico Madrid, and whether he wants to compete in the English top-flight again.",
      "The England midfielder, 25, has excelled under Diego Simeone since making the switch from Chelsea last summer, totting up six goals and six assists in 69 appearances thus far. And as a result of finding his footing with the La Liga giants, Manchester United have recently been linked with making a move for the midfielder.",
      "The Reds have struggled in their engine room for a couple of seasons, with Casemiro's ageing legs leaving him unable to cover the ground he once did during his Real Madrid heyday - while Bruno Fernandes' suitability to a deeper role has been cast into speculation by pundits, evidently more compatible in the No.10.",
      "And with Manuel Ugarte failing to gel under Ruben Amorim, as well as Kobbie Mainoo seeing his future at Old Trafford cast into speculation, United have been linked with a wealth of talent in the January window, including Gallagher. Reports suggest that the Premier League titans are eyeing up a loan deal for the 25-year-old.",
      "\"Because it appears every game, Atletico have a fantastic squad, arguably the biggest, strongest squad in La Liga, and he's suffered because of that. And when he plays, he never lets them down.",
      "\"Koke has been playing ahead of him. Koke has his attributes; he's played 700 games, at the weekend, for Atletico Madrid. And Simeone just can't let go of him. So it's a security blanket for Simeone.",
      "\"Koke has been a wonderful player, but Conor Gallagher does offer a little bit more, now. He gets around the pitch a lot quicker than Koke does and he has a goal-scoring threat. He's been happy to play in a wider midfield position.",
      "\"Would he play in this game? (vs Barcelona on Tuesday). He started in the game against Inter Milan. Probably not then. That means that there will be rotations and changes. But I think that he's really pushing hard for a place on a more regular basis.",
      "\"He's been fabulous. A bit overlooked because we've got Marcus Rashford and we've got Jude Bellingham. He's been overlooked when it comes to the English contingent that are playing in La Liga. But he's been really good.",
      "\"I guess it all depends on Conor Gallagher. Whether he's content with that role in Atleti's team, which a lot of big players have to be at Atletico Madrid. And would he want to make a return back to the Premier League? But he's been good.",
      "\"It's actually good to talk about him because, as I say, he does get overlooked when it comes to the other two big hitters. Tyrhys Dolan gets overlooked. He's probably been arguably the best English player in La Liga this season.\"",
      "It comes as Gallagher will hope to make his mark when Atletico Madrid travel to Camp Nou to take on Hansi Flick's Barcelona on Tuesday, December 2. There, he will meet with fellow Englishman - and United loanee - Rashford, who has impressed during his time on Spanish soil this season.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Barcelona sporting director Deco insisted this week that the Catalan giants are “happy” with Rashford but that now isn’t the time to commit to the buy clause.",
      "Deco told Cadena SER: “Now is not the time to make any decisions regarding Rashford’s future.",

      "Rashford has failed to score or assist in his last three appearances since the November international break and now reports in Spain claim that he is ‘closer to leaving than staying’.",
      "The Man Utd loanee has dropped down the pecking order recently as Barcelona’s injury list has got shorter and ‘things will have to change drastically for them to exercise the €30 million purchase option they have agreed’ with the Red Devils.",

      "Man Utd believe that if Vinicius Junior – who could also cost around €150m – ‘doesn’t sign a contract extension, there’s a window of opportunity to try and sign him’ and reckon ‘a stratospheric offer could open up unexpected negotiations with Los Blancos.’",

      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche.",
      "Daniel Farke and Scott Parker stand out as the ever-present managers among the five apparent relegation contenders at this time, while Thomas Frank really might only have one home game – against his former club – to try and save himself from the Full Nuno Experience at Tottenham.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham?

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But , well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs went to Newcastle – and got a barely deserved draw – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ and a rare home win over Chelsea does anything more than delay the inevitable.",
      "Amorim has confirmed that two players on top of Sesko and Maguire are injury doubts ahead of Man Utd vs West Ham.",

      "It was also clear that their next priority was to sign a new No.6 as they tried and failed to sign Carlos Baleba, who was valued at £100m by Brighton.",
      "Baleba’s valuation made a summer deal incredibly difficult as Ruben Amorim‘s side worked with a limited budget, but they are expected to return to the market for a centre-midfielder next year. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton have also been mentioned as targets.",
      "Despite this, former Man Utd defender Wes Brown thinks they are covered in midfield until the summer as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are performing well, while he “would love to see Kobbie Mainoo more”.",

      "When asked if there is now a more positive attitude to the squad after the duo left, Saha told Pundit Arena: “Totally (the squad is much more harmonious). It’s the best transfer you can make. When you have one player that is not pulling their weight, you can just about manage.",
      "“You can leave them out of the side and the rest of the squad can cope. But when you have three or four players who are really talented, but just aren’t at the races, then it drags the team down a level.”",
      "“It’s really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it’s very important to act decisively in situations like that, so Amorim got rid of them (the disruptive players).",
      "“He replaced them with Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before. These three work hard, they’re willing to defend, they don’t think they’re bigger than the team. With a negative attitude, a team is in big trouble.",

You can afford a few flair players who might not always have that attitude, but it has to be a small minority. Back when I was there, we had Gary and Phil Neville, John O’Shea, Wes Brown. They made life easier for us.”"

      "The Red Devils pulled off a major coup to sign 20-year-old Yoro ahead of Real Madrid in 2024, and his overall form over the past 18 months as one of United’s stronger performers has proven that he was worth the hype.",

      "A potential midfield signing wasn’t entirely overlooked in the summer, with Man Utd making enquiries for Gallagher and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, but some fans and former players feel it wasn’t made enough of a priority.",
      "Man Utd have improved a bit this term but there are rumours that Ruben Amorim is demanding a new midfielder in January as he looks to push his seventh-placed Red Devils up the table.",
      "One midfielder they have been heavily linked to is Real Madrid’s Valverde with reports in Spain claiming that he is one of seven names wanting Alonso out at Real Madrid.",
      "The report claims: ‘The dressing room is divided into two factions. Two opposing views. The majority group is the most critical. The sector that no longer trusts Xabi. The one that feels his methods clash with the club’s identity. And here are the seven names leading this stance: Jude Bellingham, Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Valverde, Brahim Diaz, Ferland Mendy, and Eduardo Camavinga. Endrick joins them, also expressing his discomfort.’",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "The same publication also claims that Valverde and England international Bellingham have both been the subject of ‘offers exceeding €100m (£88m)’.",
      "It is understood that Bellingham ‘can’t find the space or the freedom that made him shine in his first year, while the Uruguayan feels out of rhythm, disconnected, and lacking the physical presence that usually makes him a game-changer.’",

      "“If he wants to be at the World Cup he should take the chance. I think he’s plenty good enough. It must be so frustrating for him knowing his ability and how well he has done, even when he has only had a few minutes, that the endgame is still the same.",
      "“At that age, you just want to play football, you just want to express yourself. He burst onto the scene and for a while he was always the first name on the team sheet. Now all of a sudden no matter what he does, he’s not on the team sheet. So where do you go from there? For me, he has to look elsewhere. He needs to get football. He needs to get minutes.",
      "“As far as I can tell, he hasn’t done anything wrong. If you look at Man United over the last year, you could arguably say that when he has played, he’s been one of Man United’s best players. So the treatment that he’s getting, I honestly can’t understand it.",
      "“Hence the reason why I’m saying that no matter what he does, he’s not going to start unless something happens and unless Casemiro’s form drops again, or someone gets injured, I think he just will not get a start on merit. Which is the sad thing, because he would be in there otherwise.”",

      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "This provided Man Utd the funds to spend around £230m on overhauling their attack and signing a new No.1 goalkeeper, with Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo their marquee additions.",
      "These signings have made a positive impact, but upgrades are still required in centre-midfield and wing-back, especially, while they could also do with landing extra quality at centre-back and up front to provide adequate depth.",
      "Champions League qualification would boost their coffers to execute this business, but Man Utd may also have to wheel and deal to raise funds as they did in the summer.",
      "One such way the Red Devils could free up cash is via adjusting player contracts, with Casemiro and Maguire among those facing uncertain futures at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro is one of six Premier League players enjoying an unexpected renaissance, as his great form has ensured that Kobbie Mainoo’s continued absence has become a lesser topic, while Maguire has remained an important squad player for Man Utd.",
      "With Casemiro, he currently earns around £375,000 a week, and this can be extended on the same terms until 2027. Maguire, meanwhile, earns roughly £180,000 a week, and a completely fresh deal is required if he’s to remain at the club beyond the summer.",
      "And The Daily Mail have shed light on the situation regarding these two players, claiming ‘neither player has a concrete offer on the table at the moment, although United still have time to stop them from leaving as free agents in the summer’.",
      "The report adds:",

      "This is the perfect approach from Man Utd’s hierarchy.",
      "It is easy to justify keeping Casemiro and Maguire beyond this season, given the roles they have played this season, but this comes with the caveat that each player must accept a pay cut to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "That would be the ideal outcome for Man Utd, but letting one or both leave would be a necessary evil if contracts for these players are in the way of the club signing a Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and/or Elliot Anderson next summer.",

      "Man Utd ‘are also interested in Joao Gomes and Angelo Stiller’ – described by the report as two cheaper options – but they ‘know it will take a club-record fee to sign an elite option’.",
      "A £100m deal for Anderson would eclipse the £89m paid to Juventus to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford in August 2016, which was a world record at the time.",
      "United are ramping up their interest in Anderson after learning Manchester City have also decided to chase him.",
      "It was recently claimed the England international is leaning towards City, but this has yet to be confirmed by other outlets.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side received a boost on Tuesday as Forest landed on Lyon’s Tyler Morton as a possible replacement for Anderson.",
      "United made an approach for Baleba during the last transfer window, but we understand they have since cooled their interest due to his drop off in form.",
      "United see Anderson as the dream solution to their midfield issues, and our transfer insider Fraser Fletcher reported on November 18 that they could follow up on his capture with two more signings in the position.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid are also on United’s radar.",
      "DIVE DEEPER 🌟 Key factor in Elliot Anderson hunt revealed as Man Utd face Liverpool, Man City threat – sources",
      "The first victim of Anderson’s potential arrival looks set to be Ugarte. talkSPORT’s Alex Crook has stated that Ugarte’s future at United is ‘looking increasingly bleak’.",
      "The Red Devils are ‘planning a major overhaul’ of their midfield ranks, and Ugarte will be a ‘casualty’ as he will be allowed to move on.",
      "The 24-year-old is not alone, as it emerged on Tuesday night that Kobbie Mainoo could also be offloaded to make room for Anderson.",
      "Surprisingly, Mainoo has been named as an option for Arsenal.",
      "The Daily Mail add that ‘the clock is ticking’ over the future of Casemiro, as he will soon enter the final six months of his contract.",
      "As things stand, United appear unlikely to offer him an extension. The Brazilian could head to Saudi Arabia to earn one last big contract before retiring.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has also discussed the future of Andre Onana, who is currently on loan at Trabzonspor.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the reliable journalist said ‘Onana’s chapter at United is closed’. The goalkeeper will return to United in June but will quickly ‘try to find a new solution’ as he is not in Amorim’s plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim has decided to keep Joshua Zirkzee, despite his tough spell at Old Trafford so far.",
      "Sources state that Zirkzee’s upturn in form has seen him earn a place at United for the full campaign.",
      "Nevertheless, United could still add another centre-forward to their ranks in January, and they are battling Arsenal for a €50m (£44m) Bundesliga hitman."

      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas Jumpers, a definitive table ranking each Premier League team’s Christmas jumper offering to find the best, the worst, and the tackiest Christmas jumpers money can buy.",
      "We have ranked the jumpers on originality, ugliness, Christmas-feel and more festively vague factors that will almost definitely ruin Christmas for many fans who disagree with our line-up.",
      "Introducing the Premier League of Christmas jumpers 2025:",
      "",
      "1) West Ham’s Christmas collection",
      "The design team at West Ham have been having a lot of fun with their Christmas jumpers and we absolutely approve.",
      "‘Santa is a Hammer’, ‘I’m forever blowing baubles’ and ‘All I Want For Christmas Is WHU’ are inspired choices and the club has even rolled out Jarren Bowen to model the collection.",
      "Tacky, pun-tastic and perfectly blending club-specific chants with a Christmas theme. The Hammers have nailed it.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool’s Candy Cane",
      "Liverpool’s standard Christmas jumper is about as disappointing as an Ibrahim Konate contract saga. It’s a bit red and white with some generic Christmas fare such as snowflakes.",
      "Luckily something is going right at Anfield at the moment because whoever designed the Candy-kit inspired Christmas jumper has knocked it out of the park. It is one of the greatest kits of all time and the white patterns lend themselves perfectly to a Christmas feel.",
      "The kit is completed by the slightly unnecessary word ‘Christmas’ as sponsor and a retro badge. Simple but effective.",
      "",
      "3) Bournemouth’s retro away kit",
      "This is how to do a Christmas jumper. Choose a famous retro away kit, in this case the stunning 1992/94 away shirt, replace anything slightly triangular with Christmas trees and get ready for the orders to flood in.",
      "Bournemouth’s retro jumper is bright, Christmassy and distinctly unflattering. It is a triumph at every level.",
      "",
      "4) Newcastle’s striped monstrosity",
      "Newcastle’s confused striped Christmas jumper gets plenty of points because it is truly ugly, like all Christmas jumpers should be.",
      "The dazzling array of stripes, Christmas tree shapes and snowflakes is certainly dazzling but it does lose points for not even trying to fit in the Newcastle Brown Ale star as some sort of Christmas tree topper.",
      "",
      "5) Everton’s Spirit of the Blues",
      "Everton’s 1998-inspired Christmas jumper and the One2One kit is a nice idea but is slightly ruined by the memory of one of the worst ever Premier League teams to somehow avoid relegation.",
      "Instead, the Spirit of the Blues Christmas jumper is our pick because the song that inspired it is the most Christmassy of all the football chants heard across the Premier League. The ‘woo’ part may baffle opposition fans but it just feels festive. Good work, Everton.",
      "",
      "6) Chillin at Cold Trafford",
      "Despite risking an angry phone call from Cole Palmer’s lawyers, Manchester United have released a fantastically hideous jumper featuring a snowman and the phrase ‘Chillin at Cold Trafford’.",
      "The patchwork style jumper is so bad it’s good and we’re picking this one over the admittedly quite nice red and white jumper featuring the famous statue of George Best, Dennis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal’s Highbury Wonderland",
      "The Arsenal Highbury kit worn during the 2005/6 season is demonstrably one of the greatest Premier League home shirts, helped by the fact it was worn by some of the league’s best ever players.",
      "The Highbury Wonderland jumper based on the kit is quite nice. In fact, it’s too nice. Apart from the reindeer leaping over the Arsenal badge there is no hint of garish Christmas symbolism being crowbarred into a football theme. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "8) Spurs’ retro Christmas jumper",
      "Spurs have the enviable position of playing in all white, making any sort of Christmas design pretty easy. The retro Christmas jumper has plenty of nice touches. The Christmas pudding sponsor, the subtle snowflake pattern and the retro Spurs badge reminding us of happier times at White Hart Lane.",
      "Unfortunately the jumper loses points because it’s trying too hard to look like a football kit. We want snowmen and holly patterns, not nicely striped collars.",
      "",
      "9) Leeds’ Christmas jumper",
      "The Leeds Christmas jumper is quite nice. It has the Yorkshire rose, the club’s foundation date, some reindeer and a few snowflakes in a patchwork pattern.",
      "It is a very run of the mill Christmas jumper slightly ruined by the giant modern Leeds badge on the back. There is nothing particularly offensive by it and it’s a solid mid-table effort.",
      "",
      "10) Chelsea’s Christmas jumper",
      "Chelsea’s Christmas jumper is your bog standard effort. It’s blue and white, with Christmas trees, snowflakes and the Chelsea lion all blended into a neat patchwork design.",
      "It’s just fine. Nothing too exciting, very little design flair, but ticks all the Christmas boxes. Like a Mourinho defence of old this one is playing it safe and grinding out the points in the Christmas jumper table.",
      "",
      "11) Villa Park Christmas jumper",
      "Villa Park is one of the best grounds in the Premier League and it should be celebrated as an old school football stadium with a fantastic atmosphere.",
      "It should not, however, be celebrated on a Christmas jumper. The design is fine in that it features a bit of snow and some snowflakes, but the giant badge and stadium design feels a bit too serious.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves’ Christmas jumper",
      "Wolves offer exactly the same Christmas jumper as Burnley’s sorry effort but there is another option. Like Spurs, Wolves have gone down the classic kit route and the 1982-inspired jumper does have a nice stocking built into the alternative Goodyear logo.",
      "It is a bit bland, featuring no other highlights outside of a subtle snowflake pattern, but the Old Gold does at least feel a bit Christmassy.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester City’s Elf",
      "Manchester City have not really got into the Christmas spirit. There’s a pretty generic City badge design covered in snowflakes and one that features an elf design that is completed with your head when it’s worn.",
      "It’s a tired Christmas jumper trope but this one is saved by the fact the club will done £5 from every sale to support patients and their families at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.",
      "",
      "14) Forest’s Christmas jumper",
      "For a club whose badge is literally a tree crowned by two stars there is a distinct lack of Christmas feel in the fairly tame Forest Christmas jumper.",
      "Turning the badge into the Christmas tree is a missed chance that is so glaring Sean Dyche is probably treating the designers to their very own Gaffer’s Day as a punishment.",
      "The jumper is fine, but lacks any sort of flair. At least Dyche will agree with that bit.",
      "",
      "15) Crystal Palace Christmas jumper",
      "Crystal Palace have had some of the best kits in the Premier League in recent years so we had high hopes for the Christmas jumper of 2025.",
      "Unfortunately it’s a bit of a mess. The blue and red combine to make it seem sort of brown somehow and the design is unimaginative. Christmas jumpers are supposed to look a bit hideous but this one just looks a bit depressing.",
      "A big swing and a miss with the ‘South London and Proud’ slogan instead of something more Christmassy too.",
      "",
      "16) Sunderland Christmas jumper",
      "Sunderland’s jumper is red and white, features the word Sunderland and some half-hearted Christmas patterns.",
      "",
      "17) Burnley’s Christmas jumper",
      "Is there some sort of connection with garden gnomes and Christmas we do not know about? The Burnley Christmas jumper is pretty standard fare until you drill into the details.",
      "It features rows of sort of Christmas-themed images including baubles and snowflakes. Then you get to the aforementioned gnomes. At least they’re holding Christmas presents.",
      "A very confused Christmas jumper from a club that has a jumper aficionado as manager. Disappointing.",
      "",
      "18) Fulham’s Christmas jumper",
      "The same as the Burnley monstrosity, this is just a templated Christmas jumper featuring the baubles, the gnomes and the layered pattern.",
      "Fulham slip into the relegation places because there is too much black compared to Burnley’s slightly more festive effort.",
      "",
      "19) Brentford’s Christmas jumper",
      "The Brentford Christmas jumper is ugly enough to pass as a Christmas jumper but apart from two reindeer either side of the huge Brentford badge, it’s not screaming actual Christmas.",
      "The club has made the choice of using bee patterns instead of snowflakes and while that is unique, it feels more like a spring or summer jumper. And since they don’t exist it means relegation for Brentford.",
      "",
      "20) Brighton’s Christmas jumper",
      "Brighton have used a Millwall-style dark blue for their Christmas jumper and then stuck BHAFC on and done little else with the design.",
      "It is a jumper designed to be trendy and modern, but that is not the point of a Christmas jumper. It should make you look ridiculous at your office party.",
      "As a punishment for taking the task too seriously and ignoring the club’s actual colours, Brighton finish rock bottom of the Christmas jumper table."

      "Man Utd‘s academy product enjoyed a remarkable breakout season during the 2023/24 campaign for club and country, but he has struggled to replicate those performances since, as he has been impacted by Amorim’s appointment, injuries and a loss of form.",
      "In this summer’s transfer window, Mainoo requested a loan move to increase his game time as he attracted interest from Serie A giants Napoli, but Man Utd decided to block his exit.",
      "At the time, Man Utd felt that the centre-midfielder’s exit would leave them short of options in the middle of the park, but his situation has not changed in recent months and he remains linked with an exit.",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s player of the season so far includes four sold by Newcastle",
      "Therefore, it has been suggested that Man Utd may be more open to letting Mainoo leave in January, and Football Insider are reporting that the Premier League giants are ‘preparing a U-turn’ on his future.",
      "It is claimed that United’s ‘stance on Mainoo could yet leave after the opening weeks of the January window’ as they ‘may sanction his exit if a replacement is secured’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 20-year-old still looks unlikely to have his wish granted, with sources revealing to Football Insider that the Old Trafford outfit remain undeterred in their desire to keep hold of the starlet. They are set to lose the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to AFCON in the coming weeks, and as such, Amorim is desperate to ensure that he doesn’t leave himself short of options.",
      "‘However, it is understood that the stance on Mainoo’s future could be loosened somewhat if a replacement can be sourced in the early weeks of the winter window.’",
      "ESPN, meanwhile, are reporting that Man Utd are quite likely to let Mainoo and three other players leave to fund a January signing.",
      "The report claims: ‘The club will listen to offers for Mainoo, Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia, but allowing any to leave before the end of AFCON on Jan. 18 would leave Amorim desperately short of players.",
      "‘However, if the United hierarchy can unlock some funds, it could make a move for one of its key midfield targets — Anderson, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Angelo Stiller — in January.’",
      "Arsenal could make a January transfer window move to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to one respected journalist.",
      "Man Utd could now land a midfielder they regret being the alternative rather than the top target in the summer of 2024.",
      "Is this a “big, big few weeks” for the Manchester United star? The last two games suggests it will be more of the same.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",

      "FC Barcelona are uncertain about signing loanee Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United at the end of the season, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan from the Red Devils in July and has made 18 appearances for his new club.",
      "The 27-year-old has registered six goals and nine assists this season, helping him return to the England squad as he stakes a claim for a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s 2026 World Cup squad.",
      "After falling out of favour under Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, Rashford shone on loan at Aston Villa during the second half of last season, but upon returning to Old Trafford, he was informed by the Portuguese head coach that he still wasn’t in his plans.",
      "Barcelona were happy to take Rashford on loan for the season and negotiated a buy option believed to be worth around €30million (£26.3m).",
      "That would be viewed as a bargain if not for the England winger’s mammoth £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Rashford’s wage is one of the reasons Barcelona are reluctant to sign him permanently, and Catalan journalist Alfredo Martinez says no decision has been made by the La Liga champions.",
      "“There are voices for and against (his staying),” Martinez explained (quotes via Sport Witness).",
      "“Some don’t want him to stay because Rashford isn’t the type of player who presses high up the pitch, and besides, he has a very high salary. Barcelona is looking, among others, for a left winger, a player to provide cover for Raphinha.”",
      "The Rashford news cycle is…interesting. When he’s fit and flying, there isn’t much noise, but a few poor games in a row and the knives come out.",
      "Spanish media were quick to realise the weight his name carries, reporting back in September that Barcelona wanted to ‘send Rashford home’ after being unconvinced by his performances.",
      "Rashford didn’t help himself with a disciplinary issue before a La Liga game against Getafe later that month, but it wasn’t blown out of proportion and he was swiftly reinstated by Barca boss Hansi Flick.",
      "There were plenty of reports about Rashford’s future in both England and Spain at the time, coinciding with some damning criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.",
      "While there have been some questionable reports about Rashford’s conduct and relationship with Flick, the Englishman has kept his head down and is enjoying his football in Catalonia.",
      "Since the start of October, he has registered four goals and five assists. But Martinez won’t let good stats get in the way of a good story.",
      "Rashford wonder goal 📽️#UCL pic.twitter.com/pZlOg6E2bb",
      "— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) September 19, 2025",
      "That being said, it’s not impossible that Barcelona genuinely aren’t convinced. But what’s even more likely is that Barca are playing a game to get Rashford for less than the €30m buy option.",
      "Despite Rashford’s good form in Spain, it’s obvious that his Manchester United chapter is over as long as Amorim is in charge, and United’s hierarchy have been very patient with him so far, hinting that there will only be one winner in that battle.",
      "It’s reported in Spain that Barca are scouring the market for alternatives, yet a recent report from the Daily Mirror claimed club president Joan Laporta was delighted with the terms of the buy option, believing it’s a ‘genuine bargain’.",
      "In truth, nobody knows. Not even Laporta knows if it’s a done deal yet. However, what is certain is that Rashford’s name will always be used and exploited for clicks.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford may not get his permanent move to Barcelona in the summer but PSG have ‘tested’ the Man Utd waters with an intriguing swap offer amid interest from Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford reportedly had a ‘serious row’ with Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick after Tuesday’s 3-0 loss against Chelsea.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told the club the value of the transfer of Marcus Rashford would be “great” as the Spanish media have responded poorly to his latest ...",
      "Barcelona reportedly feel Chelsea star Pedro Neto fits perfectly into their system, as there’s uncertainty over the future of Marcus Rashford despite praise from boss Hansi Flick."

      "Santos superstar Neymar “could really boost” Man Utd if they could sign the Brazil international in the January transfer window, according to Louis Saha.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all joined and there has been some improvement but Man Utd are still a long way away from the finished article under Amorim.",
      "Neymar, who returned to boyhood club Santos in January from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, has been linked with Man Utd a lot in the past and Saha reckons he could provide the Red Devils a “boost’ as a winter move for the Brazilian is mooted.",

      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "“It’s sad, because I love Neymar. I thought a couple of years ago it’d have been a perfect move because he can still be an amazing player. He could really boost United with his inventiveness and talent.",
      "“I think perhaps the way he has had his career guided needed to be challenged in the past. I don’t know how he can set about putting things right and rebuilding anymore. United need players who will sacrifice themselves for the team, who are in love with the club. I’m not sure Neymar is the man to offer that to United at this point in his career.”",
      "When asked whether Man Utd should go into the transfer market again in January, Saha added: “If they find the right target, yes. If they don’t, they have to take the hit and miss out this winter. The market has not been the easiest one for many years. So they need to take their time, and not act just for the sake of it. They need real purpose in the transfer market.",
      "“They have to be very deliberate about who they recruit. You need to find the right people, the right players. Players need to have a bit of fire to play for Manchester United.",
      "“They need to want to play for Man United more than anything, and this is what they have really done well in the summer. They signed players who really want to play, and don’t think about themselves only.",
      "“So there are elements of joy to see that they’re completely in line with the mission, and the challenge ahead. They’ve stopped looking at players who just see United as a stepping stone. That doesn’t work. I think if they find the right players, they can act, but they don’t need to add players just for the sake of it.”",
      "Neymar has been linked with a transfer to England, Major League Soccer and various other places and former USMNT star Brad Friedel has suggested he could link up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Inter Miami.",
      "Friedel told Goal: “If Neymar is fit, then I think it works, I really do because he’s still a huge name in certain parts of the US. The trouble is if he’s not fit and he’s injured a lot, then it becomes a negative media-driven reality. I can understand arguments on both sides for sure.",
      "“I would assume, and these are smart guys, it would be a tiered contract based on performances and being fit. Having spent some time in Miami, before Messi came you wouldn’t have really known that Miami had a team. From the time that he came, there are pink and black shirts everywhere.

      "Wednesday 3 December 2025 19:09, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas.",

      "Arsenal vs Brentford - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Arsenal were not themselves at Chelsea. They were off the pace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Several misplaced passes in the build-up phase and they lost the duel battle to Chelsea. They lost two-thirds of their first 24 duels in the opening quarter of the game, while they only won one of the first 10 aerial duels.",
      "There were several factors behind it. Chelsea played well - having had an extra day to prepare after their midweek European action - while the absences of William Saliba and Gabriel filtered throughout the team to create an unconvincing display.",
      "It has also been a busy schedule. \"It's been a big week,\" said Mikel Arteta after overcoming the triple header of Spurs, Bayern Munich and the Blues last week. So is it time for the Arsenal manager to rotate?",
      "Wednesday night's visit of Brentford may be a good opportunity to give minutes to those who need it, but more crucially rest those who have been called upon a lot.",
      "For example, Ben White could come in for Jurrien Timber. The likes of Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres are aiming for first starts after injury. Even Christian Norgaard, against his former club, and Ethan Nwaneri could be called upon.",
      "Brentford's record against the bigger sides makes them a decent test so there cannot be wholesale changes. But one thing the Bees are good at is winning duels via first and second balls. Arsenal will need fresh legs more than on-pitch quality.Sam Blitz",
      "Liverpool vs Sunderland - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It cannot just be a coincidence that Liverpool kept their first Premier League clean sheet since they beat Aston Villa a month ago - and only their third all season in the top flight - in their much-needed win at West Ham United on Sunday in a game that also saw Joe Gomez make his first league start in almost a year, incidentally also in a victory at the London Stadium.",
      "Despite a series of calamitous recent defensive displays, including a 3-0 loss to struggling Nottingham Forest, followed by a 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven - both at Anfield - in the lead-up to the game, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had been stubbornly resisting calls to start Gomez, who has been carrying a slight knee niggle of late.",
      "But the versatile 28-year-old returned on the right-hand side of the champions' defence in east London, with the Reds immediately looking more assured at the back, with no visiting player making more interceptions, while he also created their second goal for Coady Gakpo.",
      "Fitness permitting, expect Liverpool's long-serving player to still be in the hosts' starting line-up when high-flying Sunderland visit Anfield.",
      "Richard Morgan",
      "Burnley vs Crystal Palace - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Only two Premier League teams have missed more than 25 big chances this season - Crystal Palace are one of them.",
      "With 26, Palace have a major problem with converting the big opportunities they are managing to create.",
      "Oliver Glasner bemoaned his side's lack of business, calling for some level of sympathy as his side tired in their defeat to Manchester United. However, in their ascendancy, Palace failed to capitalise on a rampant first half, which could be costing them more than their squad depth.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta, who took his tally of big chances missed up to 12 against United, is only behind Erling Haaland for big chances spurned.",
      "Creativity was the main concern for Palace when Eberechi Eze moved on to pastures new in the summer. However, creating isn't what's holding Palace back; it's their inability to score.",
      "Burnley will provide the sternest test of Palace's ability to find the back of the net. Scott Parker's Clarets have the league's highest expected goals against with 28.79, meaning - on paper - there will be ample opportunity to exorcise their big-chance demons.William Bitibiri",
      "Wolves vs Nottingham Forest - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Wolves are in trouble. As we enter the final month of the year, they remain winless. It's a dismal start that has seen their foreheads pressed against the barrel of a relegation to the Championship.",
      "Defeat at Forest would mean that they have lost seven straight matches in the top flight.",
      "The last time the club fell to that many defeats was during the 2011/12 season, during Terry Connor's infamous reign, which was an all-time low in a relegation season.",
      "The records are likely to compound if fortunes fail to turn at Molineux. Wolves are on target to lose 32 matches this season.",
      "Derby County in 2007/08, statistically the Premier League's worst team, had six points recorded by this point while Wolves have two. They are on track to take Derby's crown.",
      "Only once has a team recorded lass than two points at this stage in Premier League history and that was Sheffield Wednesday, who had one and were ultimately relegated. While the chances of a Wolves survival remain slim, fans will hope to retain some semblance of respectability starting with Forest on Wednesday.William Bitibiri",
      "Leeds vs Chelsea - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "This is a fixture packed with history - and plenty of thumping tackles and intensity. The 1970 FA Cup final replay was the most fearsome of all but expect another boiling hot atmosphere at Elland Road when the sides meet again on Wednesday.",
      "Can Enzo Maresca's side keep their heads in the pressure cooker?",
      "The midfielder will be suspended for the Leeds trip but ill-discipline is becoming a theme for this Chelsea team. There have been six red cards shown to Chelsea players this season. Their four in the Premier League is twice as many as any other side.",
      "Even Maresca has served a suspension after being sent to the stands for his jubilant celebrations of Estevao's last-gasp winner against Liverpool.",
      "It's a concern which really came into focus at the back end of last season, when Nicolas Jackson saw red at Newcastle, Chelsea were beaten, and the race for a Champions League place was went right down to the wire.",
      "Against Arsenal, Chelsea battled valiantly with 10 players. A point gained? Or was it two dropped, given how they had started the derby with 11?",
      "There's a lot to like about the team Maresca has built at Chelsea - but they can be their own worst enemy and must keep the focus to maintain their positive start to the season at Leeds.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Brighton's unbeaten home record faces its toughest test yet with the visit of in-form Aston Villa.",
      "Both sides started the campaign slowly, earning just one win between them from their opening five games, but now they're firmly in the race for European football.",
      "Villa recorded their fifth clean sheet of the season on Sunday and have the second-best defensive record in the division, although at the other end of the pitch, they're not having so much joy.",
      "They're second bottom for xG while Ollie Watkins has scored just once and was dropped for the victory at Wolves, with Donyell Malen preferred. The quick turnaround may see Watkins reintroduced from the start.",
      "There's been no such issues for Brighton striker Danny Welbeck, who has only been getting better at 35. His seven goals, combined with the efforts of Yankuba Minteh, have powered Fabian Hurzeler's side up the table.",
      "The winger has the second-most assists and touches in the opposition box in the league, with only Jeremy Doku and Mohammed Kudus having completed more dribbles. Villa's defence will have to be at its best.David Richardson",
      "Man Utd vs West Ham - Thursday, kick-off 8pm",
      "Manchester United may have picked up a crucial away win at Selhurst Park on Sunday, but Old Trafford will be expecting far more come Thursday night.",
      "The embarrassment that was the defeat to 10-man Everton will still be at the forefront of the minds of the fans and Ruben Amorim.",
      "The performance and the way Everton kept out a limp Red Devils provides Nuno Espirito Santo with the blueprint for how to get a result. That means there has to be a marked change from the hosts, perhaps even in personnel.",
      "United are expected to dominate the ball against the team who have had less possession in all but two of their away Premier League games this term. The anomalies being against promoted sides.",
      "Amorim will need players on the pitch who can break down the Hammers. That may present an opportunity to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old has only been afforded 171 minutes in the Premier League this season. It is a far cry from the role he had at the time of scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "However, United have consistently struggled with breaking down low blocks and Amorim won't change his system.",
      "If his stubbornness on the front is going to persist, the dice needs to be rolled one way or another.",
      "There is a question as to whether the defensive presence of Casemiro is as vital for this game compared to against the likes of Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later this month.",
      "Keeping the Brazilian fresh for those must be a priority, so the door may open for Mainoo to make his first league start of the season and show once and for all he is deserving of more from Amorim heading into 2026.",

      "The midfielder rifled in from a well-worked set-piece after being teed up by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",
      "Crystal Palace:  Henderson (4), Munoz (5), Richards (6), Lacroix (6), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Wharton (6), Kamada (6), Pino (6), Sarr (5), Mateta (7)\n\n\nSubs:  Lerma (5), Nketiah (4), Uche (6), Hughes (6), Devenny (6).\n\n\n Man Utd:  Lammens (5), Dalot (5), Yoro (3), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Amad (6), Casemiro (5), Bruno Fernandes (7), Mbeumo (6), Mount (8), Zirkzee (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Mazraoui (6), Martinez (n/a), Dorgu (n/a), Mainoo (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mason Mount",
      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"It [Joshua Zirkzee's goal] was really important.",
      "\"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half, he struggled in the duels, and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",
      "\"Asked about Sarr's condition in his post-match press conference, Glasner said: \"The ankle is quite swollen, so I think he will miss a few games, maybe the whole time until he goes to AFCON.\"",
      "\"Senegal start their AFCON campaign on December 23, when they face Botswana in Tangier, Morocco. If Pape Thiaw's side make it as far as the final, Sarr would not return to domestic action until late January or early February.",
      "\"Glasner has already made it clear Palace must strengthen in January, with an attacker at the top of his shopping list - and now it appears to be even more imperative than before.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner:",
      "\"What disappointed me? Almost everything.",
      "\"Conceding two goals from set-plays, three of the last four goals being conceded from set-plays. That makes it really frustrating, because I think we played a very good first half, and deserved to have the lead.",
      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are \"soft\" defending their own box, adding there is little time afforded at the club to find consistency and wins - so they must happen now.",
      "At Nottingham Forest on November 1, Man Utd conceded twice in two minutes at the start of the second half. They went on to draw 2-2, the same result they had against Tottenham the following week.",
      "Against Everton on Monday Night Football, David Moyes' side - who played with 10 players for most of the game - scored with their only shot on target to beat Man Utd 1-0.",
      "This season, Amorim's side have scored and conceded the same amount of goals - 19 each - and the head coach has criticised his team's defensive play.",
      "Speaking ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace, he said: \"We have some results of not letting a lot of teams in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box so we need to improve that.",
      "\"Especially against Forest - we took a lot of crosses, we didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal but we suffered a goal with the only shot on target.",
      "\"We are there near the box, we have more players than Everton, we should be better. More strong on the duels and Crystal Palace are very strong on duels and when they have to defend, they are really strong.",
      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers. It's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that's a concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive. That is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's the way you see the game and understand that if you're better in this moment, you should have more points and the narrative will be different.\"",
      "After a run of three successive Premier League wins, Man Utd have not won a league game in November, and will be hoping to put this right at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "Amorim also pointed out that the pressure to win at Man Utd is more intense than at any other club, and it will take time to find consistency with wins - something not afforded to many.",
      "He added: \"I think it's clear it will take time especially in the Premier League when every club is prepared for everything. They are improving a lot.",
      "\"We need to win now. If not, something is going to change and we know that. We just need to be better.",
      "\"Look at our games - could we have won last game? Yes. We had everything to win it. Same thing against Forest, they were suffering, we had three unbeaten and we didn't win. Tottenham the same.",
      "\"It's the urgency of winning. It's not good to be at United and not winning - there is no time here. That's why I'm frustrated all the time. We know we need time, but there is no time here so let's do everything to win games.\"",
      "There were also questions over Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to find himself with a regular starting spot at Man Utd. He was one of England's shining lights at Euro 2024, but his lack of game time at club level has seen him on the periphery of contention for next summer's World Cup.",
      "On Monday, he played half an hour against Everton, and while Amorim does not rule him out as a starter in the future, his focus is on positive results.",
      "\"This is a team sport. I have a lot of players in my squad, they want to be in the World Cup,\" he said.",
      "\"I put Kobbie [on against Everton] because he's really good near the box. Between Bruno [Fernandes] and him, he can find spaces near the box and score goals so that was my idea.",
      "\"I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try and win. I'm not focused on one individual, I'm focused on all my players and I know how special it is to play at a World Cup.",
      "\"My job is to win as a team and focus as a team. Kobbie Mainoo is in the same situation as the other guys - if I feel that's best to win the game, I will do it.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other guys. I just have to make a choice and in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. I just want to win games, I don't care who is playing.\"",
