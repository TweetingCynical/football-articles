      "Bryan Mbeumo has been urged to pick a move to Tottenham over Manchester United as the battle for his signature heats up. United are hoping to make the in-demand Brentford forward their next summer signing in a deal worth £60million after already capturing Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "However, Tottenham are understood to be attempting to lure Mbeumo to north London instead. Brentford boss Thomas Frank is expected to be appointed to replace Ange Postecoglou at Spurs next week.",
      "And it's understood that the Dane is eager to take Mbeumo with him, despite United holding extensive talks with the 25-year-old over a switch to Old Trafford. The Cameroon international now has a big decision to make, with the Red Devils ready to offer him a more lucrative deal, but Spurs holding the advantage of Champions League football and the potential of continuing to work with Frank.",
      "A former United goalkeeper has now weighed in on what Mbeumo's next move should be, and has surprisingly encouraged him to pick Tottenham. Ben Foster, who played for United between 2005 and 2010, believes Spurs have more potential for success under Frank next season and will help him to develop as a player.",
      "\"I would say that if you want to be part of something that's going to make you a better footballer and work hard and be part of a team, then go to Spurs with Thomas Frank,\" the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said on his Fozcast podcast.",
      "\"If you are happy picking up your wages knowing that there's going to be an awful lot more pressure, a lot more eyes on you, a lot more judgement and failure is just part of what they do, then you'd go to Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo has caught the eye of a number of Premier League teams after bagging 20 league goals over the past season. His seven assists were also important in helping Brentford finish in the top half, and a previous bid to sign him by Newcastle was rejected back in January.",
      "United have so far made two bids for Mbeumo, who is said to be open to a move, despite the club's poor start to life under Ruben Amorim. But a deal has yet to be struck with Brentford, potentially allowing Spurs to steal a march on their rivals.",
      "Foster has backed Mbeumo to have a big impact regardless of where he plays next season. The former England international made his prediction after praising his attitude.",
      "\"I'm not questioning Bryan Mbeumo about his ability, about his mentality or about what he's like as a person,\" Foster said. \"There's nothing to show me that I should have any worries about it. Whoever he goes and plays for, I think he would improve them and he gets into the starting line-up.",
      "\"He's got a proven record of being fit and scoring goals. He could get into pretty much all of the 20 Premier League teams and I think he starts, that's how good I think Bryan Mbeumo is.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a year left on his contract at Brentford with the option of an extra year. United's offer is said to be worth around £150,000-a-week for the player, rising to £200,000-a-week with add-ons, while Spurs are prepared to give him a basic package of around £130,000-a-week.",

      "Marseille star Adrien Rabiot has revealed how he twice rejected a Manchester United move despite holding progressive talks with the club. The midfielder, 30, cited the club’s fall from grace as the reason, saying “they’re in a bit of a hole”.",
      "Rabiot made 31 appearances in his first campaign with Marseille this season. He helped them secure a spot in next season's Champions League by finishing a distant second in Ligue 1 to his former side, Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Yet, Rabiot’s career could have taken a very different path both last year and once previously. In an interview with The Athletic, he revealed details surrounding his positive discussions with United on two occasions before ultimately deciding against a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The France international said: \"It really could have happened two years ago, when I was coming to the end of my contract at Juventus and I finally decided to extend by a year.",
      "\"We had great talks, and there were written offers. But in the end, it didn’t happen. Last year as well, when I was free, they came back in again. I had good talks with them again.",
      "\"But it’s true that it was a bit tricky. The situation they’re in at the moment… I felt a bit of reticence about whether United were going to be able to go on and achieve great things. They’re in a bit of a hole at the moment.\"",
      "Both of United's approaches to Rabiot came during Erik ten Hag’s tenure as manager.",
      "The first time United reached out to the Frenchman, they had failed in pursuit of Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong the previous summer.",
      "And last season, United were again in dire need of a central midfielder to play alongside Casemiro or Kobbie Mainoo. After being turned down by Rabiot, they shifted their focus to signing Manuel Ugarte instead.",
      "The Red Devils forked out £42million on the Uruguayan, who had a mixed first season in the Premier League.",
      "Rabiot’s arrival would have been made even more complicated by the appointment of Ruben Amorim last November after Ten Hag was sacked. Under Amorim, he would have had to become used to playing in an entirely new formation – Amorim's trademark 3-4-3.",
      "The Marseille player would no doubt have been keeping a close eye on United’s dire state of affairs this season, where Amorim guided them to their worst ever Premier League finish down in 15th place.",

      "Former Manchester United starlet Mason Greenwood has been praised by Marseille team-mate Adrien Rabiot. The Frenchman claims Greenwood could have been like Jude Bellingham in regards to stardom.",
      "Having emerged from the Red Devils' academy system, Bradford-born Greenwood swiftly made an impression under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and became the club's youngest European goalscorer at the age of just 17.",
      "In October 2022, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coersive behaviour. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service later discontinued these proceedings, and all charges were dropped in 2023.",
      "Greenwood was suspended by United after his arrest and was sent out on loan to Getafe that year. A year later, he made the permanent switch to Marseille. In Ligue 1, Greenwood has flourished, scoring 21 goals to tie with PSG's Ballon d'Or contender Ousmane Dembele atop the goal-scoring standings. Though some of his antics haven't gone down well with the club's fan base.",
      "His peer in France, Rabiot, has now claimed that Greenwood is an \"exceptional\" talent, and that he could have had a brand image like revered England and Real Madrid star Bellingham.",
      "\"Mason is an incredible player,\" Rabiot told The Athletic. \"If he hadn't had all of his problems, I think he'd have an image like (Jude) Bellingham. Mason would be the star.",
      "\"Because he's an exceptional player. He can score with his right foot and his left foot, he has an exceptional shot, and he can dribble. We're very lucky to have him. When he's really focused, he does really great things.\"",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille finished as distant Ligue 1 runners-up this season and have therefore qualified for the Champions League. Greenwood aided massively in these efforts, though it has been made clear that he has little chance of being named in an England squad again, having made his debut and sole appearance in 2020.",
      "Bellingham, the subject of Rabiot's comparison, however, is talismanic for his country at the age of 21, two years younger than former Red Devil Greenwood.",
      "Steve McLaren, who endured a short-lived stint at the helm of the Three Lions from 2006 to 2007, has been trying to tempt Greenwood into switching international allegiances to Jamaica, whom he now coaches.",
      "As per conditions set by FIFA, players can switch international allegiances if they have not played in more than three competitive matches for a senior national side before turning 21.",
      "Greenwood only kitted out once for England, in a 2020 UEFA Nations Legaue match against Iceland, and is therefore eligible to switch to the Reggae Boyz if he pleases.",
      "\"We are in contact all the time, with him [Greenwood] and his family,\" admitted Jamaica manager McLaren, who took up his current position in 2024. \"I am very confident he only wants to play for Jamaica. It is up to him when he moves forward with that. The ball is in his court.\"",

      "In the swirling vortex of the summer transfer window, few names are burning as brightly as Viktor Gyokeres at the moment. The Swedish striker – Sporting CP's goalscoring phenomenon – has become the subject of intense speculation, with several Premier League giants circling like hawks.",
      "Manchester United, under the stewardship of Gyokeres' former boss Ruben Amorim, have now emerged as frontrunners to secure the 27-year-old's signature, drawn by his prolific record of 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese champions.",
      "Arsenal, Chelsea and even Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been linked, but it's a move to Old Trafford that looks likeliest as things stand, especially with the Gunners also focusing on Benjamin Sesko and Chelsea pushing for Hugo Ekitike, having already signed Liam Delap at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Gyokeres' frustration with Sporting has boiled over, with reports indicating the striker is 'furious' over a broken promise. He has an £84m release clause in his contract, though it's understood a gentlemen's agreement was made which would allow Gyokeres to leave this summer if an offer of around £60m was tabled.",
      "However, according to Portuguese outlet Record, Sporting are now reluctance to honour this deal, leaving Gyokeres feeling betrayed. The club, having signed him for £20m from Coventry City in 2023, now stand to make a significant profit, and are now demanding at least £67m.",
      "This, naturally, has sparked tension, with eagle-eyed fans noticing that Gyokeres has now removed all reference to Sporting from his Instagram bio. Though it must be said, he's also taken down mention of Sweden's national team and his sponsor, Nike.",
      "Sporting's revised asking price may shed light on why Arsenal – previously considered favourites to sign the Swede – have cooled their interest.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to demand a weekly salary exceeding £250,000. And when combined with substantial agent fees, any potential deal becomes a costly proposition.",
      "The additional £7m Sporting have tacked onto the transfer fee has only made the move more prohibitive, and may have sewn distrust among potential buyers. However, the ongoing tension between player and club could accelerate negotiations, giving United and others a chance to capitalise on the situation.",
      "In a bold move, Gyokeres has turned down a staggering £30m-a-year offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal, underscoring his ambition to compete at the highest level. The lucrative proposal, which would have made him one of the world's best-paid players, was rejected, with Gyokeres prioritising a move to one of Europe's top leagues instead.",
      "Al-Hilal, eager to sign a marquee striker, targeted Gyokeres after their high-profile pursuit of Victor Osimhen collapsed last week. Osimhen, like Gyokeres, is linked with multiple Premier League clubs and reportedly rejected a lucrative £650,000-per-week offer from the PIF-backed outfit.",
      "Their rejections signal a focus on sporting ambition over financial reward. That said, securing either player will still require substantial investment, and United must be ready to meet significant financial demands if they want to land a superstar forward this summer.",
      "United's pursuit of Gyokeres could have been finalised by now had the club qualified for the Champions League. Earlier this year, Amorim identified Gyokeres as his top attacking target and laid significant groundwork for the transfer.",
      "It's said the Swedish striker would have quickly agreed to join the Red Devils had they defeated Tottenham in the Europa League final to secure a Champions League spot. However, United's loss in Bilbao changed things. Fabrizio Romano reckoned a \"99% chance\", but as they prioritised Matheus Cunha, it has certainly never been that clear cut.",
      "Gyokeres is now weighing up his options. While he remains open to a move to Old Trafford, interest from overseas clubs like PSG, Juventus, and Barcelona could see him lured elsewhere.",
      "United are in frequent contact with Sporting and Gyokeres' representatives to negotiate a deal, but without Champions League football, their proposal could be less compelling than those of other clubs.",
      "Gyokeres' future remains a tantalising puzzle as the transfer window's first deadline approaches on Monday evening. United's hopes of luring him to Manchester will be buoyed by Amorim's close relationship with the player and the club's ambitious attacking overhaul, highlighted by the recent capture of Matheus Cunha and potential arrival of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, a late twist remains possible. Arsenal could re-enter the race if their pursuit of Sesko falters and he takes the Al-Hilal cash, while whispers of interest from other Champions League clubs both domestic and overseas add uncertainty to United's chase.",
      "Gyokeres' next move will not only shape his career but could define the ambitions of whichever club secures his signature. For now, United hold the edge, but in football, nothing is certain until the ink dries."

      "Ex-West Ham star Ravel Morrison has discussed the huge telling-off he received from Hammers' vice-chairman Karren Brady. Morrison joined the Irons in 2012 for a three-year stint which was mostly spent out on loan.",
      "Under Sam Allardyce, the midfielder showcased glimpses of his raw talent that had led many to label him as one of the country's most naturally gifted footballers. Now 32, Morrison's career has been a mix of brilliant individual moments and off-pitch mayhem.",
      "Talking on the Undr The Cosh podcast, the former Derby County player recounted how he found himself in hot water with Brady for driving to training without a full UK licence.",
      "\"So, obviously, I drove to training on a provisional license, and Karren Brady went mad. She went mad. I didn't do that again,\" Morrison said. \"Someone must have told her. Like, I had to apologise, pick up the keys, get someone to pick me up from the car.\"",
      "When quizzed if he’d bought said car before getting a proper licence, Morrison said: \"A provisional license. I didn't live that far from the training ground, so I thought I could just [drive to training] quick... but I didn't get away with it with Karren.\"",
      "Morrison revealed the reason he hadn't taken his test is that he struggles to navigate the theory section, claiming he wasn't \"the brightest\". However, he said he does have a Jamaican and Mexican licence - but not an English one.",
      "The one-time Manchester United prodigy often found himself in the limelight just as much for his extraordinary goals as well as controversial incidents off the field. Yet speaking to The Athletic in June, Morrison argued that the root cause of his issues was often simple errors such as oversleeping and missing training, challenging the more damaging rumours tied to his reputation.",
      "\"I just couldn't wake up sometimes,\" he said. \"They were easy mistakes to make - stupid mistakes, yeah - but it's not like I was out drinking in town every weekend and having fights. It was only once in a blue moon when I would be late.",
      "\"What I've found is that if you get a reputation early on, it can stick with you through life. Or it does with me, anyway.\"",
      "Morrison has struggled to settle in a career that has taken him to 15 different clubs since 2010. As well as spells in the UK with the likes of Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City, Morrison has been all over the world.",
      "He has played in Italy with Lazio, Mexico with Atlas, and also had stints with Swedish club Ostersund, Dutch outfit ADO Den Haag and MLS side DC United. However, he does have regrets.",
      "\"If I could go back in time I would change 90% of my life,\" Morrison said on Rio Ferdinand's Vibe with Five podcast in 2021. \"But you have to look forward, you can't think about the past too much.\"",
      "Morrison departed the Hammers in 2015 after making 24 appearances and scoring five goals, but has fondly recalled his stint in east London as an \"enjoyable\" one. \"If I had the opportunity I'd have stayed with West Ham all the way through,\" he said in February 2021."

      "Both stars have been on United's radar in the past. After a bitterly disappointing campaign that ended with a 15th-placed Premier League finish and Europa League final heartbreak, this summer transfer window is a pivotal one for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been poached from top-flight Wolves for £62.5million, having mustered 15 league goals this season. Yet another of Vitor Pereira's stars, Algerian full-back Ait-Nouri, has chosen the sky blue side of Manchester.",

      "Before he made his move from Angers to Wolves in 2020, the prodigious Ait-Nouri was reportedly of interest to then-Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Contact was supposedly made between the Manchester club and Ait-Nouri's super-agent Jorge Mendes, with whom he parted ways last month, and the teenager even flew to England to tour various training grounds, including those of United and their rivals City.",
      "In the end, neither of the two could secure the services of a young Ait-Nouri, who joined Wolves on an initial loan deal and signed permanently in 2021 for roughly £15m. At Molineux, the 24-year-old developed into a marauding wing-back and has now been snapped up by the Cityzens in a five-year deal worth £36m, with United missing out on their former target.",

      "Amorim, 40, managed a meagre seven wins out of 27 league games and subsequently missed out on European football qualification. Now, his relentless use of his preferred system has drawn criticism from Meulensteen.",
      "“I find it, in my personal opinion, a bit short-sighted in that respect,” Meulensteen said on the High Performance podcast. “I think if he worded it differently from the start, he would not have got hunted by it every single day because constantly the media will come back to him. ‘You’re losing again today, is it because of the system?’",
      "\"I think he should have said, 'Listen, I prefer a 3-4-3 system. I had a lot of success with it. I know it can work. I'm going to try to make it work at Manchester United. However, I need to have a look at the squad first. I need to look at how I can best use the players and utilise their strengths because that's what you need to do. And I need to get to know the Premier League and the opponents and everything.'",
      "\"There's so many variables that have an effect on whether that system is going to work or not,\" Meulensteen continued. \"So if he would have done that, he would have been more flexible in getting to grips with the size of the task anyway, never mind losing or winning games. Now, when you win games, things become easier, because you can get your message across easier.\"",
      "\"It is hard to say what kind of advice you would give him, because if he diverts from that, he sees it as a weakness,\" Meulensteen added. \"So that's why he's been, maybe, stubborn and stuck to it . 'I'm going to make it work, no matter what.'",
      "\"I don't think it would be a sign of weakness. He comes across a lot of times as very, very honest. Why couldn't you say, 'Listen I know I've said this. However, the experiences I've had over the last few months make me rethink and review. I genuinely believe that it is in the best interests of all of us–the team, the squad–-that I tweak a few things.'",
      "\"He has tweaked a few things, when he's played Garnacho in that number eight role on the left-hand side. He gave him the leeway to go to the wide areas because that's where Garnacho's strength is, and then run at people and come inside.",
      "\"I also do think that you never should stick yourself to one particular system, because a system is nothing else than a framework. How you're going to start the game. The moment the whistle goes, a 4-4-2 flows into a 4-3-3, a 2-4-4, however the game pans out. So that is not the most important thing.\"",
      "Regardless of whether Amorim makes a tactical switch or not, United are facing a crucial summer transfer window as they gear up for next season without the prospect of European football. The club have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are targeting Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo."

      "The late Brian Clough once punched Roy Keane in the dressing room, but that did not stop the fiery Manchester United legend from loving him. Before he became the explosive Red Devils captain that won everything there was to win, Keane played under Clough at Nottingham Forest, where he received the iconic manager's own brand of tough love.",
      "The two-time European Cup winner was the man who brought Keane to England, signing the Irishman from Cobh Ramblers in 1990. Keane quickly rose to prominence as one of the most promising young talents in European football.",
      "His journey under Clough was marked by many hard and, at times, physical lessons. One of those was brutally inflicted after an FA Cup third-round replay against Crystal Palace in 1991, where Keane made an error that led to them drawing at the City Ground.",
      "Reflecting on Clough's unique approach to management during a recent appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"He (Clough) played mind games sometimes. If you got beaten, you'd think he's going to go after you and then he'd go the other way and go, 'Have a few days off.'",
      "\"If you'd won a few, you'd be going, 'Listen, (I think we'll be getting) a couple of days off' and he'd be like, 'No, you're all in tomorrow.' He'd definitely be playing mind games.\"",
      "Keane reminisced about a stunning incident involving him and former team-mate Mark Crossley, who is widely known as 'Big Norm' around football. Keane turned to Crossley and added: \"We (had) the incident with me, you and the Crystal Palace goal where he punched me after the game. He'd give me days off and he'd be brilliant.\"",
      "One of Keane's worst moments as a player came in the final minutes of that FA Cup clash, when his short back-pass resulted in Crossley fluffing a clearance to Palace star John Salako, who proceeded to lob in an equaliser to force another FA Cup replay.",
      "At the time, penalty shootouts were not part of the FA Cup, so Keane's error meant Forest had to face Palace in the competition for the third time that season. Re-living that painful moment, Keane added: \"I'm looking and it was honestly like slow motion. You know about not upsetting the manager because we all loved Brian Clough. He gave us a chance like Norm did for me.",

      "\"He (Clough) blamed me for the back pass and it was the cup game. So then we went to a replay and he wanted the game done and dusted there. I think it ended up going to, three replays or something.",
      "\"So he (Clough) had the thought of having a free weekend and was going, 'Now I've got to go to London, all the way to London to play Palace in the cup game that we hadn't won.' So he blamed me after the match.\"",
      "Turning to Crossley, Keane said: \"I don't think you said much after the game. You just let me take the wrap for it. He (Clough) just punched me in the chest.\"",
      "Keane made 148 appearances at Forest between 1990 and 1993. He eventually left for United in a then British record £3.75million deal.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo was in tears once again as he celebrated winning his third trophy with Portugal, who defeated Spain in a penalty shootout to win the Nations League on Sunday. While Portugal have won the Nations League twice, their Euro 2016 triumph was unexpectedly sealed by Premier League flop Eder.",
      "The former Swansea forward came off the bench and stunned France with a long-range effort in extra time, a goal that would later leave Ronaldo crying in celebration. Eder had been shipped out to Lille after just half a season with the Swans, where he had failed to score in 15 appearances.",
      "Having rebuilt his reputation with the French side, the then-28-year-old forced his way into Fernanndo Santos’ squad after scoring six goals in 14 games. Becoming Portugal’s hero must have felt a long way off for Eder while the £5million signing was struggling in South Wales. However, Eder later revealed that he gained the confidence to score Portugal’s 109th-minute winner after a pep talk from Ronaldo as he waited to enter the pitch.",
      "Ronaldo had limped off injured after 25 minutes, but remained a significant presence throughout the game. He spoke to team-mates and patrolled the touchline alongside Santos as he looked to inspire Portugal to victory. It seemed to have the desired effect on Eder.",
      "“Cristiano told me that I would score when I came on and I just took that energy into my game,” Eder said after the final whistle. “We weren’t the best technical team, but we worked for each other. Since the coach arrived he believed this group could do this.\"",
      "Portugal defied the odds throughout the tournament, having remarkably reached the knockout stages courtesy of three draws in the group stage. An extra-time victory over Croatia and penalty shootout drama against Poland led to their only win in 90 minutes over Wales in the semi-finals. However, the manner of Portugal’s Euro 2016 mattered little to Ronaldo.",
      "\"Very happy, very happy,\" he said in the aftermath. \"It was something I tried for so many times since 2004, praying that I would get one more opportunity. The Portuguese people needed it and the players needed it.",
      "\"It is one of the happiest moments of my career. I won so many things with my club, individually. I always said that I wanted to win a championship with the Portugal team, to make history, And I won.\"",
      "Eder joined Lille permanently that summer and retired in 2022 following stints at Lokomotiv Moscow and Saudi Arabian club Al Raed. Meanwhile, at 40 years old, Ronaldo is captain of his country and got on the scoresheet in his team’s hard-fought win over Spain to win the Nations League for a second time following their inaugural victory in 2019.",
      "Spain’s Martin Zubimendi had opened the scoring, but Nuno Mendes quickly cancelled out his effort. Spain regained the lead through Mikel Oyarzabal before Ronaldo levelled the tie just after the hour mark. The Al-Nassr forward, who later confirmed he will not be moving clubs this summer, was taken off shortly before extra time.",
      "This meant, like Euro 2016, Ronaldo had to watch from the sidelines as the drama unfolded. Ruben Neves scored the decisive penalty, capitalising on Alvaro Morata's miss, as Portugal scored with all five of their spot kicks. After the match, Ronaldo expressed his delight at securing another international trophy.",
      "“It’s always special to lift trophies. Regardless of the fact that we’ve already won this competition, for me it’s like it’s the first,\" Ronaldo said. \"You know how passionate I am about being here, about playing for the national team, about wearing my colours. The suffering, the tears. It’s special.",
      "\"For our nation, for the Portuguese people here in the stadium, those who are in Portugal cheering for us... My children are Spanish, so they shout ‘Spain’ to make me angry. So it’s special and I’m very happy.",
      "\"Winning for Portugal is always special. I've won a lot of things, but there's nothing like winning for the national team. That's why I really wanted it. I even said at lunch that this generation deserved it and that we were going to win the final.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult, against a team like Spain , and I think we deserved it. This gives us confidence to go to the World Cup and see that it's possible to beat any team in the world.\"",

      "A chequered pattern of behavioural issues with former boss Erik ten Hag has been swiftly followed by periods out of the team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Waddle has hinted that Garnacho, 20, might not yet be as good as he thinks he is, suggesting even a change of clubs may not iron out the issues plaguing the forward. The Newcastle United legend argued that despite his potential, Garnacho should put his head down and focus squarely on his football as rumours swirl about a possible departure from Old Trafford.",
      "\"I was surprised they left him out of the Europa League final because I think attacking Tottenham is the best way of getting results,\" Waddle, 64, told online-casinos.com.",
      "\"And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "\"And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don't know, modern players, I don't know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren't playing.\"",
      "He continued: \"Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn't. Garnacho talks like he's got a million games under his belt.",
      "\"We know he's a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they're on the bench, well, that's a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "\"He's a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he's a senior player in his late 20s, but right now he's still learning. There's talk of him going to Italy – let's see how that goes for him.\"",
      "Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea and Italian side Napoli, who made a bid for the player during the January transfer window. Saudi Pro League team Al-Nassr are also reportedly monitoring Garnacho as a potential alternative to Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "However, the player himself has confirmed that he is currently in Italy. He posted a photo of himself outside the Colosseum in Rome, sparking rumours that he could be eyeing a move to Serie A.",
      "Garnacho has netted 26 goals in 144 appearances for United. Nonetheless, if he decides to part ways with United, he still has some time to secure his next move as the summer transfer window will briefly close on June 10, before reopening from June 16 until September 1."

      "Meanwhile, Director Giovanni Manna said: \"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project. In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juve who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganizing: these factors are fundamental.\"",

      "It has been reported that Sporting are asking for a higher fee that what the club is said to have promised Gyokeres to allow the striker to leave this summer. The Sweden international has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract but has been reported to be available for €70million (£60million).",

      "The start of Manchester United's pre-season campaign will be here before we know it.",
      "United are scheduled to play the opening game of their pre-season programme on Saturday, July 19, facing Leeds United in Stockholm. They will then travel to the United States for their pre-season tour a few days later.",
      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "The summer transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm on Tuesday evening, meaning Manchester United will be able to take stock of the steady progress they have made so far.",
      "The new Club World Cup format meant the window opened earlier than usual. It will reopen again next Monday and will remain open until September 1.",
      "United wasted no time in making their mark on this summer's window, announcing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves just 14 hours after the window had officially opened on June 1. He has arrived at Old Trafford after United activated his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Although no new arrivals are expected before Tuesday's deadline, that is not to say United's decision makers are going to spend the next few days with their feet up waiting for the window to reopen. In fact, they will be doing quite the opposite.",
      "United offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons. It is thought Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the one United paid for Cunha, meaning it could take a fee in the region of £60m to reach an agreement.",
      "But if United are successful in their pursuit of the Cameroonian and successfully lure him to Old Trafford, the expectation is he will occupy the right-sided No.10 berth. Cunha is expected to operate from the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo and Cunha occupying the two spots reserved for the playmakers means both Bruno Fernandes and Amad are set to be deployed elsewhere. Fortunately, they are both versatile enough to play in the centre of midfield and at right wing-back respectively.",
      "United need to add goals to a blunt attack and Cunha and Mbeumo would do just that after scoring 35 goals between them in the Premier League in 2024/25. For context, United scored just 44.",
      "As fantastic and as exciting as it would be for United to add Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha, they are still without the No.9 they so desperately crave. United have been linked with plenty of strikers in recent months, but the one name that has not gone away at any point is that of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "United's key to signing any elite-level striker this summer is via player sales. The prospect of them signing Mbeumo for around £60m before sanctioning any sales will almost certainly wipe out their entire budget.",
      "However, failing to sign a striker is a non-negotiable this summer. They are crying out for a reliable goalscorer and they simply have to buy one.",
      "In Gyokeres, United would be signing an established goal-getter whose numbers are just as eye-catching as Erling Haaland's have been in recent seasons. For all the talk about doing it in the Portuguese top flight, which, with respect, is not considered to be as demanding or as challenging as the Premier League, you can only judge a striker on his goals - and Gyokeres has scored a lot of them in the last two years.",
      "The prospect of United signing him and Mbeumo to join forces with Cunha in attack is exciting. Truthfully, it was fanciful only a few weeks ago.",
      "However, both Cunha and Mbeumo have expressed an eagerness to move to Old Trafford, highlighting the fact United still have plenty of pulling power.",
      "The midfield needs strengthening and there is a debate about whether Andre Onana should continue as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. However, right now, strengthening the attack is a far bigger priority. Three attacking signings could make the world of difference.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Gyokeres."

      "Slowly but surely an image of how Manchester United could line up at the start of next season is developing.",
      "Just over a week into the first stage of the summer transfer window and United have already wrapped up the signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha. They have now set their sights on attempting to lure Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford as well.",
      "To say United have made an ambitious start to head coach Ruben Amorim's first summer at the helm is an understatement. Cunha has arrived in M16 on the back of a 17-goal season in all competitions and Mbeumo netted 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Identified as a top target several months ago, Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford with the task of almost certainly filling the left-sided No.10 position. If Mbeumo is successfully drafted in, it is thought he will occupy the right-sided No.10 position.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning their decision to try and bolster their attack as their first port of call this summer is a wise one.",
      "Cunha, and possibly Mbeumo, would immediately add the goals that have been missing in previous seasons. Between them, they have plundered 56 goals between them since the beginning of the 2023/24 Premier League campaign.",
      "In addition to adding goals to the team, Cunha and Mbeumo would also strengthen the levels of competition for places. Despite Amorim often struggling to find a consistent and productive attack this term, it was not through a lack of options.",
      "United have a cluster of players who are capable of playing in either of the two No.10 positions: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee, Cunha and Amad.",
      "With Garnacho facing the prospect of being sold and Fernandes looking increasingly likely to be deployed as a No.8 next season amid Cunha's arrival, the size of that list will reduce, meaning Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee, Cunha, Amad and potentially Mbeumo will all be challenging to start in the two No.10 positions.",
      "Of course, each of those players are versatile to some degree but the majority will believe that is their best position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "If Mbeumo signs, Amad is highly likely to be installed as United's first-choice right wing-back and operate from out wide. However, Mainoo and Mount will be less assured of regular starting berths.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to force his way into the starting XI this calendar year, with his one-minute cameo against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final feeling rather telling about where he currently sits in Amorim's plans.",
      "Meanwhile, Mount started the last four games of the season, including the Europa League final. Amorim is a massive fan of the former Chelsea man.",
      "\"I'm so happy for him,\" Amorim said after Mount scored twice in United's 4-1 win over Athletic Club last month. \"He is such a player. He works really hard, he has quality.",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him.\"",
      "The fact he started the final four games of the season as one of the two No.10s confirmed once and for all just how highly Amorim rates him. Injuries, however, plagued his first two seasons at the club, restricting him to just 46 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Well-versed in a three at the back formation from his Chelsea days, it is understandable why Amorim is so fond of the 26-year-old. He is a tailor-made fit for his system and his understanding of what to do and where to be when United don't have possession is admirable.",
      "However, if United land Mbeumo, it is hard to see where Mount fits into Amorim's first-choice starting XI. Mbeumo and Cunha would occupy the two spots reserved for the No.10s and Mount is not a central-midfielder in this system.",
      "Competition for places is healthy and should never be frowned upon, but one of Amorim's most valued players may have to settle for a place on the bench."

Therefore, any deals that are struck following that deadline will not officially be completed until the transfer window re-opens on Monday, June 16.",

      "The prospect of Manchester United playing as few as 40 games next season means head coach Ruben Amorim will not have to rotate quite as frequently as he did last season.",
      "United's failure to qualify for the Champions League via the Europa League means they will only have domestic matters to focus on in 2025/26 in the form of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the League Cup.",
      "Not since 2014/15 have United had a season without European football. They successfully managed to get back into the Champions League for 2015/16 that season by securing a top four finish.",
      "Once again, United's main objective next season has to be securing European football for 2026/27. European participation brings a whole host of benefits, not least financially.",
      "However, one of the biggest advantages of United being out of Europe next season is that Amorim will not have as congested a fixture schedule to deal with, meaning there will be a lot of free midweeks to spend on the training ground.",
      "As encouraging as that could be as a collective, some individuals may find game time much harder to come by. United need to reduce the size of their squad and a whole host of departures are expected.",
      "However, the bulk of the exits United are planning for are in the attacking department, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony being identified as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho has also been told he can leave for the right price.",
      "The prospect of each member of that aforementioned quartet being sold will generate funds for United to reinvest elsewhere in the squad. They plan to sign Bryan Mbeumo, a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "One area which is not expected to be strengthened, though, is the centre-back department. After signing Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro last summer and then Ayden Heaven in February, United are very well stocked at the back.",
      "Despite the impending exits of out-of-contract duo Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, United still have five first-team centre-backs they can all upon in the shape of Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, De Ligt, Yoro and Heaven. Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw are also equally comfortable operating in the back-three.",
      "Injury issues meant United didn't finish the 2024/25 campaign with a settled defence, meaning pre-season is set to determine who will make up Amorim's first-choice back-three come the start of the new campaign in August.",
      "Amorim could find himself with four players believing they are worthy of occupying the left-sided centre-back spot. Martinez, both before and after United switched to a back-three, was the club's main left-sided centre-back.",
      "However, his season-ending ACL injury meant the position was occupied by several different faces in the second half of the season, including Yoro, Heaven and Shaw.",
      "Despite originally being signed to operate as the right-sided centre-back in a back-four, United's mid-season shift to a back-three was expected to see Yoro become Amorim's first-choice option on the right of his three-man defence. However, the Frenchman arguably produced his best performances for United so far on the opposite side of the defence.",
      "\"[Being] right footed is more easy for me sometimes on the right, but I really like to play on the left,\" Yoro said earlier this year. \"When I go inside, I can put a long ball to the striker, or in the middle, so I like both sides. It's no problem for me.\"",
      "Yoro has the capacity to become a staple in United's defence for many years to come, likewise Heaven, who has not put a foot wrong since arriving from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "Martinez will be hungry to reclaim the left-sided centre-back spot and make up for lost time once he recovers from his injury. He was just getting to grips with the demands of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system prior to his injury and will be keen to demonstrate his ball-playing credentials.",
      "If he can stay fit, Shaw will also be keen to muscle in on the conversation for a starting berth. Now that United operate with wing-backs, his main route into the team is at centre-back.",
      "With no obvious winner, pre-season could decide who wins the race to become Amorim's first-choice left-sided centre-back."

      "\"Well, then I stopped to think: ‘I didn’t learn to play football, I didn’t play in a World Cup in vain, I didn’t join the national team in vain.’ Everything has a reason, everything has a process.",

      "United suffered their nightmare scenario this month when Chelsea were unable to agree personal terms with Sancho and the winger returned to Old Trafford. While the Blues did pay United a £5m penalty fee for his services, the Reds are still left with a task of needing to sell a player on a high wage who also did not pull up trees in the Premier League this season.",
      "For United, this is ideal as the Reds have dealt with the Bundesliga club on multiple occasions and will feel that they can strike a deal quickly with them. What's more, they would not need to convince Sancho about the merits of moving to Dortmund - it is well known he is a big fan of the club.",
      "The only potential sticking point is over his wage and Sancho would need to show some leniancy to keep the deal alive. But United are staring at the real possibility of receiving the £25m that Chelsea were contracted to pay, from Dortmund, and an extra £5m for their troubles.",

      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo is also a target for United as Ruben Amorim and Co. look ahead to next season. Mbeumo may not be the only forward who United want to bring to the club this summer, though.",

      "A fresh update has emerged in Portuguese news outlet Record about Gyokeres' future. The report claims that the striker is not happy with the Sporting hierarchy amid continued speculation about his future.",
      "It has been reported that Sporting are asking for a higher fee that what the club is said to have promised Gyokeres to allow the striker to leave this summer. The Sweden international has a €100million (£84million) release clause in his contract but has been reported to be available for €70million (£60million).",
      "However, it has now been suggested that Sporting are seeking a fee closer to €80million (£67.4million). This, the report claims, has made Gyokeres \"furious\" after the aforementioned agreement with the club.",
      "The report concludes by claiming that Sporting are yet to receive any bids from clubs interested in signing Gyokeres this summer. The striker enjoyed an impressive season in front of goal last term, finding the back of the net 54 times in 52 appearances and helping Sporting win the Primeira Liga title and the Taca de Portugal trophy."

      "Over the weekend, though, the transfer was thrown into some jeopardy when Spurs announced the sacking of Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank was quickly established as their preferred successor. It is understood that Tottenham were informed by Frank that he would want them to battle for Mbeumo should he be hired and Spurs agreed that this would be a good idea.",

It was claimed that the Dane informed Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he would insist the club targets Mbeumo in the transfer window and the owner was on board with the idea.",
      "If Tottenham were to complete this deal for Mbeumo, they already have the perfect welcome gift for him. For his national team Cameroon, the 25-year-old wears the number 20 having worn number 19 for much of his time at Brentford.",

While United would not be able to offer Mbeumo the No.20 as it is currently occupied by Diogo Dalot, they could potentially go one better.",
      "The No.19 at Old Trafford is currently vacant having last been worn by Raphael Varane during the 2023/24 season.

      "Just over 24 hours after United announced the £62.5million arrival of Cunha from Wolves, it emerged Mbeumo had informed Brentford's hierarchy of his eagerness to move to M16. United have since held talks with the Londoners and had a £55m offer turned down last week.",
      "However, discussions remain ongoing and United are expected to lodge a new and improved bid for the 25-year-old, who netted 20 Premier League goals for the Bees this season. It is thought Brentford will demand a similar fee to what the Reds paid for Cunha.",
      "Understandably, the prospect of Mbeumo being added to United's attack has increased the excitement levels among the fans.",
      "With that said, here are four reasons why signing Mbeumo would make such perfect sense for United and head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "After turning to Italy for each of their last two attacking signings, it is nice to see United looking closer to home this summer. Cunha scored 15 goals in the league this season and Mbeumo netted 20, meaning they are well established in England's top flight.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, the duo have netted 56 Premier League goals between them, meaning they have established consistent records. Mbeumo, who has predominantly played out wide during his time at Brentford, has scored a respectable 42 goals in four Premier League seasons since the Bees were promoted in 2021.",
      "United last signed out-and-out attackers from Premier League counterparts on permanent deals in the 2017/18 season, swooping for Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. At this particular juncture, United are much wiser to go for ready-made talents that are already proven in England.",
      "United's attack has lacked a multi-functional operator in recent seasons, meaning the prospect of Mbeumo arriving from west London would add another string to their bow. Traditionally a right-winger, he can also play through the middle as a No.9.",
      "In Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, the expectation is Mbeumo would operate as the right-sided No.10, operating close to the centre-forward United so desperately crave. However, the Cameroonian is also capable of playing as a striker himself, meaning he could operate centrally if asked to do so by Amorim.",
      "Furthermore, his power, pace and aggression mean he could play on the right flank as a wing-back. He is also renowned for his defensive work and willingness to track back.",
      "With the exception of Amad, United do not currently have another left-footed player who can realistically operate as one of the two No.10s, making the club's pursuit of Mbeumo all the more understandable. The Brentford man is renowned for drifting inside from the right.",
      "Amorim, last December, outlined his personal preference to have a left-footed player in the right-sided No.10 role, meaning it quickly became easy to understand why Amad was often tasked with playing in that role after initially being deployed at right wing-back after Amorim's appointment in November.",
      "Also hinting that Amad's long-term position could be at wing-back, it makes all the more sense for United to pursue Mbeumo's signature. He is a perfect fit for the role Amorim so desperately wants to strengthen.",
      "Most importantly, Mbeumo will add goals to United's blunt attack. The Reds scored just 44 goals in the Premier League this season, meaning they only managed to score 24 more as a collective than Mbeumo did on his own.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular source of goals and assists in Brentford's attack since their promotion from the Championship four years ago, contributing 28 assists in addition to his 42 goals. Marcus Rashford (131) and Bruno Fernandes (113) are the only current United players with more direct goal involvements in the Premier League than Mbeumo (70).",
      "With that in mind, signing Mbeumo is a no-brainer. United need to inject goals, creativity and flair into their attack."

During the tour of Asia, Amorim admitted that he was not expecting huge amounts of business to be done due to the lack of Champions League football.",

      "What MEN Sport says: It appears that United are finally looking to address one of their most problems heading into next season. The lack of goals from centre-forwards this campaign was pitifull and it is no surprise to hear reports that Amorim is focusing efforts towards signing Gyokeres. We already know that the Swede fits Amorim's system perfectly and considering his sensational form this campaign, United would be mad not to look at the 27-year-old.",
      "It is understood that both Chelsea and Arsenal have made initial enquiries regarding the potential addition of Alejandro Garnacho to their squad. MEN Sport understands that United have informed Garnacho that he should seek a move away from Old Trafford this summer.",
      "TyC Sports reports that Garnacho's preference is to stay in the Premier League this summer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: When United told Garnacho that he could seek a move away in the summer transfer window, it is likely that their desire was for him to move abroad. Napoli and Bayer Leverkusen would have both been preferable options. The reality for United, especially if they want to spend considerable money on Gyokeres this summer, is that they will need to sell the likes of Garnacho to the highest bidder. In terms of the Argentine's case, a move to Chelsea or Arsenal would be more lucrative for United and as much as they won't like him going to a direct rival, at least they will get money to strengthen in the position that they want to."

      "",
      "8) Liverpool – £33.7m\nThey idle down on the list after the signing of Jeremie Frimpong and a new third-choice goalkeeper, but they will catapult to the top if they pull off the British record transfer of Florian Wirtz.",
      "",
      "7) Burnley – £35.22m\nLast season’s loans have been made permanent, with Bashir Humphreys the most expensive of the quartet. Now to persuade somebody not already in Burnley to sign for Burnley…",

      "6) West Ham – £35.4m\nPenny for the thoughts of Graham Potter, who inherited the ‘loan with obligation to buy’ deal that is Jean-Clair Todibo.",

      "5) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could hey add Jason Sancho.",

      "4) Real Madrid – £58.5m\nThey have dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Welcome to the big time, Xabi Alonso.",

      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and they are well on their way to making it a quadruple in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez.

      "",
      "20) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma sees Old Trafford as a ‘tempting destination’, does he? Or is it that the Italy keeper has been in contract talks with PSG for months and he isn’t getting what he wants so his representatives are pulling the oldest trick in the agents’ book? You decide.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "18) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. Just doesn’t pass the sniff test.",
      "17) Heung-min Son – Tottenham Hotspur to Al-Hilal\nThe Saudi Arabian club are desperate to make a statement signing and the Spurs captain could be perfect. He’s out of contract next summer as well.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Bayer Leverkusen\nThere was talk of interest from Newcastle, which was a move we could really get on board with. But a loan with a £67milion obligation always seemed a little fanciful on City’s part. A £40million deal to replace Florian Wirtz at Leverkusen seems more like the kind of fee City would take for a player with no future under Guardiola, but we’d still rather Grealish stuck around in the Premier League.",

      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "13) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nChelsea’s first offer of £30million was rejected, with Dortmund wanting £40million, and the gap won’t be bridged before the Club World Cup. Expect the Blues to revisit this when they return from Infantino-fest.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",

      "10) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "9) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTottenham’s renewed interest threatened to scupper United’s hopes of landing Mbeumo but even the prospect of following Thomas Frank to Spurs isn’t deterring the forward from pursuing a move to Old Trafford. He’ll get his way ‘soon’, apparently.",
      "",
      "7) Kevin De Bruyne – Manchester City to Napoli\nThere was a hitch around image rights last week but, apparently, that has been resolved and De Bruyne is set to sign a two-year contract to fulfil his dream of playing with Scott McTominay.",
      "",
      "6) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool have improved on their opening bid of £109million by returning with an extra £4million. Leverkusen, as they should, are still haggling but the Reds are close. They’re hardly likely to walk away over a few euros and leave Wirtz hanging. The player will be looking for progress this week now there’s no international distraction.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "",
      "5) Kepa Arrizabalaga – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThis one is moving quick, apparently, with Arsenal aware that the world’s most expensive goalkeeper will cost them just £5million. Interesting one, this. Kepa recovered some credibility on loan at Bournemouth last season and won’t be going to Arsenal just to play second fiddle to David Raya. Bring on the Gunners goalie wars!",
      "",
      "4) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord last week was it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein says it’s done.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity have agreements with Cherki and Lyon and they are in a hurry so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed this week.",
      "",
      "1) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season."

      "These 10 Premier League players probably won’t be at the 2026 World Cup if they don’t move clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",
      "Is he joining Liverpool? No but…",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",
      "Move to a bigger club, play more consistently, even just slightly up his game – and Pedro could be leading the line for Brazil next summer.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "",
      "Federico Chiesa (Liverpool and Italy)\nThere is no chance Chiesa makes it to the World Cup if 2025/26 is anything like his miserable debut season at Liverpool. Fourteen appearances. Four starts. Arne Slot’s side won the title at a canter and barely needed him.",
      "A serious knee injury after Euro 2020 prevented Chiesa from kicking on when he was being touted as one of the best wingers in the world. There was talk of a £100m move to the Premier League but he ended up joining Liverpool for around £12.5m in 2024.",
      "He’s now a shadow of his former self, and rotting on the bench helps nobody. Not him. Not Italy. He needs to accept defeat – urgently.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot (Manchester United and Portugal)\nDalot’s slipped down the pecking order at United following Erik ten Hag’s departure – not because of favouritism, but because he simply doesn’t suit Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back formation.",
      "His form has nosedived. There’s more room for improvement here than with most others on this list, but if he’s not trusted as a wing-back and can’t play centre-back, he’s going to spend a lot of time on the bench.",
      "United are open to selling anyone. They’d have flogged Bruno Fernandes if he’d been willing to move to Saudi Arabia. With a World Cup looming, this summer is pivotal for Dalot and friends.",
      "",
      "Niclas Fullkrug (West Ham and Germany)\nLike Pedro and Brazil, the No.9 spot is there for the taking for Germany. Kai Havertz is a shoo-in as things stand – and that’s not even his natural position. Then again, what is?",
      "West Ham’s 2024/25 season was a disaster. Fullkrug’s assessment of their “s**t” performances was the most entertainment they offered. The German needs service to score – and hasn’t had any. He didn’t adapt, and poor seasons from Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and co. didn’t help.",
      "A swift return to the Bundesliga could be perfect. He scored 12 and assisted eight in 29 league games for Borussia Dortmund in 2023/24, and has 14 goals in 22 caps for Germany. If he stays at West Ham, the only justification for calling him up would be that goal record.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool and England)\nGomez feels like a stellar squad player option for England, but even that might be out of reach if he spends another season doing next to nothing at Liverpool.",
      "It’s a surprise he hasn’t pushed for a move already. There’s no sign of him flying up Arne Slot’s defensive pecking order – not as a right-back, centre-back or left-back. That versatility makes him valuable for club and country. But not if no-one’s using it.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho (Manchester United and England)\nBack to square one, then? Where does Sancho go from here? A permanent exit from Manchester United is inevitable, but who’s going to take him?",
      "Swallowing his pride and moving to a West Ham or Crystal Palace might be his best option in the Premier League – they can offer European football, which United can’t. But it might be smarter to head abroad again. Borussia Dortmund gave him a lifeline and he repaid them by helping them reach a Champions League final. Maybe they’ll do him a favour again.",
      "Either way, Sancho needs to be playing regularly and impressively if he wants even a sniff of a World Cup return. Right now, he’s not even in the conversation.",

      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",

      "‘Another source close to the process confirmed that at the beginning of the season there was a meeting between Frederico Varandas and Sporting’s former football director, Hugo Viana, with Gyökeres and his agent, in which it was explained to the player that the club would not demand the value of the termination clause due to his age (at the time of the events, 26 years old), without the president of the lions having set a value to release him.",

      "Foot Mercato journalist Santi Aouna confirmed a week ago that the Man Utd and Real Madrid legend will remain at Al-Nassr but that he will be ‘the main decision-maker’ in the transfer market.",

      "Garnacho has caused unrest in recent weeks with a video appearing to show him push past a fan on the street on the Red Devils’ tour of Southeast Asia.",
      "Before that incident, the Argentina international had called the season at Man Utd as “sh*t” and questioned why Ruben Amorim hadn’t started him in the Europa League final.",
      "And Fichajes adds that Al-Nassr have now ‘activated its radar to sign’ Garnacho with Ronaldo ‘key to this potential transfer’ as the Man Utd youngster considers the Portugal star as his ‘greatest inspiration in football’.",

      "Waddle told online-casinos.com: “I was surprised they left him out of the Europa League final because I think attacking Tottenham is the best way of getting results. And it looked like they were a little bit cagey. The formation United played. It was lacking in the creativity and directness you want.",
      "“And when Garnacho came on, he looked very lively. But I don’t know, modern players, I don’t know if they get ahead of themselves. Instead of playing their football and keeping their emotions in check, they set themselves up for problems. They ask in public why they aren’t playing.",
      "“Garnacho might look good in training, and maybe Ruben Amorim would want to pick him, but he doesn’t. Garnacho talks like he’s got a million games under his belt.",
      "“We know he’s a talented football player, but I think players at his age need to get their heads down, and if they’re on the bench, well, that’s a sign they need to improve to convince the manager. Just shut your mouth, get on with it.",
      "“He’s a young player with a lot of years ahead of him, and if a manager thinks you need pulling off, you accept it. He talks like he’s a senior player in his late twenties, but right now he’s still learning. There’s talk of him going to Italy – let’s see how that goes for him.”",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo picking this abysmal version of Manchester United over Champions League teams has boggled minds but there is plenty of precedent.",
      "While Cunha has joined from Wolves with little competition for his signature, the revelation that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United, a team which finished five places lower than the Brentford side for which he scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has confused many.",
      "Newcastle, Spurs and Arsenal were all linked with the Cameroonian forward but it is hardly the first time Manchester United have beaten Champions League clubs to a signing despite having no Champions League football to offer themselves. Plenty of other clubs have managed it too.",
      "",
      "10) Bruno Guimaraes\nThe spot could just as easily go to Alexander Isak, but Newcastle were at least on an obvious upward trajectory when they shattered their transfer record to sign the Swede from Real Sociedad in August 2022.",
      "The Magpies would qualify for the Champions League at the end of that season, with Isak’s goals a critical factor in helping transform Eddie Howe’s side. Yet it was Guimaraes who boarded the ship when the shore was a speck in the distance.",
      "Newcastle were in the relegation zone below Norwich when they somehow tempted Guimaraes to turn his back on long-term interest from Arsenal, the Brazilian having also popped up on radars at Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "“We are definitely going to be a club that is going to be a big power in world football,” said Guimaraes, and while it seems obvious in hindsight, in the exciting but uncertain post-takeover haze, it was far from guaranteed that Newcastle would embark on a revolution he helped kickstart.",
      "",
      "9) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nThings did not work out in a way that suited any party. The captain’s armband was stripped, the non-negotiables were ignored, backs were stabbed and the contract Arsenal were desperate for Aubameyang to sign after winning them the FA Cup was written off months early.",
      "Yet for a time there was talk of statues, proof of leadership, the glory of trophies and the scoring of more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez in fewer appearances than Philippe Senderos.",
      "It is a truly imperious record for Arsene Wenger’s last signing as a manager. A club-record fee was needed to extract Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, the Gabon international departing as the Bundesliga’s Player of the Year in 2016 and Golden Boot winner of 2017. By the time it came to leaving Germany in January 2018, Arsenal were sixth in the Premier League and locked in the existential crisis that was their first year outside the Champions League since 2000.",
      "Aubameyang was supposed to be one of the building blocks placed in the foundation of Arsenal’s recovery; his removal ended up being part of the process in re-establishing their relevance as a force.",
      "",
      "8) Sadio Mane\n“If a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions,” Ruben Amorim told Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Jurgen Klopp ultimately put it best:",
      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",
      "",
      "7) Moises Caicedo\nLiverpool supporters consumed dangerous and absurd levels of copium to come to terms with Caicedo’s decision to reject them in favour of joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",
      "Pogba had his pick of clubs as a precocious and prodigious 23-year-old; both he and Manchester United might choose differently if given the option again.",
      "READ NEXT: Manchester United above Newcastle, Spurs, Atletico in ranking of transfer allure to new signings",
      "Paul Pogba has reportedly ‘held talks’ with a Champions League club after opening up on the “hell” of a doping ban which kept him out of football for 18 months.",
      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we look at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘advancing’ to secure their first summer signing ahead of a major squad overhaul."

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "Seven years later, Chris Davies and Glen Driscoll again jumped ship with Rodgers for Leicester, but the addition of first-team coach Kolo Toure understandably brought the overall package closer to £10m for a frustrated Celtic.",
      "The appointment of Rodgers alone cost the Foxes £6m as they quickly identified and secured their main target to replace the sacked Claude Puel in February 2019. It immediately felt like a potentially bounteous union and for a long while proved as such.",

      "There was silverware in the form of the FA Cup and consecutive European campaigns only look more impressive the further Leicester in their current guise spiral out of control.",
      "But it ultimately ended in relegation heartbreak, with Rodgers sacked shortly before a drop into the Championship. The manager was due a pay-off of around £10m but is thought to have foregone some of that payment. Being replaced by Dean Smith does that to a man.",

      "Ruben Amorim – £9.25m\nThere was a similar sense with Amorim that Manchester United might have found a perfect match; that feeling lasted about a fortnight.",
      "Amorim had been on the Old Trafford radar for months, including through the hilariously bungled backing and sacking of Erik ten Hag, but it was decided that one final summer transfer window of recruiting at great expense more players specifically wanted by the Dutchman and entirely incompatible with his eventual successor was the best and indeed only possible course of action for a club which believes free lunches, charity work and employing non-footballers to be the problem.",
      "Sporting paid about £8m to release Amorim from his Braga contract after just 13 games in charge in March 2020 and it was a masterstroke: he transformed the Lisbon club to the extent that they won two Primeira Liga crowns after an almost two-decade drought, while putting them on course for a third before his departure.",
      "Manchester United wasted £21.4m on replacing Ten Hag with Amorim in November 2024 after threatening/promising the Portuguese that the opportunity to manage them would not come around again.",

      "All manner of low bars were dragged towards the centre of the Earth in an atrocious season which concluded with an embarrassing Europa League final no-show. The manager who so thoroughly out-coached his rival to procure the trophy and Champions League qualification with it was obviously ruthlessly dispensed with soon after; Sunk-Cost Fallacy FC doubled down on failure and rewarded Amorim with a £62.5m signing 11 days later.",

      "The Eredivisie runners-up were perfectly satisfied with a £7.7m fee and £1.7m in add-ons which might well have been triggered over the course of a Premier League-winning debut season. Liverpool, too, were content with a succession plan which convinced few outside the club.",
      "Among those might well have been Spurs, on whom the joke is contractually bound to always be. They considered the credentials of Slot in The Great Managerial Search of summer 2023, although when it was reported that Feyenoord wanted £15m or so in restitution, it does not requite a vivid imagination to envision Daniel Levy’s non-response.",

Jose Mourinho himself once referred to Villas-Boas as “my eyes and ears” so when the 33-year-old won the Primeira Liga, Europa League and Portuguese Cup, the comparison became unavoidably intoxicating.",
      "Roman Abramovich certainly agreed, sanctioning what was a world-record compensation package for a manager he would spend about as much to sack within eight months, at least partly because he tried to make John Terry sit in economy.",

      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",

      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
