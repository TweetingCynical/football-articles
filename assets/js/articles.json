      "Ruben Amorim has not even reached a year as Manchester United manager and he is already under huge pressure for his job.",
      "United’s 3-0 defeat by Manchester City on Sunday has seen a fresh wave of doubt over his future in the role. The loss not only surrendered local bragging rights, it meant United’s worst start to a season since 1992/93 and left Amorim’s record at eight wins from 31 Premier League matches since he arrived last November.",
      "Wayne Rooney has been among the high-profile names to openly question Amorim’s position, with the team having taken four points from four games in the league and been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby.",
      "Should those games not go to plan then United could consider sacking the Portuguese boss in the October international break. Here we take a look at the bookies’ favourites for the job and assess their suitability.",
      "The Crystal Palace manager has burnished his reputation recently by turning his side into a supremely organised and efficient machine. He led Palace to the FA Cup in May – an historic achievement which should have led them into the Europa League – and his leadership has been crucial to the side punching above their weight.",
      "The Austrian has worked with a tight-knit squad, getting the best out of them with little rotation. One thing that won’t have escaped the United hierarchy is that he plays a very similar tactical system to the one Amorim has been trying to implement. Should they pull the trigger on Amorim, that could ensure a smooth transition, with Glasner - who threatened to resign at Palace over the proposed sale of Marc Guehi to Liverpool - likely to continue with the 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "However, looking at it in a different way, that could be an issue. One of the biggest concerns about Amorim is how wedded he is to the three-man defence, which means fielding captain Bruno Fernandes in a two-man midfield. Hiring a new boss who subscribes to the same philosophy may not make sense.",
      "The former Manchester United midfielder is available after losing his job at Middlesbrough in June. The 44-year-old was at Boro for two and a half years, but left after they failed to reach the Championship play-offs last season.",
      "Carrick was previously an interim boss at United in between Jose Mourinho's departure and the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and served as caretaker after the Norwegian was sacked. Having spent 12 years with the club as a player and most of his years post-retirement at United as a coach, he wouldn’t take long to settle at Carrington and Old Trafford. He would be a popular choice among fans.",
      "However, there is no doubt that United represents a significant step up the ladder from Boro and the Championship, with the pressure involved and the need to manage egos a potential question mark for him.",
      "Southgate has been without a job since stepping down as England manager last summer. He is no stranger to being linked with the United job, having been on INEOS’ radar before. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a fan of Southgate’s and he was considered before Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag last year.",
      "The 55-year-old won plaudits for his work with England, where he built strong relationships with the players and became a good communicator. Having spent eight years in the Three Lions hot seat, he would command the respect of the United squad.",
      "However, there are bound to be question marks over his long absence from club football, which is a completely different job to that of an international boss. Southgate has only previously managed Middlesbrough – and that ended in 2009. Since then, he has only worked for the FA, first as England under-21s boss and then with the senior squad.",
      "Silva has a wealth of Premier League experience, having led Fulham since 2021 after stints at Everton, Watford and Hull. That longevity puts him third in the Premier League, behind only Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta and shows how much his work is valued in west London.",
      "The Portuguese is a pragmatist who bases his sides around structure and organisation and is not afraid to adapt his game plan to suit the opponents. While he may be able to conjure improved results in the short-term at United, there may be doubts over long-term progression.",
      "Silva has worked at mid-table Premier League sides for a significant period now and, although there is an argument which says that is exactly what United have become, INEOS may be wary of an uninspiring appointment.",
      "A left-field proposition, albeit one who has previously been linked with the United job and has admirers inside the club. Pochettino is now the head coach of the United States, who are preparing to host the World Cup next year, so is unlikely to jump ship back to club football in the Premier League.",
      "Pochettino’s reputation has taken a dent since his success at Tottenham, with spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea not working out. He has been under pressure with the USMNT recently and stepping into the glare of Old Trafford may not seem like a good idea for the Argentine.",
      "At his peak, Pochettino’s Southampton and Spurs sides were renowned for their high-intensity pressing and front-footed football. While that idea may appeal to United right now, it hasn’t been in evidence from a Pochettino team for some time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rene Meulensteen has selected Michael Carrick as the \"obvious\" successor to Ruben Amorim at Manchester United because he \"knows the club.\" The Portuguese manager has faced mounting criticism following recent performances at Old Trafford, particularly after a humiliating 3-0 Manchester derby defeat to City.",
      "That setback, alongside a crushing Europa League final loss to Tottenham and an embarrassing Carabao Cup elimination by League Two outfit Grimsby Town, has intensified the scrutiny surrounding Amorim's position at United.",
      "Despite the Old Trafford hierarchy's public backing of his capabilities, Mail Online reports that first-team squad members are beginning to doubt his tactical approach. It's believed United would face a £12million compensation bill should they choose to dismiss Amorim, though supporters might consider this a modest investment in the club's future success.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen has shared his perspective on the club's next move if they part ways with Amorim, identifying his preferred candidate for the role. Ex-Red Devils midfielder Carrick is being touted for the top position, with the Dutchman convinced the former Middlesbrough boss would thrive at his old club.",
      "Speaking to football betting site BetVictor, Meulensteen said: \"Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go. Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there.",
      "\"So he's still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what's expected from the club.\"",
      "The 61-year-old also referenced former United boss Jose Mourinho, who looks to return to Benfica, but remained steadfast in backing Carrick, insisting \"common sense\" is what's required to handle the troubled giants.",
      "He said: \"Well, you always get that and there's always names being thrown around. Jose Mourinho's out of the job as well. So that will be thrown around and there's all other managers as well.",
      "\"But the key is that you need to have a guy that obviously has got a clear idea but puts some kind of a structure in place that the players buy into and that you get a spark from the players. Because they're not bad players, there's plenty of good players there.",
      "\"I'm sure that if they would play in a system that suits them, they really play at the best. I think you could see a fantastic Manchester United. Maybe Michael could well be the guy.",
      "\"It's not magic. It's common sense more than anything, that's it and Carrick has got plenty of that.\"",
      "Carrick has previously stepped up as interim boss twice - following Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's departures - and remains unbeaten in temporary charge.",
      "Across three matches in the hotseat, the former midfielder secured two victories and one draw. He departed United to take over at Boro, where he spent three years managing the Championship outfit.",
      "From 136 matches in charge, Carrick claimed 63 wins, 24 draws and 49 defeats. In contrast, Amorim has had a tougher time with United, albeit under very different circumstances, with more losses than wins under his belt - 18 defeats compared to 17 victories, along with 12 draws.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was among the Manchester United stars, past and present, to back Jadon Sancho following his debut for Aston Villa. Sancho has had a tough spell at Old Trafford after his move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, struggling to replicate his Bundesliga success in the Premier League.",
      "Last season saw him loaned out to Chelsea, where he managed five goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Despite Chelsea's obligation to purchase Sancho for £25million due to their fourth-place finish, they chose to pay a £5m fee to return him to Manchester instead.",
      "With Sancho not fitting into Ruben Amorim's vision for 2025/26, he currently finds himself on loan once more, this time at Villa Park. In his first full outing for Villa, Sancho featured in a 1-1 draw against Brentford in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night, with Villa exiting the competition after a nail-biting penalty shootout.",
      "Despite the disappointing result, Sancho took to Instagram to share his enthusiasm for his new beginning, posting photos from the match with the caption: \"Happy to make my debut for @avfcofficial, not the result we wanted but something to build on.\"",
      "Young talents Ethan Wheatley, on loan at Northampton Town, and Joe Hugill, currently playing for Barnet, also showed their support, while former teammates Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jesse Lingard and Tosin Adarabioyo were among those who also liked the post.",
      "Aston Villa defender Ian Maatsen even left a couple of love heart emojis in the comments section. Sancho's loan move comes as he enters the final year of his contract with United, although the club can extend his deal by a year to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer.",
      "Sancho isn't the only player United have let go this summer after being excluded from Amorim's future plans. Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa before returning to his parent club this summer.",
      "He is now playing for Barcelona on a season-long loan, with the Spanish giants holding an option to make the move permanent for £20m. In other news, United have successfully sold Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea in a £40m deal.",
      "The Argentine youngster has struggled to meet expectations at Old Trafford in 2020, with reports of a falling out with Amorim at the training ground this summer. Now, the 21-year-old is adjusting to life at Stamford Bridge, having made his debut in a 2-2 draw against Brentford over the weekend.",
      "He may also get a run out in Chelsea's Champions League face-off with Bayern Munich on Wednesday evening, as Enzo Maresca juggles European and domestic commitments. Another player to leave United this summer was Antony, who secured a permanent move to Real Betis after a successful loan stint with the Spanish outfit last season.",
      "During his loan period, Antony netted nine goals and provided five assists for Betis, and Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping for more of the same this campaign, having snapped up the Brazilian for an initial £19m plus add-ons.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Despite finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final under Ruben Amorim, the Red Devils still managed to rake in revenues of £164.1 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to a record total revenue of £666.5 million for the fiscal year 2025.",
      "Commercial revenues stood at £88.2million, with total commercial revenues hitting a record £333.3million in fiscal 2025, the first year of United's five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon. Matchday revenues were reported at £37.2million, contributing to the record fiscal 2025 matchday revenues of £160.3million.",
      "The operating loss for the year was £18.4million, an improvement compared to the operating loss of £69.3 million in fiscal 2024. The club also highlighted a successful pre-season tour of Sweden and the United States.",
      "There were new sponsorship deals with Coca-Cola, Sokin and Parimatch, renewed partnerships with STATSports, Canon and Sportsbreaks, and the completion of the £50m investment in its Carrington training ground, which was finished \"on time and on budget, delivering world-class facilities for our players and staff\".",

      "Senne Lammens' brother harboured \"doubts\" about his deadline day switch from Royal Antwerp to Manchester United. The Belgian keeper sealed his move to United in an £18.2million transfer just hours before the summer window closed, having caught the eye in the Belgian Pro League.",
      "Whilst Ruben Amorim had initially maintained he was content to persist with Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana for the campaign, it seems underwhelming displays from the pair prompted him to reconsider his stance.",
      "And whilst countless United supporters will have been delighted to witness a fresh goalkeeper move to Old Trafford, Lammens' elder sibling, Tom, wasn't wholly persuaded that United represented the ideal destination.",
      "The 25-year-old, who turns out for Borsbeek in Belgium's lower tiers, told Nieuwsblad: \"There's a lot of quality, you play for trophies there, and Senne could probably immediately make his mark in the Champions League.",
      "\"I was initially sceptical about a move to United, because many players there had already succumbed to the pressure and couldn't reach their full potential. But ultimately, it was Senne who had to make the decision.",
      "\"United gave him the best feeling. Partly because Tony Coton, United's goalkeeping scout, had been following him for almost a year and was very convinced of his qualities. It would also be great if the club could return to its former glory and if Senne could contribute to that.\"",
      "Bayindir, United's current No. 1, has been struggling to meet expectations this season. The goalkeeper, who was favoured over Onana after appearing regularly in United's pre-season tour while the Cameroonian was sidelined, is yet to keep a clean sheet in the club's first four Premier League matches, conceding seven times.",
      "His performance was particularly criticised during United's season opener against Arsenal last month, where he fumbled a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to sneak in and score the winning goal.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan two years ago for £47.5m, is currently on loan at Trabzonspor in the Turkish Super Lig. The Cameroonian has also had his share of high-profile blunders since joining United.",
      "He was in goal for United's Carabao Cup match against Grimsby Town last month, where he conceded two goals before his side were knocked by the League Two team on penalties. His debut for Trabzonspor didn't go as planned either, with him being partly responsible for a 1-0 loss to Fenerbahce.",
      "As United gear up for another Premier League clash on Saturday, Lammens could make his first appearance for his new team.",
      "However, with United set to face an undefeated Chelsea at Old Trafford, the newcomer might have his work cut out unless Amorim can shore up his defence.",

      "Andre Onana has shown his true colours after leaving Manchester United on loan, despite his Trabzonspor debut not ending the way he would've hoped.",
      "The United goalkeeper found himself on the losing side against Fenerbahce on Sunday, as the Turkish Super Lig clash finished 1-0 to the second-placed side courtesy of a Youssef En-Nesyri strike just before half-time. Now, behind-the-scenes footage has surfaced of the shot-stopper voicing his thoughts in the changing room during the interval.",
      "Trabzonspor defender Okay Yokuslu received his marching orders in the 20th minute for a reckless challenge on Fenerbahce forward Kerem Aktürkoğlu, forcing his side to battle for over an hour with 10 men. Despite this, Onana refused to let the setback dampen his spirits as he was spotted rallying his team-mates during their half-time break.",
      "In the clip shared on social media, the keeper can be heard shouting: \"We have to win this game for him,\" before preventing Yokuslu from saying sorry for his red card, gesturing with his hands and declaring: \"No need for sorry.\"",
      "Numerous supporters responded to the footage, expressing their admiration at Onana's reaction and display of leadership in a squad he has only recently joined. One said: \"He's here to win.\"",
      "Another commented: \"He'll find himself there.\" A third added: \"Go to where you're valued.\" One supporter even suggested: \"Manchester United almost ruined him.\"",
      "Not everyone was impressed by Onana's rousing speech, though, with one frustrated supporter remarking: \"All this to lose 1-0.\" Another commented: \"Dude you just got here wtf.\"",
      "Whilst a third added: \"I've been in many changing rooms over the years... this looks to me like he interrupted the captain's team talk. However it went down, this is not a good look for him.\"",
      "Whilst the majority of fans welcomed Onana's reaction, he couldn't keep Fenerbahce out for long, as he pushed away a strike from former United midfielder Fred just before half-time. However, he failed to clear the ball from danger and reacted sluggishly to the follow-up effort that En-Nesryi scrambled home from close quarters.",
      "Whilst the backline offered little protection for the goal, it proved to be a moment the shot-stopper would prefer to erase from his memory. This blunder cast a shadow over what was an otherwise encouraging display from Onana during the remainder of the match, as he pulled off eight stops against Fenerbahce on his debut.",
      "This disastrous beginning will probably already be forgotten by the 29-year-old as he targets more positive performances during his temporary spell away from United. The goalkeeper was allowed to depart Old Trafford this summer following the club's deadline-day signing of youngster Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, with Ruben Amorim convinced Onana will flourish away from the demands of the Premier League.",
      "Discussing his decision to allow Onana to depart temporarily, the United boss said: \"We saw Andre had a very, very good season in Inter. The quality is there, but we are in the club sometimes, in the moment, things are getting harder and harder. And you can be really experienced.",
      "\"But in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. Sometimes you need a change. I think we understood that he needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, and it was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.",
      "\"I wish the best for Andre. He was really good at working, trying to help the players. Sometimes you can have all the quality in the world, but sometimes you need to change the environment to return to your level. That was a feeling, not just from us, but also from Andre.\"",

      "Jose Mourinho may be a Premier League legend but he's decided that his next job will not bring him back to these shores. The Portuguese icon is now closing in on a return to Benfica, but he has previously highlighted two conditions that could see manage in the English top-flight again one day.",
      "After just over a season with Turkish giants Fenerbahce, Mourinho was sacked in late August and found himself back in the market for a job.",
      "Reports in Portugal now say he is set to return to Estadio da Luz, the place were top-flight management began for him. His impending appointment came after Benfica coach Bruno Lage was sacked following the club's shock loss in the Champions League to Qarabag this week.",
      "Mourinho, 62, made an instant impact upon arriving in English football after he won the Premier League with Chelsea in the 2004/2005 season. This came off the back of a stunning Champions League triumph with Porto a season earlier.",
      "A second spell with the Blues, a marginally successful time at Manchester United and a stint at Spurs followed. Mourinho's love affair with the English game has often seen him touted to return to the UK, and he once claimed he would like to manage a team in the Premier League who are not involved in a European competition as well as one that's based in London.",
      "Mourinho fell foul of UEFA officials in a Europa League clash against United, while operating as Fenerbahce coach, in October 2024. After he was sent to the stands by the referee, the 62-year-old hinted at a return to England.",
      "Firing a barb in the direction of UEFA, his tongue-in-cheek remarks didn't stop the rumour mill from churning with clubs such as West Ham and Nottingham Forest rumoured to be circling Mourinho at the time.",
      "\"I think the best thing I have to do is, when I leave Fenerbahce, I go to a club that does not play UEFA competitions,\" Mourinho said. \"If any club in England from the bottom of the table needs a coach in two years, I am ready to go.\"",

      "The self-styled 'special one' and his entanglement with the Premier League saw him win three titles, three League Cups and an FA Cup with Chelsea over two stints. He also won the League Cup and Europa League with United after signing on with the Red Devils in 2016.",
      "A spell with Tottenham Hotspur followed in November 2019. While he didn't win silverware with Spurs he did guide them to the League Cup final, only to be sacked before the game itself.",
      "Outside of the UK, Mourinho won the treble, including the Champions League, with Inter Milan in 2010. A spell with Real Madrid from 2010-2013 wielded a La Liga title and a Copa del Rey.",
      "He made his way back to Italy with Roma in 2021 where he won the UEFA Europa Conference League. He also reached the Europa League final with the Serie A giants a season later.",
      "Mourinho is now expected to sign on with Benfica, taking him back to work in his home nation for the first time since 2004. However, it's fair to say that the door that could bring the enigmatic coach back to the Premier League someday is not closed just yet.",

      "Adebayo Akinfenwa hopes Alejandro Garnacho is \"just average\" with Chelsea this season. The Argentine struggled to find his footing with Manchester United last term before being deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "As a result, he found himself joining Chelsea in a £40million move this summer, with hopes of finding his stride in the English capital under Enzo Maresca. However, former Northampton, Wimbledon and Wycombe striker Akinfenwa, who is a long-time Liverpool fan, hopes he \"doesn't tear it up\" with his new club.",
      "\"I don't want to wish bad on him, but I hope he's just average. And the Liverpool players, I want to tear up everything.\"",
      "Akinfenwa also highlighted why he believes Garnacho struggled to make a mark with United before moving on to Chelsea, citing how the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs may have been too much for the 21-year-old.",
      "He added: \"The one thing I'd say is I can empathise, but I don't know the level of scrutiny at these top clubs. I know the levels of the clubs I was at and sometimes you're like, 'Oh, right.'",
      "\"Just sometimes being in a small city, I remember in Torquay and people knew where I shopped, and it was a running joke. I like my Bourbons and the manager was like, 'Oh, you was in there buying Bourbons.' But that's on a small scale. So I couldn't fathom the likes of the pressure that comes with a Chelsea, with a Man United.",
      "\"I think environments play a massive part and with different managers coming in, with the level of scrutiny, I think it's a lot of pressure and some players can deal with it, some players can't. We've all seen it.",
      "“I think Antony left Man United, went to Betis and hit the ground running. Some people may turn around and say, 'No, these footballers need everything to be perfect,' which again, I won't argue that point. But things need to go in your favour.",
      "\"That's on a day-to-day, especially being young, and having the weight and the pressure of the likes of Man United on his, and you do, you need a consistent base.\"",
      "Akinfenwa also suggested deeper issues at United may have a major effect on the performances of their brightest talents, instilling a belief that it has been shown time and time again that the club lacks a sturdy support system for developing talents.",
      "He added: \"You need a core support system, which is like, 'This is what we play, this is how we are.'",
      "\"Sometimes we'll be like, 'Oh, look, very emotion based.' But if you've got that core system that always allows, 'Look, this is the culture we set, this is what we do regardless, win, lose or draw.' I don't think Man United's had that for a long time. I think with [Marcus] Rashford, I think with [Jadon] Sancho, and I think with Garnacho, I think these are players where [this is clear].",
      "\"Again, [Scott] McTominay's left on one at Napoli. So these are elements where you're talking about, 'Okay, you know what, fundamentally, at its core, there's something not quite right with United.'\"",
      "Garnacho made his Chelsea debut from the bench on Saturday as the Blues were held to a 2-2 draw by Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, entering the fray in the 79th minute. He crucially lost his man, Fabio Carvalho, defending at the back post for the stoppage time equaliser.",
      "However, he may see more time to flourish when Chelsea take on Bayern Munich in their Champions League opener on Wednesday evening.",
      "It comes as Akinfenwa has teamed up with Tony's Chocolonely to become the brand's first-ever Bar Breaker in a brand new campaign. Speaking about his role, Akinfenwa said: \"I'm humbled to be the first official Bar Breaker for Tony's Chocolonely.",
      "\"You know their ethos, their look, chunky – I hear that people be struggling to break how chunky it is. So they have to come to Mr Beast mode to try and help the nation – both break the bar and then also try and get people to get on board with their mission. I do think it's a nice fusion, it's a nice balance. The official Bar Breaker!\"",
      "Adebayo 'The Beast’ Akinfenwa has been named Tony’s Chocolonely’s first official Bar Breaker. The Beast is motivating the nation to flex their thumb muscles to help more people enjoy more of the chunky, unequally divided bars with ease - ultimately bringing more people along on the brand’s mission to end exploitation in cocoa.",
      "Find out more on the campaign and join the mission via the Tony’s Chocolonely website here.",

      "The decision to let the talented 22-year-old go was met with criticism at the time, but Eddie Howe's side were forced to sell to meet Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules. In a simultaneous move, reserve goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos was transferred to Newcastle for £20m.",

      "There were concerns that Newcastle might rue letting Anderson go, given his potential to become a top-tier Premier League player, and it seems he's now living up to those expectations.",
      "Indeed, Anderson was instrumental in Forest's impressive seventh-place finish last season, earning them a spot in this season's Europa League. His stellar performances have continued this season, culminating in an England senior debut against Andorra earlier this month under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "After a standout performance that earned him the Player of the Match award, Anderson was rewarded with a second cap for England's match against Serbia, where he once again shone.",
      "With Anderson turning heads both at Forest and on international duty, rumours about his future are heating up. According to ex-United boss Brown, the Reds are mulling over a potential move.",
      "\"Man United have been looking at Anderson,\" Brown told Football Insider. \"He's done a tremendous job at Nottingham Forest and then he's come into the England side and turned in a man-of-the-match performance. United see him as exactly the type of midfielder they would like to bring in.",
      "\"He gets up and down the park, he's confident and secure in possession of the ball, and he's not afraid to put in a tackle which is something they need.",
      "\"Anderson would solve, or certainly help with, a lot of the issues they've had under Amorim. Everybody knows they wanted a midfielder in the summer but they couldn't find the right one who was available at the price they wanted.",
      "\"I don't know what Anderson would cost, but he is somebody who's been on their radar. He would be the ideal player to fill the gaps they've had in the squad.\"",
      "Reports suggest Forest rate Anderson at a minimum of £70m - twice what the Reds paid for him just over 12 months ago. At present, it's believed the midfielder has no intention of departing The City Ground.",
      "However, should he make the switch to Manchester, would Newcastle be entitled to compensation through a potential sell-on agreement?",
      "Chronicle Live believes the Magpies don't possess a buy-back option despite suggestions the club can trigger specific clauses in his deal with Forest.",
      "Should Newcastle want Anderson back, they'd need to pay the full market rate for the midfielder, with his worth rising after every display at present. It's been hinted that Newcastle may not have a sell-on clause in Anderson's contract, which could be a significant setback if he is sold for a hefty sum.",
      "Anderson wasn't the only player Newcastle had to let go last season to comply with PSR rules. The Magpies also offloaded Yankuba Minteh to Brighton and Hove Albion in a deal worth roughly £30m.",

In that instalment of the prestigious tournament, 837 players were involved in the scheme, leading to an estimated release of £8,012 per player, per day.",

The 22-year-old striker sealed a loan switch to the Serie A giants this summer after slipping down the pecking order at Old Trafford following the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Although Hojlund initially maintained he wanted to battle for his spot in Ruben Amorim's starting line-up, it quickly became apparent that the fprward would be afforded more opportunities elsewhere. The Denmark international moved to the Italian outfit for the campaign with a commitment for the club to purchase him for £38million next summer should specific conditions be fulfilled.",
      "There, he has reunited with ex-United colleague McTominay, who has been outstanding in Naples since his £26m transfer last summer. It seems McTominay has quickly re-established his rapport with Hojlund, as shown by an image Napoli posted this week from their encounter with Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "The club's official Instagram page uploaded a picture of the duo embracing, with the caption: \"From Manchester with love.\" Hojlund was swift to express his approval of the post, not only giving liking it but also sharing it to his Instagram stories, demonstrating his joy at being reunited with McTominay on the pitch.",
      "Hojlund appears to be adapting brilliantly in Naples, having got on the scoresheet alongside Kevin De Bruyne and Sam Beukema in the club's 3-1 triumph against Fiorentina. A fresh start could prove to be precisely what he needs, having previously impressed in Serie A with Atalanta before his switch to United two seasons ago.",
      "The striker notched 10 goals and four assists across 34 matches at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia before United swooped for him in a £72m transfer, though he struggled to make an immediate impact in the Premier League. Hojlund managed just four goals from 32 top-flight appearances last season, as United stumbled to a woeful 15th-placed finish.",
      "He'll now aim to recapture his goalscoring touch in Italy, with United pressing ahead without him for the 2025/26 campaign. Discussing the challenge that lies ahead following his loan switch, Hojlund revealed: \"I was very excited, because it's a team that just won the league.",
      "\"I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I'm very happy for this opportunity. It's different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I'm a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",

      "However, his stint at Old Trafford has turned into a complete disaster so far. He has managed to secure victory in 17 of his 47 competitive fixtures across all competitions - with only eight of those triumphs coming in Premier League action.",
      "Amorim's squad have also suffered a dreadful beginning to the current campaign, sparking speculation that he might face the axe sooner rather than later. Arsenal legend Paul Merson has now claimed Amorim would have suited Chelsea far better than Man United because of his tactical approach.",
      "\"He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto. They've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "\"You look at Man Utd and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.\"",
      "Despite the Red Devils' poor form, Amorim still has the backing of the United hierarchy. However, this could change if their dismal run continues.",
      "When asked about his position following the defeat to Manchester City, the Portuguese manager said: \"Guys, I understand that and I accept.",

      "Manchester United were once blocked from signing Luis Suarez due to a transfer ban clause inserted into his contract. The Uruguayan striker spent six seasons at Barcelona, where he won four La Liga titles and the Champions League playing alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar.",
      "But following the 2019/20 season, the ageing superstar was told he was surplus to requirements by manager Ronald Koeman and to look for a new team. The Catalans, however, allegedly backtracked on an agreement to let him leave for free after it emerged he was close to signing for La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Suarez had agreed to give up a percentage of the money owed to him in the final year of his contract and Barca would, in turn, let him leave for free, provided that he didn’t join a handful of clubs.",
      "Real Madrid, Manchester United, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were all on that list, as agreed when he signed from Liverpool for a whopping £75million back in 2014.",
      "The former Reds sensation reached an agreement to join Atletico, only for the Blaugrana to block his move to the Spanish capital too as they didn’t want to strengthen a direct rival.",
      "After threatening legal action and claiming Barcelona should have honoured the agreement to terminate his contract, Suarez finally signed a two-year deal at the Wanda Metropolitano.",
      "He notched two goals and an assist on his debut - an immediate foreshadowing of the huge mistake Barca had made - and went on to score 21 goals in 32 La Liga matches as Diego Simeone’s side won the title. Suarez would score another 13 goals the following campaign before sealing a return to Uruguay with Nacional.",
      "By winning the league in his first season, the now Inter Miami striker, 38, did something he was unable to do in three-and-a-half seasons at Anfield, despite being regarded as one of the best strikers in the world at that time.",
      "From January 2011 to the summer of 2014, the controversial forward managed 82 goals in 133 appearances, including a phenomenal final season where he scored 31 in 33 league matches.",
      "As such, he is one of the few players, along with Fernando Torres, to hold legend status at both Liverpool and Atletico, despite being booed by the Anfield faithful upon his return to face them in the Champions League in November 2021.",
      "The Reds won that group stage clash 2-0 courtesy of goals from the late Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane. And it is unclear which of his former sides Suarez will support on Wednesday evening as they face off at Anfield, four years on from their last encounter.",
      "Ahead of their 2025/26 Champions League opener, the Reds have been in fine form in the Premier League, winning all four of their matches thus far. However, Arne Slot will be frustrated that they’ve had to rely on late goals to win each of those games.",
      "Atletico, meanwhile, have struggled this season, only winning one of their first four La Liga clashes. That came at the weekend with a 2-0 win at home over Villarreal, though Liverpool away will present a far tougher challenge.",

      "The crisis that looks to be unfolding at Manchester United seems to be worsening by the day. After their stunning second-round Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town, United were comfortably beaten 3-0 in the Manchester Derby at the weekend.",
      "This season was supposed to herald a new dawn for United's under-fire manager Ruben Amorim after their 15th-placed finish last season, coupled with their crushing Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Yet despite a host of new signings, Amorim is again under increasing scrutiny. United are currently 14th in the league with just one win in four, which came via a late penalty against newly-promoted Burnley before the international break.",
      "Former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has made a major claim about Amorim's position in the Red Devils' hot seat. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Foster believes Amorim is already in the owner's sights for the sack, and actions are in motion, but nobody at Old Trafford wants to pull the trigger on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Foster said: \"It’s already rumbling. It’s already there. It’s been rumbling for a long time. Nobody just wants to really commit to it. But I guarantee you, if, after eight games, they’ve got eight points and they’re still in 14th or 15th position, somebody’s gonna have to pull the trigger because it can’t carry on like that because it’s been proven now. It’s nearly a year since he’s been the manager. It won’t work.\"",
      "United started the Manchester derby with Altay Bayındir between the sticks, despite signing goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day for £18.2million. Previous No. 1 Andre Onana also left the club on loan for Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "However, ex-United midfielder Scholes maintains that it is a \"criminal offence\" if United were not interested in Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer. City eventually completed the signing of PSG's Champions League-winning keeper for just £27m, with the Italian impressing against United on Sunday.",
      "\"I don't think the quality is there [in the side],\" Scholes told the BBC. \"Goalkeeper was a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise [Andre] Onana is not good enough?",
      "\"If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that is [a] criminal offence. The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"",
      "Speaking of Amorim's now-infamous commitment to his 3-4-3 system, a formation many believe will cost the 40-year-old his job, Scholes insisted United's manager must change his tactics.",
      "\"He cannot carry on playing this way, he just can't,\" Scholes said. \"At some point there has to be a moment where he thinks, 'I have to change something because what I am doing now is not working and I am not getting results.",
      "\"The proof is there. I like Amorim, with everything he says, he seems to be a likeable man. But unfortunately results paint a picture.\" Up next for Amorim and United is a home clash with Chelsea on Saturday, September 20.",

      "Ruben Amorim is said to be \"losing the dressing room\" at Manchester United, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's on his way out of Old Trafford. This comes after Erik ten Hag demonstrated how to extend his tenure with the club despite similar rumours long before he was eventually given the boot.",
      "Following a dismal Premier League finish in 15th place last season, United are currently 14th in the table after Sunday's crushing 3-0 defeat at Manchester City. The Red Devils won't be participating in European competition this season and have already been knocked out of the EFL Cup following an embarrassing loss to League Two side Grimsby.",
      "This has led to rumours Amorim is finding it difficult to maintain the support of his players less than a year into his tenure. However, nearly 11 months passed between Ten Hag being subject to the same rumours and his eventual dismissal in October 2024.",
      "Ten Hag's disagreement with Sancho was well-documented, with the Dutch manager expressing concerns about the winger's training displays early in the 2023/24 season. The former City youth player returned to Borussia Dortmund on loan in January 2024 as United showed signs of improvement.",
      "If it hadn't been for United's FA Cup final victory over City in May 2024, Ten Hag would likely have been given the boot sooner. However, that win bought him some time beyond the 2024 summer transfer window, during which he received further support from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team.",
      "Fast forward to the present day, and there are some uncanny parallels between those days of uncertainty and the current state of affairs at United. Amorim was given the resources to overhaul his squad in his first summer transfer window at the club, while offloading a lot of players considered surplus to requirements.",
      "The notorious 'bomb squad', including the likes of Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony, have all been shipped out, either on loan or permanently. Yet it appears there are still some at Amorim's disposal who are finding it hard to get on board.",
      "United have only managed one win from their last five matches in all competitions this season. Even then, a controversial injury-time penalty was needed to edge past newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford last month.",
      "It was always predicted the team would need time to adjust to Amorim's favoured three-at-the-back system. But with around £250million splashed out on new signings since his arrival, patience is wearing thin as to how much longer it will take before the system starts delivering results.",
      "There's a growing sense of unease within the squad, with some senior players reportedly baffled by Amorim's rigid tactics. These players feel the manager is sticking to a game plan that doesn't suit the team, despite Amorim insisting he'll stick to the methods that brought him success at Sporting CP.",
      "Many are questioning how long the Portuguese will last in Manchester, with the consensus being his days are numbered unless there's a drastic improvement in results soon. However, if United's handling of Ten Hag's situation, despite rumours of him \"losing the dressing room,\" is anything to go by, Amorim might still have plenty of time to turn things around.",

      "Bayindir kept his place in the starting XI for the Manchester Derby on Sunday, but the 3-0 defeat did little to convince Amorim to stick with the Turkey international. Lammens is 23 and has only ever played club football in Belgium, but he has caught the eye of United’s veteran third-choice keeper Tom Heaton.",

      "“Twenty-three years old coming into Manchester United, first few days training and he’s been very impressive so far. I really like his goalkeeping fundamentals.”",

It's a different league, a different country, a different ball,” he said. “So they will fight for the position. We are really pleased [with Lammens]. He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",

      "Those revenues were made during a period in which United finished in 15th place in the Premier League, their worst performance in the competition since it was created in 1992.",
      "Due to their competing in the Europa League, the final of which they lost to Tottenham Hotspur, United saw broadcasting revenues slump by £50m to £173m given their participation in the Champions League the season before.",

      "Sources reiterated Ruben Amorim retains the backing of the board following a bruising defeat to Manchester City, but it's clear Amorim desperately needs results.",
      "Sack the manager, hire a new coach and usher in an exciting new era by spending in the transfer market. That is the nature of football, but United have become specialists in failure when the club has been built on success.",
      "Amorim needed a fast start after overseeing the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years, but United have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years.",
      "The situation is depressingly familiar, and you only have to look back to last season to see a United manager who needed to start the campaign well, failed to do so, and was axed.",
      "It was the wrong decision to keep Erik ten Hag after the FA Cup final triumph. Ten Hag managed to survive the September and October international breaks, United scraped a win against Brentford, drew against Fenerbahce and the Dutchman was finally shown the door after a defeat to West Ham on October 27.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked the day after the loss to the Hammers. The season was still salvageable at that stage, but United did not enjoy a new manager bounce when Amorim was appointed in November.",
      "The October international break is synonymous with managerial sackings. History tells you the next few weeks are crucial for Amorim.",
      "United could beat Chelsea this weekend and enjoy further wins against Brentford and Sunderland before the October break, but Amorim is yet to win successive league games during his tenure.",
      "United's head coach has the unwanted record of having the lowest win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "It's not unthinkable that Amorim could turn the ship around, but the number of fans who doubt he will be a success is increasing, despite the vocal support for the 40-year-old at Old Trafford.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the Burnley win. Banners were unfurled, flags were flown, and one had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction to Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the message. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around\".",
      "The fanbase is split on, just as it was with Ten Hag, although the situation with Amorim is not as grave as it was in the final weeks of Ten Hag's reign.",
      "Having said that, Ineos' decision to sack Ten Hag just nine game into the 2024/25 Premier League campaign shows they are open to the idea of an early change, and United play Chelsea, Brentford, Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking.",
      "The Liverpool fixture at Anfield immediately after the international break already looks ominous. Arne Slot's side are favourites to win the Premier League title and could smell blood when United visit next month.",
      "Four games into the Premier League season, it feels ridiculous that the conversation around Amorim's future has started, but results dictate the narrative and United only have four points.",
      "Just last month, someone who has worked at United for six years said the mood in the camp was \"genuinely different\" this summer. Pre-season was full of positivity, Amorim boosted morale by looking to cut ties with anyone who didn't have a future at the club and there was excitement about what could be achieved.",
      "Everyone is hoping Amorim will overcome the slow start to the new campaign and become a success at Old Trafford. But he is facing an almighty battle to silence the doubters.",

      "If there is a team that can turn the apparent advantage of no European football into a disadvantage it is Manchester United.",
      "Already, the six or seven-day gap between games feel inauspicious. The downbeat mood festers for longer and there is not even a League Cup third round tie to play and fuel confidence that can be channelled into the next weekend fixture.",
      "One of the reasons why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in such immediate peril after United's 5-0 shellacking by Liverpool four years ago was that they did not have a midweek match. United were caught short and had no succession plan, so Solskjaer limped on for another four weeks.",
      "But the club had decided he would have to go and began devising a plan, incurring two more damaging defeats to Manchester City and Watford. In the Sir Elton John Stand at Vicarage Road, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Louis van Gaal only survived United's Boxing Day loss at Stoke - their fourth in a row - due to the tight turnaround. They hosted Chelsea two days later and performed spiritedly in a watchable goalless draw.",
      "The weeks drag in the wake of a defeat. United's next three fixtures are all Saturday kick-offs, so the gaps will be a day longer than the six days between City and Chelsea.",
      "Then it is another international fortnight. United had decided by last year's October internationals that Erik ten Hag would go. It was just a case of when. Inexplicably, they swung the axe three games after the October internationals.",
      "There was a rendition of \"sacked in the morning\" at the Etihad on Sunday. Ten Hag was dismissed on a Monday last year. That gave Ruud van Nistelrooy a full week in caretaker charge. United are not wavering on Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have one win from their opening five games, as they did in their last campaign devoid of European football in 2014-15. United did not maximise their lighter workload that season and scraped fourth place with one win from their final six games.",
      "Their season was salvaged by two six-game winning sequences in the winter and the spring. The latter featured victories against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City that remain among United's best against those sides in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "It was during that sprightly spring that Van Gaal settled on a winning formula. Six days after Arsenal ended United's chances of silverware in the FA Cup quarter-final, Van Gaal paired Chris Smalling with Phil Jones, moved Daley Blind to left back and recalled Juan Mata to the right wing. United were 3-0 up against Spurs at half-time.",
      "United were unchanged a week later at Liverpool, where they produced what remains their best performance at Anfield since the back-to-back 3-1 triumphs in 1997. That same XI started the Manchester derby three weeks later when United battered City 4-2.",
      "Amorim has made six changes across United's four league games. He has only ever picked an unchanged XI once, at Lyon four days after the goalless Old Trafford derby.",
      "Losing to a City side devoid of their fear factor and beaten in their previous two games by tactically astute teams warrants a major rethink. Amorim is never going to compromise on the failing 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to and his stubbornness extends to some selections.",
      "Overpromoting Altay Bayindir to first choice has not worked. Amorim said Bayindir could be like Edwin van der Sar. He is not as good as Raimond van der Gouw and Senne Lammens may as well go in goal sooner rather than later.",
      "Amorim talked his way into trouble by labelling Luke Shaw, who has broken the 40-appearance barrier in three out of 11 seasons, \"world-class\". Shaw has been reinvented as a centre half but remains an auxiliary option and Amorim has reduced Harry Maguire to a goalscoring impact sub.",
      "Managers can be too dogmatic about right-footed and left-footed centre backs and a few of them (Van Gaal, Amorim and Erik ten Hag) have ended up at United. United are better off with Maguire than Shaw. Maguire played on the left of a back three of only the third England team to reach a World Cup semi-final.",
      "For a 24-year-old, Manuel Ugarte is too naive as the designated defensive midfielder. Fulham coach Marco Silva and winger Alex Iwobi admitted they preyed on United's numerical disadvantage in midfield last month as their centre backs \"want to jump\". Ugarte has to take a back seat otherwise Amorim will revert to the less mobile Casemiro.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' redeployment in midfield is anathema to many accustomed to seeing him higher up the pitch yet he excelled from deep in the second half of last season, so much so he scored a hat-trick from there against Real Sociedad. United have a surfeit of No.10s and a paucity of midfield options. Keeping Fernandes further back is better for the team's balance but his defensive shortcomings have to be cut out and can be if Ugarte stays deeper.",
      "The wingers are a growing concern. Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu are inadequate in the final third. Given Amorim's preference for a left-footer on the left wing, Amad is worth a go as he is a superior footballer to the raw Dorgu.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are certain picks as the two playmakers when both are fit. Benjamin Sesko is pleading for time but his time could be up before he knows it unless he starts scoring. He has to consistently start, at least until the October internationals.",
      "The October international fortnight will be scrapped next year. The bad news is the September break will be extended to three weeks.",
      "Woe betide United if they are still out of Europe then.",

      "United have told fans \"academy players and staff would greatly appreciate your support\" but they have decided to significantly raise ticket prices for the academy fixture against Bilbao.",
      "In November, United charged £3 for adults and £1.50 for children to watch the Under-19s against AZ Alkmaar at Old Trafford. That meant the total cost for one adult and one child to attend that game was £4.50, yet the same tickets for the clash with Bilbao will now cost £15 - a 233% increase.",
      "The U21s play their home fixtures in the league at Leigh Sports Village, which is 13 miles away from Old Trafford, and tickets for those fixtures have previously been free of charge.",
      "Ticket prices have been a source of controversy since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in United last year.",
      "United made the mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game in the Premier League, with no concessions for children or pensioners.",
      "Fans organised protests against the price hike and Ratcliffe added fuel to the fire in his interview with the United We Stand magazine, saying that \"it doesn't make sense\" for a United ticket to cost less than a ticket to watch London-club Fulham.",
      "In Ratcliffe's United We Stand interview, he said of the anger at the ticket price rises: \"I understand that. I was brought up on a council estate in Manchester, I absolutely get that.",
      "\"I don't want to end up in a position where the genuine local fans can't afford to come, but I do want to optimise the ticketing. We need to find a balance. And you can't be popular all the time either. Here, we're talking about three per cent of the tickets. That's not the issue.",
      "\"The issue, as you say, is whether this is the thin edge of the wedge. I don't think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.\"",
      "Told that wages are higher in London, Ratcliffe continued: \"I get that. I'm not sure there's an answer that keeps everybody happy, but we need to keep the majority happy.\"",

      "\"If Ruben Amorim played a 4-3-3 formation, he'd get the best out of Bruno Fernandes,\" he told BetWright. \"I don't think the current system suits him at all, which is worrying because Fernandes has been Manchester United's best player for a few seasons now.",
      "\"If he was to walk into a team like Real Madrid or Barcelona, he’d be a star. But he's playing for a United team that is really struggling and probably isn't getting the full credit he deserves.",
      "\"I'm glad Bruno stayed at the club; there was a lot of talk of a move to Saudi in the summer transfer window. I think the fans love him and he’s shown a lot of loyalty by remaining in Manchester.\""

      "English clubs get their Champions League campaigns underway this week - but Manchester United are not one of the six teams represented.",
      "United failed to qualify for any European football this season as they finished 15th in last season's Premier League standings. They almost managed to sneak into the Champions League, but lost a tight Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur and ended the term with disappointment.",
      "Ruben Amorim and everybody associated with the club fully understood the consequences of missing out. It was a major blow to Old Trafford chiefs.",
      "UEFA already dished out lucrative amounts for Champions League participants before they revamped the competition ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Now there are more matches than ever, with the financial incentives on offer increasing even more.",
      "Reports suggest that clubs earn £2m for each win they record in the league phase in 2025/26. With eight fixtures to play, that means a maximum £16m is on offer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Alternatively, the prize money for a draw is set at £600,000, whereas there is no money on offer for a defeat. But there is a guaranteed set starting fee of over £16m awarded to every club who qualifies for the league phase, plus a share of the £740.6m 'value pillar' which includes payments based on TV fees and coefficient rankings.",
      "Arsenal and Tottenham began their league phase campaigns on Tuesday night, beating Athletic Club and Villarreal respectively. That means they're both already off the mark with the cash to come at a later date.",
      "Still to play this week are Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, and Newcastle United, who could follow suit and pocket themselves the prize money for a single win if they are able to beat Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, Napoli, and Barcelona respectively.",
      "It comes as United have released their financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2025 fiscal year, ended 30 June 2025. Old Trafford chiefs have announced record revenues of £666.5m despite having no Champions League football to benefit from.",
      "They are still at an operating loss for the sixth season running, now totalled at £18.4m, although this has fallen from £69.3m in the fiscal year 2024.",
      "Chief executive officer Omar Berrada commented: \"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"We are also investing to upgrade our infrastructure, including completion of the £50m redevelopment of our men’s first team building at Carrington, on time and on budget, following prior investment in our women’s team facilities, to create a world-class environment for our players and staff.",
      "\"Meanwhile, planning continues to meet our ambition of developing a new stadium at Old Trafford as part of a transformational regeneration of the surrounding community.",
      "\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",
      "\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners. As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim needed to start the new season well, but it has not gone as planned for Manchester United.",
      "United responded to their shock defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup by securing a win against Burnley before the international break, but a hammering against Manchester City soon followed next.",
      "Phil Foden opened the scoring in the 18th minute of the Manchester derby at the Etihad last weekend and Erling Haaland scored twice in the second half to seal a comfortable 3-0 victory.",
      "The second inquest of the season has started at Old Trafford. The pressure on Amorim increased after Grimsby and the derby defeat has cranked up the noise around his future.",
      "United have made their worst start to a season since 1992/93, when they also had four points from their four matches under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Amorim has the unwanted record of having the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "So, what's next for Amorim? We've had a look at how he should respond to the City defeat.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best player and Amorim is not getting the best out of him. Fernandes has made a poor start to the campaign and failed to track Phil Foden's run for the opening goal last weekend.",
      "Last month, Fernandes made the same mistake against Fulham at Craven Cottage when he didn't track Emile Smith Rowe, which shows he is struggling with the role's defensive aspects.",
      "The evidence from the opening few weeks of the season suggests Fernandes should be relocated further up the pitch.",
      "That means Fernandes would have to rotate with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the No.10 roles and minutes would have to be shared, but playing him in the pivot isn't working.",
      "Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Fernandes to start in midfield.",
      "In the final days of the summer transfer window, Mainoo requested to leave on loan for the sake of regular starts, but Amorim insisted that the youngster would stay and fight for his place.",
      "Fans have questioned why such a talented young player felt a change of scenery was necessary. Amorim has argued Mainoo is not the finished article, but the midfield is an issue and Mainoo could be a solution.",
      "It's time to play Mainoo and give him a consistent run of games in the midfield pivot. He started for England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final and has too much talent to be limited to substitute appearances.",
      "Mainoo thrived playing alongside Casemiro in his breakout season and that would be a logical partnership for the three games against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the international break.",
      "Altay Bayindir and Luke Shaw should lose their starting roles on the back of the derby defeat. Bayindir was not to blame for the loss, by any means, but he was shaky from the first whistle and should have done better for Erling Haaland's first goal, as he went to the ground too easily.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted screaming at Bayindir after City's third goal, trying to encourage his goalkeeper to keep his head up, and the Turkey international's confidence looks shattered.",
      "Senne Lammens is an unknown quantity, despite having a strong reputation in Belgium, but the bar is low to impress. Lammens needs to start against Chelsea, and another defensive change is required.",
      "Shaw had his worst game for United since his return from injury. The 30-year-old has started each Premier League game on the left of the back-three, but Harry Maguire should now replace him in the team.",
      "Amorim hasn't helped himself by picking players in the wrong positions, while his tendency to tweak the starting team each week has made it difficult for United to build momentum.",
      "Having a settled team might improve their chances of success, so Amorim should stick with the same starting XI for each game up until the October international break.",
      "This XI makes sense: Lammens, Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Mainoo, Mbeumo, Sesko, Fernandes.",
      "That line-up is dependent on Diogo Dalot returning from injury against Chelsea.",
      "It's ridiculous that United have entered must-win territory just four league games into the season, but if Chelsea win at Old Trafford, the talk around Amorim's future will intensify.",
      "United should target at least six points from Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland. The October international break will be an opportunity to assess Amorim and positive results are required to safeguard his future.",
      "The Reds found a way to win against Burnley before the September international break. That was key after Grimsby and it's just as important to bounce back against Chelsea.",

      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has come under fire for his performance for Olympique Marseille in their 2-1 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. The former United player set up the opening goal of the game, reacting quickest to rob the ball in a dangerous area, teeing up Timothy Weah to put Marseille a goal to the good after just 22 minutes.",
      "Xabi Alonso's side would equalise from the penalty spot just six minutes later through Kylian Mbappe, before another spot kick in the 81st minute from the French forward ensured Madrid would get off to a winning start.",
      "Speaking on RMC, as relayed by Le10Sport, journalist Daniel Riolo claims some players were far from their best, name-dropping Greenwood post-match.",
      "Riolo said: \"Greenwood, I wonder if he's not made like that. Strong against the weak and weak against the strong, there's a bit of that.",
      "\"A little intermittent, you don't know if he's really connected to the collective. What does he do in the collective? I don't know, it's weird.\"",
      "Sports.fr also touch on former French international Johan Micoud's disappointment in Greenwood, relaying: \"Mason Greenwood's performance Tuesday night in the Champions League match against Real Marseille disappointed Johan Micoud. For their return to the Champions League after a two-year absence, Olympique de Marseille were beaten by the narrowest of margins Tuesday night at Real Madrid (2-1).",
      "\"In addition to the controversy surrounding refereeing decisions, some Marseille players disappointed observers, particularly in the attacking line.",
      "\"Starting alongside Timothy Weah to support Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mason Greenwood was able to shine throughout the match, notably in Marseille's goal and the ball offered to Weah for the opening goal (22nd minute).",

      "\"I can't see how this manager is avoiding the sack,\" a Manchester United season-ticket holder who was in the away end at the Etihad messaged. \"He’s had a free pass until now and it was always the case that he had to start the season well. He certainly hasn’t.\"",
      "Another was in the lower tier and remained until the end. \"Personally, I think he's finished,\" he admitted. \"Loads of reds want him to do well but there's nothing at all to say he's the man.\"",
      "\"He's getting hammered in the pub,\" another said. He was not referring to Ruben Amorim drowning his sorrows.",
      "\"Amorim is like a pigeon,\" another messaged, \"endlessly crashing into a glass window, dazed and stubborn, convinced he’ll break through if he just keeps at it.\"",
      "This is not the United matchgoers outright turning against Amorim. They are just resigned to another in-season managerial change.",
      "Amorim fronts up in defeat by strolling onto the pitch to applaud the supporters. There were only a handful remaining in the three tiers of the Etihad's South Stand at full-time on Sunday.",
      "City scoring at least three times, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland on the scoresheet, an emptying away end and an empty feeling. We have become accustomed to this watching United in derbies over the past 12 years. Amorim copped similar treatment to David Moyes, Jose Mourinho, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.",
      "And even if Amorim survives long enough to brave the red flares outside Anfield next month, Liverpool have form for immediately, or eventually, seeing off a United manager.",
      "Moyes was sacked 37 days after a 3-0 defeat. Van Gaal was sacked 74 days after a 2-0 defeat. Mourinho was sacked two days after a 3-1 defeat. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked 28 days after a 5-0 drubbing. Ten Hag was sacked 57 days after a 3-0 defeat.",
      "One sensed at Grimsby that Amorim had gone past the point of no return. That it was in the League Cup and on penalties barely tempered the nuclear fallout from that humiliation. Some players who started that night are unlikely to ever play for United again.",
      "The summer recruitment already appears dubious. United have the ingredients for an appetising filling but their sandwich crumbles with a flaky base and top.",
      "It is on Amorim that he promoted Altay Bayindir to first choice. In 15 appearances for United, Bayindir has conceded 26 goals.",
      "Senne Lammens is inexperienced, such an unknown quantity he was at United's original feeder club, and was not one of the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month. He is due a chance sooner rather than later for the sake of variety.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had his most accomplished outing for United at City yet fired blanks again. It is seven goalless games for club and country this season. Rasmus Hojlund, typically, has found the back of the net for club and country since he fled the United maelstrom.",
      "Luke Shaw's stint as an auxiliary centre back may be over. Amorim, like Ten Hag, favours a left-footer on the left of central defence. The more sensible strategy would be to pick an actual centre back.",
      "Entrusting Shaw in the Europa League final backfired and it was a matter of time until it did so again this season. Harry Maguire is a specialist centre half and a better defender than Shaw but has been reduced to an impact substitute capable of increasing United's lowly goal threat.",
      "United's script on their weakened midfield has already come back to haunt them. Club sources claimed the area was never their priority in the transfer window given the \"strong and versatile options available\".",
      "Casemiro's only memorable performances this calendar year were restricted to the Europa League and United are not in Europe. Kobbie Mainoo has not started a league game since May, with Manuel Ugarte recalled ahead of him in the derby despite his first-half horror show at Grimsby.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are not specialists. Mount has got injured in the second league fixture in each of his three seasons with United and then been sidelined for at least three weeks.",
      "Three opponents have scored against United through runs from deep. Fernandes was at the scene of the crime again for Phil Foden's 18th-minute header.",
      "Amorim clutched at straws. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" he said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",
      "\"Against Arsenal, do you think we play well?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think we are the better team?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno. Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated that United would only stop playing in the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to if they change manager. If he suddenly switched to a back four, United would not necessarily look much better.",
      "Lammens in goal, Noussair Mazraoui at right back, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt at centre half and Patrick Dorgu at left back, with Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as the No.10 with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha either side and Benjamin Sesko up front does not scream Champions League qualifying contenders.",
      "And as enterprising as United were against Arsenal, they lost without scoring to a team that did not perform and protected a 13th-minute goal gifted to them.",
      "That does not grant the manager a free pass.",

The Manchester United loanee's in-swinging cross was met by former Leeds forward Raphinha, who made it 2-0 just after half-time.",
      "Rashford wasn't able to get on the scoresheet himself, but doubles from Fermin Lopez, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski gave Barcelona a confidence-boosting win to prepare them for Thursday's trip to the North East.",

      "There had been optimism that 18-year-old Yamal would be fit for the Newcastle game, but it's ultimately come too soon for the Euros winner. On Wednesday, ahead of flying to Newcastle, Barcelona published their 22-man squad list and Yamal was conspicuous by his absence.",
      "It hints that Rashford has a strong chance of starting at St James' Park on his return to England, with Hansi Flick's other option to replace Yamal - summer signing Roony Bardghji - having been brought off at half-time against Valencia.",
      "Raphinha will likely play on the opposite flank, with either Ferran Torres or Lewandowski as the striker. Rashford, who was not part of Ruben Amorim's plans for United moving forward, has a respectable nine goals and assists in 15 games against Newcastle.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was among the Manchester United players past and present to throw their support behind Jadon Sancho after the winger made his debut for Aston Villa.",
      "The winger has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, failing to find his footing in the Premier League despite thriving in Germany. As a result, Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, where he scored five goals and 10 assists across all competitions.",
      "While the Blues had a £25million obligation to buy the 25-year-old as a result of finishing fourth in the league, the Stamford Bridge side ultimately opted to pay a £5m penalty to send him back to the north west. With Sancho not a part of Ruben Amorim's plans for 2025/26, Sancho was once again sent out on loan for the season, this time to Villa.",
      "The England international marked his full debut for his new club in a 1-1 stalemate with Brentford in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday evening as Villa were knocked out after a tense penalty shootout. While it wasn't the result Sancho will have hoped for from his first game, he took to social media to celebrate kick-starting the next chapter of his career.",
      "Sharing a selection of snaps from the game in an update shared to Instagram, Sancho wrote: \"Happy to make my debut for @avfcofficial, not the result we wanted but something to build on.\"",
      "A number of Sancho's United team-mates were quick to show their support for the 25-year-old. Among the names who liked the post were United club captain Fernandes, as well as Marcus Rashford - who is currently enjoying a loan spell of his own with Barcelona after falling out of favour with Amorim.",
      "Elsewhere, youngsters Ethan Wheatley, who is on loan at Northampton Town, and Joe Hugill, who is enjoying his own loan stint with Barnet, showed their support. A number of Sancho's former team-mates in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jesse Lingard and Tosin Adarabioyo were also among those who liked the post.",
      "Meanwhile, Villa defender Ian Maatsen left a couple of love heart emojis in the comments section. Sancho's loan deal comes as he enters his final 12 months of contract with United, although the club have the option to extend his deal by a year to prevent him leaving on a free next summer.",
      "Sancho isn't the only player who has been shipped out by United this summer after being omitted from Amorim's plans going forward. Rashford spent the latter half of last season on loan with Villa before returning to his parent club this summer.",
      "He is now representing Barcelona on a season-long deal, with the La Liga giants also holding a £20m option to take him on permanently. Elsewhere, United have successfully offloaded Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea in a £40m deal.",
      "The Argentine has failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford in 2020 as a youth prospect, with the 21-year-old reportedly falling out with Amorim at the training ground this summer. As a result, he's now settling in to life at Stamford Bridge, making his debut in a 2-2 draw with Brentford at the weekend.",
      "He could also feature in Chelsea's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich on Wednesday evening as Enzo Maresca looks to balance European and domestic workloads. Also departing United this summer was Antony, who joined Real Betis on a permanent contract after impressing with the Spanish side on loan last term.",
      "Antony managed nine goals and five assists for Betis during his loan spell, and Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping for more of the same this season, after snapping the Brazilian up for an initial £19m plus add-ons.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Amie is a football writer covering clubs across the country, she has been a football fan all of her life and supports Leicester City. She graduated with a degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology in 2015. Amie has previous experience in local radio in Leicester and Leicestershire.",
      "It has been a disappointing start to the Premier League season for Manchester United.",
      "One win, one draw, and two losses in their first four games of the season have left them in 14th place in the table, with four points from a possible 12 available. A 3-0 loss against rivals Manchester City on Sunday afternoon was one to forget for United fans.",
      "It has also raised questions again about Ruben Amorim's future. The summer transfer window saw the club spend around £200 million on new players, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The first games of the campaign have, however, shown the problems that remain in the squad. With the summer transfer window now closed, work will have to be done in January to address those issues.",
      "Amid growing pressure on his position, Amorim may already be looking to the work he can do when the window reopens if he is still at the club. Addressing problems in the winter window could relieve some of the pressure on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Here’s a look at what a dream January window could look like for Amorim and United.",
      "There’s no doubt that midfield reinforcements should be the priority for United going into the January window. The club did make moves for players in the summer.",
      "Brighton’s strong not-for-sale stance on Carlos Baleba caused them to walk away from any potential deal. But United could potentially try again in January in the hope that the Seagulls may be more open to a sale.",
      "If that’s the case, then negotiations could start, with an agreement between all parties hopefully being reached. The arrival of Baleba could potentially help give Bruno Fernandes more freedom, even if he is playing in a deeper midfield role.",
      "Another player linked with United in the last few days is Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson. The player caught the eye with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia in the international break.",
      "The former Newcastle man has shown how he can control games and dictate the play, something that United have been missing so far this season. However, like with Baleba, a deal may not be easy to do with Forest, who will be keen to keep hold of a key player, especially during the first transfer window with Ange Postecoglou at the helm.",
      "Away from midfield, one other area where United probably need more cover is at right-back. Currently, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the two recognised right-backs in the squad.",
      "An injury or suspension to just one will leave United short on options. United have again been linked with an interest in Inter’s Denzel Dumfries.",
      "The full-back has recently admitted that he would be open to a Premier League move, and would add experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United did complete the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two deeper midfielders in the January window, then it would allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on loan for the second half of the season. The midfielder outlined his desire to leave on a temporary deal during the summer, but United refused.",
      "If the club can add to their midfield options, then it would free up the academy graduate to go out and get regular game time.",
      "Another player who could go out on loan is Tyler Fredricson. Lisandro Martinez is expected to be back from injury in the next couple of months, if the centre-back can get up to speed quickly then it would provide enough defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to go out and get more games.",
      "Chido Obi could be a third candidate to go out on loan. After making his United debut last season, the striker is yet to make a matchday squad this season, and has been back playing for the U21 squad.",
      "A loan deal could see him get more of a taste for first-team football in the second half of the season, and hopefully return a better player.",
      "One player who could leave permanently is Tyrell Malacia. The full-back was linked with a move away in the summer, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton",

      "United lost 3-0 to Manchester City in the Manchester derby on Sunday and Amorim became the target of criticism from pundits. The Portuguese has now only won won eight of his 31 league games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Despite being highly regarded in his native Portugal for his outstanding work at Sporting Clube de Portugal - ending their 19-year league title drought and leading them back into Europe - the last few months in England have not been easy for him.",
      "Outsiders are keeping an eye on his situation and reports in Portugal claim he is being considered as a potential manager for Benfica.",
      "Next month, the Portuguese giants will hold elections for a new president. Candidate Joao Noronha Lopes, together with former Benfica and Portugal international Nuno Gomes, who is running as vice-president, are reportedly considering Amorim as a potential coach.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The pair were in attendance at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and, upon their return to Lisbon, were quizzed about the latest rumours.",
      "Noronha Lopes explained: \"We went to Manchester to watch the derby, and when we are together, we take the time to have meetings and prepare the future of Benfica.",
      "\"We didn't meet up with Bernardo Silva or Ruben Amorim after the game. I want to bring to Benfica a winning culture, which has talent, dedication and people who know how to win.\"",
      "When quizzed if he would like to see Amorim as manager of Benfica in the near future, Noronha Lopes added: \"Ruben is under contract with Manchester United and I won't comment on that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gomes denied that their trip to Manchester had anything to do with the United manager. \"I don't want to speak about that, I'm a friend of Ruben Amorim, and he has a contract with Manchester United,\" he added.",
      "\"We watched the game, Joao [Noronha Lopes] is a passionate football fan and I enjoyed this experience with him.\"",
      "It wasn’t the first time he had been asked about Amorim. Last weekend, he stated: \"I can't answer that question at the moment but I'm sure that Amorim will be the manager of Benfica, one day.\"",

      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "A striking recall yet Ugarte was United's best player in the first half and operated at a level that was the polar opposite of his 45 minutes at Grimsby. Unable to halt City's second-half charge. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Guilty of failing to track the runner for another goal that United conceded three weeks after Emile Smith Rowe evaded him at Fulham. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Could have intercepted the switch of play which eventually led to Foden's goal. Had chances to service Sesko but his crossing was abject. 4",

      "United travelled to the United States to compete in the Premier League Summer Series this summer, preparing for the new season with friendlies against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim included a handful of youngsters from the academy in the travelling tour squad. Williams made the cut and scored his first senior goal in a 4-1 win against Bournemouth.",
      "In August, Williams signed for Falkirk on a season-long loan. The forward made 17 appearances during his six-month loan with Cheltenham Town last term and will now try to develop his game in Scotland.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Record, Williams said: “I played about 15 minutes against Bournemouth in Chicago in the summer. We won 4-1 and I scored. The whole team was really warming to me and the other young players. To play and score on tour was life-changing. Something I will never forget.",
      "“Coming off the back of that, getting the opportunity to play here in a good league against good teams is really important to me. I just can’t wait to get my foot in the door and start pushing for starts.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Falkirk, he said: “I’d been speaking to the manager (John McGlynn) and his coaches for quite some time over the summer. Going on tour with United it was quite difficult, communication wise. But once it was set in motion I was ready to come here. I’m happy to be here.",
      "“It’s always good to know that a manager trusts you. For him to come to me and be interested is quite flattering. I’m proud to be here.",
      "“The team has had back-to-back promotions and want to play aggressive football against the top teams. It’s a style I like as a winger. That’s what sold it on me.",
      "“The Scottish Premiership is a very good league, comparable with leagues in England. My first experience of it was good. It was a really proud moment and I’m thankful the manager trusts me and gave me minutes.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as United's Under-18 manager in the summer, but his previous role involved keeping tabs on academy prospects and reporting on their progress.",
      "Williams discussed his relationship with Fletcher, adding: \"I’ve been a United fan for a long time. Him being in the team with the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney, they were the glory days of Man United.",
      "“It’s quite an unreal experience when you step back and think ‘wow’ I’m actually talking with Darren Fletcher. It’s a mad experience for a young kid. But being up here and around it is a good thing.",
      "“Darren was one of the first team assistant coaches, he’s with the U18s now but I’m in contact with him. He knows the game and is a big part of Manchester United. He’s someone that is looking to help me in my journey.",
      "“He’s been asking how everything’s going. I told him I’ve settled well and the team is really welcoming. Everyone is really heartwarming with me and getting around the lads has been a good experience.\"",
      "Williams' professional contract with United started in June 2024 and he was given the chance to train with FC-Lausanne's first team in October as part of an innovative agreement between the Swiss club and United.",
      "Williams joined United's academy from Rochdale at Under-14 level. He is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making more than 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",

      "Manchester United have announced ‘record revenue for the fiscal year of 2025’, so it turns out that they won’t be going “bust” this “Christmas”.",
      "The Red Devils have had a torrid year on the pitch, with Ruben Amorim’s side enduring an embarrassing season in 2024/25, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy.",
      "They are currently on track for a similar finish in 2025/26 amid no real sign of progress under Amorim, who has only guided his side to one win in five matches this season.",
      "Man Utd have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup at the earliest opportunity, with their season without European football likely to be followed by another as they languish in the bottom half of the Premier League and put all their eggs in the FA Cup.",
      "Still, the on-field turmoil at Man Utd has had no impact on the finances, with the club reporting ‘record revenue’ in 2025.",
      "READ: Man Utd suffer ‘more embarrassment’ as Amorim ‘impacted’ and ‘cash windfall’ imminent",
      "United have managed to earn record revenues of £666.5m, and while they lost £18.4m, this is down from £69.3m in 2024.",
      "The Premier League giants have also set records relating to matchday revenues (up 17%) and commercial revenues (up 10%), following the hiking of ticket prices and a lucrative partnership with Snapdragon.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada has commented on these findings, claiming they are on track to “support” their “overriding priority”.",
      "“We are working hard to improve the club in all areas. On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term,” Berrada said.",
      "“Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "“As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.”",
      "These findings also make a mockery of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s claims that the Red Devils were at risk of going “bust by Christmas” if he did not make substantial cuts to spending, with the club always going to manage as long as the on-pitch results have such little influence on their income.",
      "Speaking in March, he said: “Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year – by the end of 2025 – after having me put $300m (£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer.",
      "“We are in the process of change and it’s an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans.",
      "“The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don’t do those things.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has put OGC Nice up ‘for sale’ and has already settled on an asking price.",
      "Hiring Ruben Amorim and refusing to accept his resignation are among 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes in his 18 months at Manchester United.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "According to reports, Sir Jim Ratcliffe prevented Manchester United from making a ‘proposal’ for a shock re-signing in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Manchester United are back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ‘masterminded’ a big spend, ‘rebuilt’ everything and even won the Alejandro Garnacho transfer situation."

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have a clear stance on whether to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford permanently next year.",
      "In the summer window, Rashford secured a dream move to join Barcelona as the Spanish giants settled on a loan with a buy option deal with Man Utd.",
      "Barcelona were tempted to sign Rashford after he returned to form during his impressive loan spell at Aston Villa, in which he grabbed four goals and six assists in all competitions.",
      "Raphinha and Lamine Yamal sparkled for Barcelona last season, but Barcelona’s priority in this summer’s window was to sign a new attacker to provide competition for places.",
      "Hansi Flick’s side eventually settled on Rashford as their preferred target after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the England international’s versatility mooted as a key factor behind the decision to sign him.",
      "READ: Man Utd suffer ‘more embarrassment’ as Amorim ‘impacted’ and ‘cash windfall’ imminent",
      "However, the 27-year-old has endured a slow start at Barcelona as he has only registered one goal involvement in his first four appearances.",
      "This has fuelled speculation that he could return to Man Utd in 2026, though a new report in Spain claims he is part of their plans moving forward.",
      "It is suggested that Barcelona already have a ‘priority 2026 plan’ regarding signings as they want a winger, a centre-back and a ‘galactico’.",
      "The report claims Rashford currently stands out as an obvious option for the wing and they would be willing to ‘pay’ to sign him on one condition.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The second focus is on the wing. The club reserves the option of signing Marcus Rashford permanently if his loan agreement goes through this season. The Englishman is popular for his power, dribbling, and versatility, and if he maintains a high-level season, Barça will seriously consider paying the 30 million euro option. This would ensure an attacking trident with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha as their strike partners.’",
      "Elsewhere, it is noted that Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland are their main options to be their next ‘galactico’, though the Man City superstar is their ‘ultimate dream’ signing.",
      "Regarding Barcelona’s interest in these players, the report adds:",
      "‘Haaland is the ultimate dream: he would be the signing that would define an era at Camp Nou. However, his signing is presented as a highly difficult transaction due to competition from other European giants and the financial implications. Meanwhile, the option of Julián Álvarez appears to be a more realistic option: young, versatile, and with elite experience, he could fit perfectly into Flick’s model.’",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed whether he’d rather have Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe with the Manchester City star “blitzing” teams like he did Manchester United.",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has become an ‘obsession’ for Barcelona president Joan Laporta as he looks to bring in a new forward, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, with Viktor Gyokeres trying valiantly to keep pace with Erling Haaland.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Both players looked unhappily unsure of themselves for long spells last season, but both were smiling again in their 3-0 win over Manchester United"

      "This has angered Nice supporters and it has now emerged that Ratcliffe is looking to cut ties with the French side.",
      "A report from French outlet Ici claims INEOS are ‘expected to speak out in the coming days to clarify its position’ and ‘set the course for the future.’",
      "It is noted that a clear update is due ‘imminently’, with the Nice ‘project quickly buried after the Manchester United takeover, which relegated the club far down his list of priorities’.",

      "The return of European football this week means the phony war phase of the 25/26 season is over and real test now begins with a diet of two games a week the order of the day for all the big clubs apart from Manchester United between now and the Busy Festive Period.",
      "Squad depth inevitably becomes a key factor over these next few months, so let’s take the opportunity to rank the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ based on their preparedness for the task.",
      "Obviously Manchester United don’t really belong here, but it’s still fun to look at their second XI anyway, isn’t it? Shut up, it is. And let us tell you this: it’s just as well they haven’t got two games a week.",
      "There are, inevitably, fudges here. There is not really such a thing as ‘first XI’ and ‘second XI’ in the modern squad game. So just try and remember that it’s all a bit of fun, yeah? A distraction from the bad things that happen.",
      "Among the biggest fudges we’ve made are those around injured players. On the one hand it felt daft to include, say, James Maddison even in a hypothetical Tottenham team. But at the same time it seemed silly to deny ourselves Noni Madueke in Arsenal’s back-up XI just because Bukayo Saka is out for a few weeks.",
      "The rough rule of thumb is that injured players expected to be back before 2026 are included; those not expected to be seen until next year are not.",
      "",
      "Marco Bizot; Andres Garcia, Pau Torres, Victor Lindelof, Ian Maatsen; Boubacar Kamara, Ross Barkley; Emi Buendia, Harvey Elliott, Donyell Malan; Evann Guessand",
      "Starts off well enough, but quickly disintegrates in front of your eyes. It’s a stark reminder of just how hard teams like Villa have it in trying to compete with the country’s elite in terms of squad depth and composition.",
      "And while we do think it’s past time they stopped whingeing about PSR and got on with it, it’s still easy enough to share or at least understand their frustration. The Thursday-Sunday workload for a team that have already made an alarmingly poor Premier League start could be killer looking at this lack of squad depth. We’ve had to include more injured players than would ideally have been the case as well, although that does at least mean we all avoid the indignity of Lindelof in midfield. Every cloud.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale; Emil Krafth, Malik Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall; Jacob Ramsey, Joe Willock, Lewis Miley; Harvey Barnes, William Osula, Anthony Elanga",
      "It’s not the worst defence around, and by going with the back four Newcastle have predominantly used we do get to have Sven Botman as a high-class back-up because it’s impossible on this season’s current numbers to leave out either Dan Burn or Fabian Schar.",
      "The midfield looks a touch flimsy, and goals may well be the problem for this team. We also retain the right to change this team about a bit once we know how exactly Newcastle plan to deploy Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, but our current best guess is that both are in that first-choice XI, which does at least give this underpowered Newcastle team a couple of useful wide players.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens; Tyler Fredricson, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven; Diogo Dalot, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo, Tyrell Malacia; Mason Mount, Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee",
      "It’s not just the first XI being screwed up by Ruben Amorim’s absolute insistence on his precious back three. In the real world, of course, one imagines he’d sooner actually deploy Casemiro back there than go with two rookies flanking poor old Harry Maguire, but it only shifts the problem elsewhere with Lisandro Martinez out of contention for the foreseeable.",
      "Diogo Dalot being in the second XI feels like a quirk given he nearly always plays when available, but it does always feel like that’s because he’s actually first reserve in about six different positions rather than first choice anywhere.",
      "READ: Is this the team that takes Man Utd back into Europe? With or without Amorim…",
      "",
      "Filip Jorgensen; Malo Gusto, Wesley Fofana, Benoit Badiashile, Jorrel Hato; Romeo Lavia, Andrey Santos; Estevao, Facundo Buonanotte, Jamie Gittens; Liam Delap",
      "Can argue around the fringes of a few of these, especially Gittens v Garnacho, but it’s a solid enough team. As it ought to be for the BlueCo Player Trading Facility. It’s going to feel very odd when Liam Delap is fit again and Chelsea have two actual strikers to choose from.",
      "What does quickly become clear with a lot of these second XIs is that the defence is very often the primary cause of concern, and that’s definitely the case here. Doesn’t help when even your first-choice keeper is no confidence-inspirer, mind.",
      "",
      "Antonin Kinsky; Archie Gray, Kevin Danso, Ben Davies, Destiny Udogie; Lucas Bergvall, Yves Bissouma; Brennan Johnson, Wilson Odobert, Randal Kolo Muani; Dominic Solanke",
      "Spurs’ lack of defensive numbers are writ large here in a squad where Djed Spence has now surely usurped Destiny Udogie as first-choice left-back but also remains first understudy to Pedro Porro on the opposite flank. That means poor old Archie Gray gets shoehorned into this fictitious team just as he was shoehorned into so many actual Spurs teams last season.",
      "Ben Davies as a first reserve in big 2025 is a hilarious situation, and Spurs fans will just have to keep everything crossed that Frankball continues to place far less stress on Micky van de Ven’s twangy hamstrings than Angeball did.",
      "Further forward… it’s not too bad, although Xavi Simons’ status as the only real lock-picker in the long-term absence of both Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison leaves a front four where perspiration would appear to significantly outdo inspiration.",
      "We’ve had to go for a 4-2-3-1 here rather than Frank’s preferred 4-3-3 just on a numbers game; and even then we’ve had to include the apparently discarded Yves Bissouma, who was not named in Spurs’ Champions League squad.",

      "Giorgi Mamardashvili; Jeremie Frimpong, Joe Gomez, Giovanni Leoni, Andrew Robertson; Wataru Endo, Stefan Bajcetic; Federico Chiesa, Curtis Jones, Rio Nguhoma; Hugo Ekitike",
      "Arne Slot attempting to solve his Trent Alexander-Arnold problem by playing Dominik Szoboszlai as his first-choice right-back gives us a strong start to this XI, with Liverpool having once again secured themselves A+ goalkeeping back-up after Caoimhin Kelleher’s years of top service.",
      "That hole left at centre-back by the failure to get Marc Guehi over the line really is a large one, though. Really does feel like Liverpool are one halfway serious injury away from a crisis in there.",
      "",
      "James Trafford; Matheus Nunes, Nathan Ake, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis; Nico Gonzalez, Nico O’Reilly, Mateo Kovacic; Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush",
      "It’s an XI that wouldn’t feel entirely absurd to see in action, and you can’t really ask for much more than that. Rico Lewis shuttled over to left-back is a bit of a positional fudge and there’s no denying it’s a midfield three that tends toward the dreary.",
      "If you want an XI with more creative oomph, then Oscar Bobb could come in for O’Reilly and turn it into more of a 4-2-3-1, we guess. But the front three is good fun regardless. So it balances out. Kind of.",
      "",
      "Kepa Arrizabalaga; Ben White, Piero Hincapie, Cristhian Mosquera, Myles Lewis-Skelly; Christian Norgaard, Mikel Merino; Noni Madueke, Ethan Nwaneri, Gabriel Martinelli; Kai Havertz",
      "Come on, now. That’s just daft, isn’t it? That’s just… just a completely fine top-six Premier League starting XI. There is not one conspicuous point of weakness, no fudge where a player is shoehorned into a secondary role to fill a gap and do a job.",
      "Not one player you’d have any concerns about fulfilling the exact role they’re occupying here in any game.",
      "We’d be genuinely interested to see where this hypothetical team might finish for Arsenal across a whole Premier League season, and there really would only need to be the slightest distorting of reality to arrive at our preferred banter answer of second.",

      "It has been a bewildering decade or so for goalkeepers caught in a Pep-prompted identity crisis. But Guardiola may finally have brought some relief for keepers at all levels still confused as to who and what they really are.",
      "It was already brewing around 2016, but the public’s perception of goalkeepers really became skewed when Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad and immediately binned Joe Hart. At that point, Hart was still England no.1 and widely regarded as one of Europe’s top goalkeepers.",
      "A playmaker, though, he was not. So out he went for Claudio Bravo. The Chilean took the form of a hologram when his goal was being targeted, but he could spray passes for fun.",
      "Guardiola found the necessary balance at Benfica. From there he bought Ederson in 2017, since when coaches across the land have sought to imitate the City boss by turning their keepers into quarter-backs.",
      "It was entirely reasonable to demand more from goalkeepers in possession. But by that point, no No.1 had ever reached the top level without a solid grounding in the basics. Pep came a quarter of a century after the back-pass ban in 1992 which was genuinely seismic for goalkeepers in comparison to what the Guardiola movement demanded.",
      "Still, keepers have endured a disorienting time in recent years. At all levels, they have so often been judged more on their feet than their hands. Which ignores the primary purpose of a goalkeeper entirely.",
      "Maybe for many it was a matter of convenience. Judging a goalkeeper is very difficult – coaching one even more so – when you have no knowledge of the position. Why learn about the role when you can change it to something else closer to what you’re already familiar with?",
      "Mercifully, the man who prompted a million p*ss-poor imitations may be redressing the balance himself. For goalkeepers particularly, Guardiola’s signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma could be as influential as the slinging of Joe Hart.",
      "There should be some caution over reading too much into Donnarumma’s arrival since it was clearly an opportunistic move on City’s part. Even up to the first weekend of the season, Ederson was staying and he would compete with James Trafford. The chance to sign one of the world’s best goalkeepers was, evidently, too good to miss. Though not if you’re Manchester United.",
      "But it does give an insight into Guardiola’s instinct and the way he sees the game going.",
      "“He is so tall, he is so huge. From all the keepers, what we want is safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence.”",
      "In goalkeeping terms, those are almost old-school traits. But as necessary now as they ever were with so many teams at the top level opting to take a more direct route, with long throw-ins and set-pieces slung under the bar back in vogue.",
      "The Goalkeepers’ Union is yet to elect its first spokesperson – who would that be? – but reports from the ground suggest the feeling in the ranks is one of relief. Where Guardiola goes, others inevitably follow, so perhaps the obsession with goalkeepers being playmakers might diminish to a more reasonable balance.",
      "That’s a positive thing for everyone, right? Who among us wants to watch a formulaic, overly-prescriptive game where goalkeepers and centre-backs spend much, much more time on the ball than the attacking players? Supporters don’t show up for rondos in their own box while the flair players stand high and wide on the off-chance a centre-back can beat a rabid press. Do they?",
      "That absolutely isn’t to dismiss entirely the idea of building from the back. The principle is sound – especially if you are Guardiola with City’s players to put it into practise. But somewhere along the line, it became the only way to play.",
      "That saturation point, thankfully, seems to have passed. Managers at all levels, from the Premier League down through the EFL to the park, if not ditching the theory completely are choosing their moments far more wisely. Many are again embracing the direct route. To the point that the cycle perhaps might again take us on Route One to POMO football.",
      "We don’t want those methods across the board in the same way that building from the back should not be forced on absolutely everyone; football needs different styles, rather than being the homogeneous lump it threatened to become while everyone jumped aboard Pep’s bandwagon.",
      "From a goalkeeper’s perspective, there remains some way to go before the world has properly healed. After all, when Donnarumma became available in the summer, there was a queue of just one, rather than the clamour there ought to have been to land one of the greats in his prime. His wages, of course, were a factor, but too many still overlooked his shot-stopping genius because he’s not passing like Pirlo.",
      "Guardiola can see past that, so it should not be long before everyone else has their priorities straight too.",
      "It’s a rollercoaster of emotions for Manchester United fans today with ‘music to their ears’ here and ‘more embarrassment’ there.",
      "Graham Potter has been nothing short of a disaster as West Ham manager; who will drink from the poisoned chalice next?",

      "Ahead of this game, a report from The Mirror claims Amorim has been given ‘three games to save his job’, with upcoming matches against Chelsea, Brentford and Chelsea said to be pivotal.",
      "‘Despite privately insisting they still have faith in Amorim, United’s football leadership team gave the same assurances to Erik ten Hag, before pulling the plug on him nine league games into last season.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United would have to pay an ‘eye-watering’ sack bill if they part ways with head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim is currently the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked as Man Utd have endured a poor start to the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd have only won one of their opening five games across all competitions as the Premier League giants are still struggling to get used to the head coach’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Amorim’s unwillingness to adapt is hindering Man Utd as they remain ineffective in attacking areas, while they are also too easy to play through and score past.",

      "READ: Amorim sack inevitable but he has proved that replacing him at Man Utd might be impossible to fail",
      "Now, The Daily Mail are reporting that the Red Devils face paying an ‘eye-watering’ bill, with ‘£12million’ to be paid to Amorim ‘if they sack the Portuguese coach within the first year of his contract at Old Trafford’.",
      "It is also pointed out that ‘although the Portuguese boss said in May that he would walk away without compensation if United decide he is no longer the right man, that is unlikely to be the case’.",
      "It is noted that ‘four favourites’ to replace Amorim are ‘Marco Silva of Fulham, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Aston Villa’s Unai Emery and Andoni Iraola of Bournemouth’, though Man Utd are ‘refusing to panic’ and ‘believe the stats show an improvement this season’.",
      "Despite this, it appears that Man Utd’s squad are not sold on Amorim, with a new ‘alarming issue’ being that a ‘number of figures close to the first-team squad are increasingly concerned that he hides when the going gets tough in matches, and does not do enough to inspire from the technical area’.",
      "There are also said to be two more ‘concerns’ as Man Utd’s squad have ‘doubts over Amorim’s system and concerns over his motivational ability are lingering’.",
      "Meanwhile, there is also the feeling that Amorim’s ’emotions can get the best of him’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Interesting to see Amorim take questions from only four reporters after the Manchester derby defeat before he was taken out of the firing line by club staff.",

      "It’s the second time this season that the Norwegian has bagged twice in a club game, first doing it on the opening day of the season against Wolves.",

      "Sorry for the molten hot take – you may wish to sit down for this, SPOILER ALERT etc. – but it does rather look like Manchester United might have to change their manager again some time quite soon.",
      "We absolutely count ourselves among the mugs who thought Ruben Amorim would be different. That this was a manager who arrived in Manchester with the requisite skills and charisma to actually have a chance.",
      "He charmed us early on, albeit that was mainly by behaving with impressive dignity when Ed Sheeran was being a prick on Sky and every single member of Sky’s starry-eyed pundit panel simperingly indulged it after a 1-1 draw at Portman Road. A result which, in hindsight, might actually have been the more significant event of the day.",
      "But he’s f**ked now, his insistence on sticking with his beloved 3-4-3 in the face of a squad wholly unsuited to its requirements having long since tipped over from stoic and principled into mulish stubborn stupidity.",
      "His attempts at goading Manchester United into sacking him are now free from any and all couching, with his response to another humbling result in which his system and the players attempting to play within it were ruthlessly exposed yet again being “I’m not changing, if you want literally anything other than more of this unwatchable and dreadful sh*t then sack me, yeah?” (We’re paraphrasing, but this was the gist.)",
      "Where were we? Oh yeah. Amorim. Back at the start. When we thought he was going to be good at this and, perhaps even more importantly, he thought he was going to be good at this.",
      "Point being, we get it. We get the lure and the pull of Manchester United. In hindsight, Amorim was a damn fool who has set his career back catastrophically by doing what he knew at the time to be a sub-optimal choice of jumping to United mid-season when he had a really, really good thing going on at Sporting.",
      "But you really do always have to remember this was and is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. It’s easy to forget now he’s been reduced to a meme for p*ssing about with his little magnet toys while his team were 2-0 down at League Two Grimsby, but back when United appointed him there was perhaps no more highly-rated and better regarded young coach in the game. Xabi Alonso, maybe, but that’s about it.",
      "Amorim was doing wonders at Sporting and whatever path he chose next seemed absolutely certain to involve one of the biggest clubs in the world. It was almost impossible to conceive a scenario where he wouldn’t be making that step up to the truly elite level with his next move.",
      "And yet even he, when the chance to take over at Manchester United came along at entirely the wrong time didn’t think he could risk turning that opportunity down in case it never came around again.",
      "So you really do have to consider that, when wondering whether managers of less overtly ridiculous Premier League clubs would accept the poisoned Old Trafford chalice if offered it. Because in almost all cases, we really think they would.",
      "The current top 10 favourites with the bookies to be next United manager contains four current Premier League managers. All of them have done and are doing excellent jobs at their current clubs, and all of those clubs are less screwed up than United are.",
      "But still we think any one of Oliver Glasner, or Unai Emery, or Marco Silva, or Andoni Iraola would take this stupid opportunity if it were offered them.",
      "TIMUFCWTA is such a powerful thing, still. To be absolutely clear, we’re not saying any or all of those managers should leave their current jobs for United. With the possible exception of Emery, who may well be sensing the way the Villa Park winds are blowing and consider now to be a good time to get out with his reputation still sky high, it would almost certainly be foolish.",
      "But we still think they’d do it, and can still see why they would do it even if they shouldn’t. Being the manager who sorts Manchester United out is a beguiling thought, and even the most publicly self-effacing manager wouldn’t have got to the level of ‘Successful Premier League Gaffer’ without a large enough slice of ego to truly believe they could be the manager to do just that.",
      "Will it work for them? No, it never does. These people delude themselves into thinking it might but… but it might work for Glasner/Emery/Silva/Iraola.",
      "Hear us out. Are Manchester United a sensible and stable football club for a manager to be getting involved in right now? No, obviously not. Logically you should run for the hills at the first whispers in the press suggesting you’re in the running.",
      "But you have to accept and acknowledge the temptation. We’ve already seen it this summer with players. The power of TIMUFCWTA led Bryan Mbeumo to ignore glances from actual Champions League clubs – one of them now managed by the man under which he reached the elite levels necessary to attract their interest – because he only wanted United.",
      "He’s not an outlier. And nor would any of those managers be who think they could do what Amorim couldn’t, what Ten Hag couldn’t, what Mourinho, Solskjaer, Van Gaal and Moyes couldn’t.",
      "And a big part of the reason why that is somehow a less mad thing to believe of yourself is specifically because of not despite just how bad Amorim has been.",

      "Fair to say we probably all thought United had reached that point under Ten Hag – at least in the league.",
      "Amorim has exploded that notion entirely. Yet now that bar is so low that literally the only way for a new manager to fall below it would be literal, actual relegation. Amorim has so spectacularly scorched the earth that the impossible job might now in fact have become one in which it really is impossible to fail.",
      "United is a mess of a club, without doubt, and the squad is an incoherent hotch-potch of players assembled without an apparent clear plan for how to assemble them into a team. But they shouldn’t be this bad. They shouldn’t be 31-points-from-31-games-and-no-idea-how-to-score-goals bad.",
      "There is still heaps of talent in this squad, and some of it hasn’t been forced out by Amorim yet. There is still time.",
      "So bad has Amorim’s system become that there are quick fixes everywhere. Just changing to a system – literally any system – where Bruno Fernandes can operate as a creative No. 10 instead of a frustrated central-midfield workhorse would surely deliver some kind of instant result.",
      "Having a gameplan where the primary creative outlet is Bruno, or Matheus Cunha, or Mbeumo rather than Patrick Dorgu is surely going to make things a bit less bad. Or a system that doesn’t fundamentally require two mobile, technical runners in midfield when you have no mobile technical midfield runners available.",
      "A defence that doesn’t disapparate instantly at the sight of more than two opposition attackers. This kind of thing.",
      "None of these feel like they should be impossible puzzles to solve. The problem for United currently isn’t that Amorim can’t find solutions to these issues, it’s that he’s too pig-headed to even accept the premise that solutions can or should be sought.",
      "It’s still plenty early enough in the season for any of those other managers to make meaningful changes even with the existing playing personnel at what would in all likelihood be the biggest club any of them would ever get to manage.",
      "It should still be easy enough for a manager with a smidgeon of flexibility and imagination to steer this club into the top eight this season.",

      "There has been a lot of chatter about Amorim’s system and whether it can work in the PL. Whilst xG has little tangible value, the fact we sit second in terms of xG does at least show the system works in terms of creating high-quality chances. Tons of frustration and, ultimately, pressure coming from the fact we can’t seem to finish those chances yet but they are there.",
      "Defensively, we have conceded too many. Some of that is down to the attack not taking pressure off the defence – it’s easier to defend a 2 or 3 nil lead than a 1 goal lead. However, looking at the goals we have conceded this is generally not a systemic issue.",
      "– 1 against Arsenal was a foul or GK error depending on your POV (definite foul). We outplayed Arsenal and should have won the game.",
      "– 1 against Fulham, not closing down the cross and poor marking in the middle. Should have been out of sight by HT, including a missed penalty.",
      "– 2 against Burnley, first was just like Fulham goal and cross should have been shut down, second was long throw, pinball and weak GK. Had enough chances to score 427 goals first half.",
      "– City game, lazy defending by Shaw, Yoro wrong side of man for second, Shaw and Maguire poor on ball for third. Well in the game in the first half, missed two 4 yard tap-ins second half and Donnarumma save from Mbeumo. Ended on similar xG but they were clinical in attack and defence.",
      "So a litany of bad luck, bad finishing, bad defending and valid excuses, but the main thing that counts is the scoreline and points. Naturally, he has to start winning football matches or it’s all for nothing. But focusing on the system is a red herring – even the extra man in MF can be mitigated by players on the pitch (times when a WB comes inside, one of the 10s drops deeper, one of the CBs steps in etc – players need to be better at figuring stuff out on the hop).",

      "1) Ownership with a backbone\nI 100% believe that I am seeing something from the new ownership group that we’ve needed since Sir Alex retired; conviction. You can feel free to listen to Luke Shaw or Gary Neville or other fans who have varying opinions on the situation; what you are seeing cannot be easily fixed with a change of manager and formation; we’ve seen this script play out 5 times now; we’ll hang around 3-6th place for a season or two and the whole thing will implode again.",
      "I am bored of the cycle, we need to hurt at this moment in time. This is a sporting institution that has been mishandled for far too long; having an owner who will take their licks in service to a larger vision is important at this moment. They have their lofty target of our first Premier League by 2028 and I’m willing to see how that will play out. They achieve it, lauded as geniuses and if they fail, the level of anger remains the same.",
      "2) 31 points in 31 games\nWhat is the metric we are holding this up to? I won’t be the “win it all” United of 2009 and we certainly can’t be holding it up to the shit show that was November – May of last season. Contextually, it was horrendous up down, left and right and this is our manager’s first summer to clear out the squad; which he has for the most part and we know that we’ll be clearing a glut of players next summer too.",
      "The replacements have been significantly better than what was there before and so a bedding in period should be expected. Do I think we’ll get relegated? No, seen enough so far to say we are a mid table team that can beat other mid-lower table teams and get a couple of results from those above us.",
      "The way I see the current situation, Amorim is part of the chemotherapy regimen to ‘heal’ United’s cancer (sorry for the crude metaphor, have lost a loved one to it and for others who have to, you catch my drift). The decisions he makes on the field can offer us temporary relief, but it doesn’t guarantee that we’re in remission. What will the signs be that we’re on the right track? Lord, if I knew, I’d be a very rich man.",
      "3) Discomfort in the unknown\nWe live in a society that demands answers without even understanding what questions we should be asking. We, as fans, have been left scrambling looking for solutions so that we can be seen as the reasonable voice in the crowd. Here is my summary as the most reasonableness person in this fanbase; it’s a bit shit at the moment isn’t it? Not being able to will our club into greatness again.",
      "I will always love United; you’ll never be able to take those memories away from me and I’m so happy we live in an age where we can go back and rewatch those moments. But I’m also someone who knows that what it will take to get United back to the top cannot be written out in a one pager.

      "United bosses have hailed their five-year shirt sponsorship with Snapdragon as the most valuable of its kind in world sport, and that played a significant role in boosting revenues with four years remaining on that deal.",
      "United posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m while achieving record matchday revenues of £160.3m.",
      "Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw a raft of cost-cutting measures.",
      "The accounts show total operating expenses were £733.6m, a decrease of £34.9m, or 4.5%, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m, to £313.2m.",
      "This was achieved by several high-earning players, who were not part of the first-team plans, going out on loan or being sold, and wider club restructuring. More than 250 members of staff at Old Trafford were made redundant in the first round of cuts.",
      "The club said they spent £36.6m in terms of exceptional items, which included pay-offs to employees as part of their \"transformation plan\" along with former boss Erik ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The results released on Wednesday showed broadcasting revenue for the 12 months ending June 30, 2025 decreased by £48.9m to £172.9m after the men's team played in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.",
      "More cost-cutting and difficult decisions are expected as INEOS completes its restructuring of the football club.",
      "Ratcliffe warned United would have gone \"bust at Christmas\" if they had not taken \"really tough decisions\" - something chief executive Omar Berrada believes will help moving forwards.",
      "\"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" he said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.",
      "\"Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",
      "\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners.",
      "\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",
      "United are expecting the next financial year to bring in revenue of £640m to £660m despite being without European football for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "\"The Manchester United bosses will be pleased with these figures, which they will feel show real progress towards cutting costs and growing revenues. But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",
      "\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",
      "\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.",
      "\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.",
      "\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.",
      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",

      "By Gary Cotterill",
      "Wednesday 17 September 2025 11:21, UK",
      "Jose Mourinho is in talks over a return to Benfica as their new head coach.",
      "The 62-year-old was sacked last month by Fenerbahce after just over a year in charge at the Turkish club, but could be set for a swift return to management at the club he was briefly in charge of between September and December 2000.",
      "The Portuguese is in negotiations to replace ex-Wolves boss Bruno Lage at Benfica after he was sacked following Tuesday's shock Champions League home defeat to Qarabag of Azerbaijan.",
      "It was Benfica's first loss of the season after they blew a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to Qarabag.",
      "Benfica president Rui Costa confirmed Lage had been dismissed in a press conference following the loss.",
      "\"I believe this is the time for a change, precisely to avoid compromising the season,\" Costa said.",
      "\"And, consequently, the coach who comes in must be a winning coach. A coach representing a club of this size must be one with the ability to bring this team to the levels we demand and give us the titles we desire.\"",
      "Benfica reached the league phase of the Champions League after knocking out Mourinho's Fenerbahce in the play-off round, which led to his dismissal at the Turkish giants.",
      "The ex-Manchester United and Tottenham boss could now head back to the Lisbon club, although nothing is confirmed yet.",
      "If a deal is completed, Mourinho would face his former club Chelsea later this month, with Benfica visiting Stamford Bridge on September 30 in the Champions League.",
      "Mourinho first came to prominence at Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, winning the UEFA Cup in 2003 and the Champions League in 2004.",
      "He joined Chelsea soon after that Champions League success and steered the Blues to Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, plus the 2015 crown in his second stint in charge.",
      "He was a Champions League winner at Inter Milan in 2010 and, while he was unable to restore Man Utd to greatness, he did guide them to Europa League and League Cup success in 2017.",
      "His time at Tottenham ended without a trophy, though he was sacked days before the team were due to take on Manchester City in the 2021 League Cup final.",
      "He was a Conference League winner at Roma in 2022 before taking charge at Fenerbahce in the summer of 2024.",
      "\"I'm being urged to be a little bit cautious as, although talks have taken place, it's not a done deal yet, but certainly talks are taking place between Benfica and Jose Mourinho's representatives to return to the club he left 25 years ago, which was his first job in management.",
      "\"It didn't last too long, there were presidential elections. The new president who came in wanted to bring in somebody else back then. That's a little bit behind the thinking this time because there are presidential elections due again at Benfica, with the new president already putting out the name of Jose Mourinho.",
      "\"It's come full circle for Mourinho in terms of his 25 years of managerial history, and it's become full circle in the last month because Mourinho was sacked by Fenerbahce after he criticised the board for not bringing in the players he wanted ahead of their Champions League play-off defeat to Benfica over two legs, which they lost narrowly 1-0.",
      "\"That meant Fenerbahce went into the Europa League and not the Champions League. Now it seems that Mourinho may after all be in the Champions League with the team that knocked him out of the Champions League, this season.",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 10:14, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "Between the Lines returns with a look at his approach, a breakdown of how formations have evolved in the Premier League, and an examination of the system's issues at Manchester United.",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."

      "Ruben Amorim forced to defend system once again as he refuses to deviate from favoured formation; Man United lost 3-0 to Man City in the derby, as Amorim's side suffer worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim said he accepts \"any decision\" taken in the wake of Manchester United's latest punishing defeat, this time in the Manchester derby, as his record at the club took another significant hit.",
      "United's four points from as many games this season means the club have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, while Amorim himself now has the unenviable record of the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "To make matters worse, and illustrate the situation most starkly, since Amorim was appointed last November, United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" he said after a 3-0 defeat to Man City. \"In the important moments, they were better than us.",
      "\"I'm trying to be rational. I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.\"",
      "When asked what message he might have for angered fans, many of whom left well before the final whistle at the Etihad, he said: \"My message? I will do everything. Always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"Until I'm here, I'll do my best. The rest is not my decision. I'm suffering more [than the fans].\"",
      "Much of the criticism levelled at Amorim involves the rigidity of his 3-4-2-1 system, and his vow never to deviate from a framework that, so far, has served his players poorly.",
      "Both balance and consistency are proving tough to come by, but the Portuguese was resolute in defence of his style once again after the derby defeat.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"And we talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that in the system or whatever. So I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change it.",
      "\"I understand how football is and the results dictate the narrative. I see it that way. I know that is hard for people. The fans do not want to hear these things. I don't lie to myself. I see the record and I accept any decision.\"",
      "\"I think there will be some pressure applied to the manager and his rigidity of sticking with the system,\" said Neville about the ramifications of the loss to City.",
      "\"City have beaten them well and comfortably. United had some good moments in the game - the first 15 minutes and the first five minutes of the second half. City, in big moments, have had better players. Foden, Doku, Haaland have stood out.",
      "\"There have been times when I have seen United lose this type of match when I feel angry and frustrated.",
      "\"I just feel nothing, which is even worse. This has been a nothing of a performance. United have just been beaten.",
      "\"With Chelsea next week, another defeat and big questions would start to be asked.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
