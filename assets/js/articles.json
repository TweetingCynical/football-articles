      "Manchester United face a pivotal campaign this season - and planning is already well underway. A number of Red Devils return to Carrington on Monday for their first day of pre-season.",
      "And it’s probably fair to say that Ruben Amorim will have his stars hard at work as he attempts to recover from what was a woeful season last time out. Fortunately, work has already started on their summer business.",
      "A £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha has already been rubber-stamped - with the Brazilian joining from Wolves - while Diego Leon became United’s second addition of the summer. But the work is not expected to end there.",
      "A new winger, as well as a striker, are also on the club’s shopping list. But will those deals get done in time?",
      "There’s less than two weeks before United’s first pre-season friendly of the summer against Leeds so Amorim will be keen to get moving. Take a look at the most pressing issues that the Portuguese coach needs to sort:",
      "The Brentford star has emerged as the Red Devils’ prime target of the summer - and all the signs point towards the deal being done. United have faced competition from Premier League rivals Tottenham but Mbeumo is currently prioritising a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "They have had two bids for Mbeumo rejected and are now contemplating a third which will be in the region of £65m. And should all go to plan, United will be optimistic of getting a deal done sooner rather than later.",
      "A deal for Mbeumo will take United’s spending this summer to around £130m, meaning they will likely need sales to offset that outlay. And there are already a number of candidates to leave.",
      "Last season’s loanees Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are all high on the list of potential departures. So Amorim will be very hopeful of finding suitors for all of the three.",
      "The exits are unlikely to stop there though. Goalkeeper Andre Onana is a candidate to leave on loan, while left-back Tyrell Malacia is unlikely to have a future at the club following a season with PSV.",
      "Finally, Alejandro Garnacho could also be sold amid apparent interest from Chelsea and Napoli. Amorim will surely want the future of his misfits decided before they fly away for their pre-season tour, but that could well be a tough task.",
      "Speaking of departures, Onana is one of a host of players who could leave. The Cameroonian goalkeeper has endured a tricky few seasons since joining for big money from Inter Milan.",
      "Reports have suggested that United are open to letting him leave on loan amid apparent interest from Monaco. And that has seen the club linked with a host of goalkeepers including Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Botafogo star John Victor.",
      "Amorim must come to a decision over his number one sooner rather than later. If he decides to let Onana go, a replacement needs to be signed but if he stays, Amorim needs to make it clear that he is his man going forward.",
      "And while Amorim has a decision to make between the sticks, the same could be said of the centre of his attack. Cunha and Mbeumo represent excellent additions to United’s frontline but they are unlikely to be leading the line this coming season.",
      "A central striker has long been on the club’s shopping list. Viktor Gyokeres was a strong candidate for a move but he now appears likely to become an Arsenal player instead.",
      "It could potentially leave United in a tricky position where they don’t have enough funds for a new striker, which may have to see Amorim put his faith in Rasmus Hojlund. But that decision needs to be made first.",
      "The past few seasons have obviously been rotten for United but there is one place that they have excelled - giving academy stars an opportunity. Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer are two of the standout success stories over recent seasons.",
      "But with a lack of European football next season, the best way for the club’s young stars to get experience might be loan spells away. Dan Gore, Harry Amass and Ethan Wheatley are candidates for temporary moves, while there are also plenty of promising stars in the club’s academy ranks who could benefit from moves.",
      "Amorim needs to work with newly-appointed head of loans Jonny Evans to decide who could potentially be sent out on loans over the coming weeks.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "All three players were part of the Portugal squad who won the Nations League in July, beating Spain on penalties in the final. The United duo were scheduled to return to Manchester this week as the Red Devils begin pre-season training.",
      "But Fernandes and Dalot will be allowed to return later than the rest of United's first-team quad. The Sun report that the pair have both been granted a week's compassionate leave.",
      "A source adds that both players are 'heartbroken' and explains that United's squad have 'rallied around them'. Red Devils captain Fernandes and right-back Dalot each shared tributes on social media following Jota's death.",
      "\"Friend, colleague and companion in a thousand battles,\" Fernandes posted. \"It is difficult to understand how it is possible for someone to leave so soon.",

      "Amad also said: \"My sincere condolences to Jota's Family and his Wife. We are all devastated by this news. May their souls rest in peace.\" Joshua Zirkzee added: \"Unbelievable news... rest in perfect paradise, prayers to your loved ones.\"",
      "United begin their pre-season campaign against Leeds in Sweden on Saturday, July 19. Ruben Amorim's team then play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton on tour in the United States. Their fifth and final match is at home to Fiorentina on Saturday, August 9."

      "Manchester United's quest to improve Ruben Amorim's squad goes on with little over a month until the Premier League returns. And the Portuguese coach will soon have his squad in pre-season training ahead of a tour to the United States.",
      "The summer transfer window got off to a quick start with the arrival of Matheus Cunha, but the Red Devils have not been able to build on that momentum. Only the arrival of teenager star Diego Leon has been confirmed since with plenty of work to be done.",
      "United have failed to trim their squad thus far too. Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof departed at the end of their contracts, while Jonny Evans moved to a coaching role but Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all remain at Old Trafford.",
      "But the club still hope to strengthen in their forward positions despite being unable to secure an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo thus far. An out-and-out striker may not go amiss for Amorim too.",
      "Manchester United are ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective solution for Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are in the process of rebuilding their squad the Portuguese coach is said to believe that Calvert-Lewin would be a useful addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Despite a poor injury record, reports claim that United believe the forward has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. United are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses tied into appearances as they eye a handy squad player.",
      "Calvert-Lewin left Everton after nine years at the end of June and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016.",
      "Any hope Manchester United had of landing Viktor Gyokeres appears to be over as Arsenal close in on deal for the Sweden striker. The Gunners are advancing in talks with Sporting Lisbon as the Portuguese side granted the striker additional time off as they seek to resolve his future.",
      "Andrea Berta had been progressing deals for Gyokeres and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the former now appears to have won out as Arsenal move closer to finally signing a striker.",
      "The two clubs have yet to agree on a fee but it is understood Arsenal and Gyokeres have already agreed personal terms. And with the player prioritising a move to Arsenal, having rejected other suitors, it now looks likely that a deal will be completed.",
      "Juventus are preparing to make an offer to Manchester United for Jadon Sancho. The Serie A side are said to have already held talks with the winger, who is reportedly open to life in Italy.",

      "Dan Ashworth's tenure as Manchester United's sporting director was a short-lived one, ending in disaster within just a few months. Ashworth was a prime target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who had to patiently wait over four months for him to officially commence his role due to being placed on gardening leave by his previous club, Newcastle United.",
      "It was on the 1st of July last year that Ashworth formally joined the Red Devils and immediately embarked on an ambitious recruitment campaign for then-manager Erik ten Hag, following United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "One of those other players was well-acquainted with Ten Hag, who was eager to reunite with. United shelled out £42m to bring former Ajax ace Matthijs De Ligt in from Bayern Munich.",
      "In a bid to provide Rasmus Hojlund with some assistance at the opposite end of the pitch, Ashworth activated Joshua Zirkzee's £34m buyout clause from Bologna after the Dutchman had aided the club in securing Champions League football for the first time in nearly six decades.",
      "Eager to bolster their defensive midfield – with Casemiro failing to replicate his Real Madrid form at the time – United sanctioned a move for Manuel Ugarte, who Paris Saint-Germain were willing to offload after just one season.",
      "A £40m offer was enough to secure the former Sporting CP star's services, eventually reuniting him with Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese boss' appointment as Ten Hag's successor last November.",
      "However, Ashworth departed United in December, before he could witness the outcome of his efforts. Over four months of the season had already elapsed upon Ashworth's exit and the performances of those three players left much to be desired.",
      "Despite De Ligt earning a formidable reputation in Europe since his teen years, he initially struggled to find his footing in Manchester's defence. While United endured a lacklustre season under Amorim, the Dutchman gradually found his rhythm in defence, sparking hopes among United fans that he will remain a key figure in their backline for years to come.",
      "The same optimism doesn't extend to Zirkzee, whose underwhelming presence has led United to continue their search for a striker to address their goalscoring issues – a role the former Bayern Munich forward was expected to fulfil.",
      "The 24-year-old has only managed to net seven goals in 49 matches across all competitions, with a mere three coming from Premier League games.",
      "His future at the club could be up in the air if Amorim succeeds in attracting ex-Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, despite Arsenal showing strong interest. Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also on United's current watchlist.",
      "As for Ugarte, the 24-year-old excels in tackling and regaining possession, typical traits of a defensive midfielder. However, he faced criticism last season due to his lack of forward play, with supporters arguing that his passing skills and athleticism are severely lacking.",
      "Amorim faces a colossal task ahead of the 2025/26 season, and it's yet to be seen what role these three players will have in United's future.",
      "And it seems unlikely that Ashworth's full quartet will be completed anytime soon. Branthwaite has recently signed a new contract with Everton under ex-United manager David Moyes.",
      "The England international, now reportedly valued at around £70m, inked a new five-year deal earlier this week.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective addition to Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are rebuilding their squad in the summer transfer window and Amorim believes that Calvert-Lewin would be a good addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived at United for £62.5million from Wolves and the club are still chasing Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who will also cost north of £60m. But with the club conscious of profit and sustainability rules, they are also on the lookout for cheaper signings.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has left Everton after nine years and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016 and is seeking a fresh start.",
      "He has struggled with injuries in recent years, but The Sun reports that United believe he has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. They are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses for appearances so he could become a useful squad player in a role which could help avoid further injuries.",
      "United are still trying to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who all spent last season away on loan, as well as Alejandro Garnacho and, potentially, Rasmus Hojlund. With Cunha a No.10 and Mbeumo best off the right wing, Calvert-Lewin could slot into the forward line as a No.9.",
      "He managed just three goals in 26 Premier League games last season with injury sidelining him between January and May. But he is hungry for a new challenge after posting an emotional farewell to Everton upon the expiry of his contract on June 30.",
      "He wrote: \"To Everton Football Club and the Evertonians. After nine remarkable years at this club, I've made the incredibly difficult decision, together with my family, to begin a new chapter in my career.",
      "\"This isn't something I chose lightly. Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It's the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow, and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.",
      "\"Whether times were good or tough, your unwavering support never faltered. Celebrating goals at Goodison Park, feeling that roar, is an experience I'll carry with me forever. This choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together.",
      "\"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton. I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club.\"",

      "The Red Devils sold Elanga for £15m in 2023 and the Sweden international has thrived since. The Forest winger featured in all 38 Premier League games in 2024/25 and scored six goals and providing 11 assists as the club qualified for the Conference League.",
      "United are reported to hold a clause that entitles them to 15 per cent of any profit Forest make on Elanga. That would see Ruben Amorim's side rake in around £6m if their Premier League rivals do earn a £55m fee.",
      "Personal terms are unlikely to be an issue between player and club, per the Mail. Though Newcastle may yet find rivals for Elanga's signature, with Aston Villa also said to be monitoring the situation.",

      "On that occasion, the Tyneside team were willing to pay £45m fee which included an initial £30m payment, a swap deal for Miguel Almiron and two potential further £5m payments. Newcastle could find more success this summer however, and a greater fee for United.",
      "“ There is a lot of talk,\" Elanga said while on international duty last month, per Sport Witness. \"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",
      "“I guess there will always be scouts wherever I play,\" he added. \"As long as I stay focused and do my best in the match.",

      "Mbeumo is keen on a move to Manchester United this summer, but Brentford have already rejected two bids for the forward. United's last bid was worth an initial £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons and Brentford are said to want more than the £62.5m the Red Devils paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"He had a fantastic season,\" Brentford's director of football Phil Giles recently said when asked about Mbeumo's future. \"We expected big interest in him; we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly demanding £25m for Jadon Sancho this summer, with the winger expected to complete a permanent exit after spending last season on loan at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues paid a £5m penalty fee to avoid signing Sancho permanently after he produced just eight goal contributions in 31 appearances in the Premier League. According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are ready to offer Sancho a fresh start.",
      "And the report states that United want around £25m to sell the forward, who is said to be keen on a move to Italy.",
      "Newcastle have made an improved £55m bid for former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga, according to the Mail.",
      "Elanga joined Nottingham Forest from United in 2023 and the report claims that the Red Devils will be owed around £15 per cent of the profits made if the winger is sold. Should Forest accept Newcastle's bid, United will receive £6m.",
      "Elanga enjoyed an impressive campaign last season, producing 17 goal contributions in 38 Premier League appearances for Forest as they finished seventh and qualified for Europe for the first time in almost 30 years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Marcus Rashford has made contact with Barcelona, after their £58million deal to sign Nico Williams collapsed in spectacular fashion. Williams, 22, was in talks to join Barca but their well-documented financial issues meant that they were unable to guarantee the Spanish winger that they could register him with La Liga.",
      "After weeks of fraught negotiations, Williams decided to instead sign a new 10-YEAR contract with Athletic Bilbao. That's left Barcelona looking for alternatives to strengthen their attacking department.",
      "Liverpool star Luis Diaz is their first-choice target, although the Reds are reluctant to sell the Colombian forward. Bayern Munich recently made an approach for Diaz, 28, which was firmly rebuffed by Liverpool who insist he's going nowhere.",
      "As such there is a gap to be filled at Barca, who have reportedly identified Rashford as their Plan B - with Rashford dreaming of joining the La Liga giants. He wants to test himself in another country rather than staying in the Premier League and Barca are his No.1 choice.",
      "However, with United demanding a fee of £40m, any deal with Barca for Rashford would likely be a loan - unless they can negotiate a drop in United's price tag.",
      "Rashford has told the Spanish champions that he'd be willing to take a pay cut on his £325,000-a-week salary. His brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, was spotted meeting Barcelona sporting director Deco in May.",
      "United say that Rashford has informed the club that he wants to explore a move away, as have Red Devils team-mates Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. Matheus Cunha has also taken Rashford's No.10 shirt.",
      "Last month, the 27-year-old revealed that he wants to play alongside Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in a thinly-veiled come-get-me plea. \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" Rashford told Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Now the chances of him getting his dream move to Catalunya have increased. Athletic announced that Williams had signed a mammoth contract extension until 2035 on Friday morning.",
      "\"When it comes to making decisions, for me, the most important thing is to listen to your heart. I am where I want to be, with my people, this is my home,\" the Spain international commented.",
      "Bayern were also interested in signing Williams, whose release clause has reportedly risen to around £87m.",
      "\"The step forward Nico Williams has taken with this renewal fills the entire Athletic Club family with pride and paints a picture of a future as ambitious as it is exciting,\" the club added.",
      "\"This latest display of loyalty marks a milestone in the history of the club and confirms a path of trust in the sporting project. He will continue to wear the number 10 inherited from Iker Muniain, with the Champions League as his new stage. His step forward in the face of dizzying offers is a resounding success for Athletic Club.\""

      "Marcus Rashford has seen his No.10 shirt at Manchester United handed to Matheus Cunha - in another sign that there will be no return for the England striker at Old Trafford.",
      "Indeed, Rashford is one of five players who want to leave the club and, having informed the club of their desire to do so, will be allowed to report for duty later in July, rather than reporting back at Carrington next week for pre-season testing.",
      "The other four are Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. All will be allowed to report for pre-season back at Carrington late as they seek to finalise moves away, having told the club they are keen to move on.",
      "The club have confirmed that their medical and rehabilitation facilities will remain available to the players, should they want it. Remote support will also continue as it has during the off-season.",
      "Sources also insist that if the players cannot get themselves fixed up with moves elsewhere, then they WILL be welcomed back ahead of the new season - although it will then be down to head coach Ruben Amorim to decide what to do with them.",
      "Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, loses his No.10 shirt at the club as he continues to push for a move away. He is keen to try his luck in another country, with Barcelona his preferred destination.",
      "That move has appeared unlikely for much of the summer, with Barca prioritising a move for Spain winger Nico Williams. But amid worries over the Blaugrana's ability to register Williams if they paid his release clause to Athletic Bilbao, amid the club's financial issues, the player has duly signed a new long-term deal with Athletic until 2035, confirming that he won't be moving this summer.",
      "That offers an opening to Rashford, either on a permanent deal or on loan, particularly with Liverpool insisting that another Barca target, Luis Diaz, is going nowhere this summer.",
      "Sancho is looking to join Juventus after seeing Chelsea pay £5m to get out of spending £25m to sign him permanently after his loan spell, while Garnacho, who had been an important piece of Amorim's side for much of last term, is seeking an exit after falling out with the Portuguese. Frustrated at only being a substitute in the Europa League Final loss to Spurs, his post-match comments were the last straw and he was told by the United boss he can leave.",
      "Malacia has been out on loan at PSV Eindhoven, who decided not to make his loan move permanent for £8.3m, and has no future at the club after an injury hit spell, while Antony was a major hit on loan at Real Betis, who are eager to sign him permanently if they can negotiate an affordable price.",
      "Another option is sending him back to Seville on a season-long loan deal, with an obligation to buy next summer, with United looking to recoup around £30m on the Brazilian.",

Betis are prepared to be patient to come to another loan agreement, per AS, and the club are more than hopeful of coming to a deal should no 'high-flying' offers arrive.",
      "The Red Devils want to sell the Brazil international after he was unable to break into Ruben Amorim's plans following the Portuguese coach's arrival. Betis are interested in a deal after Antony became a key player in taking the team to the Conference League final.",
      "The ex-Ajax star will need to be prepared to take a pay-cut to secure the move after feeling at home in Spain working under Manuel Pellegrini. But a deal may have to wait until nearer the end of the window as United try to secure a fee for a permanent move.",
      "Antony scored nine goals and produced five assists in 26 appearances for Betis after joining the club. A transfer has seen little progress thus far, despite a willingness on all sides to see an Old Trafford exit.",
      "Speaking this week, Real Betis president Angel Haro spoke to Cope Sevilla, per Sport Witness, and suggested the move was outside of their control. Haro stressed Antony’s return depends 'on Manchester United, Antony and on Betis being willing to pay the transfer fee”.",
      "“He’s a fantastic player; he’s given us a lot in the last six months, but we have to get everything right; we can’t go crazy. We’re working on that path because it’s not easy,\" said Haro.",

      "Betis are expected to raise some funds through Johnny Cardoso's move to Atlietco Madrid this summer. The Spanish side could bring in £26m to aid any offer for Antony.",
      "Antony is among a number of United players the club are attempting to facilitate permanent exits for. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are all yet to find a new club despite the 13-times Premier League champions deciding they want to part ways.",
      "Sancho is said to be in talks over a possible move to Juventus after Chelsea paid a £5million fee in order to cancel turning the star's loan into a permanent deal. Rashford meanwhile could have renewed hope of a move to Barcelona after their target, Nico Williams, extended his stay at Athletic Bilbao."

      "Former Manchester United star Gabriel Heinze once was regarded as a legend in the making at the club. Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

      "33-year-old Casemiro would be the most likely of those options after moving into the final year of his contract but Amorim counted on him as one of his most senior players last season.",
      "United have plenty of options at centre-half, even after Lindelof and Evans left the club on free transfers at the end of last month.",
      "Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez are four solid options to form the back three, while Luke Shaw has been used more as a centre-back than a left-wing-back under Amorim.",
      "Add in impressive youngsters Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson to the mix, as well as the fact Noussair Mazraoui can be used as a centre-half, too, then United have eight options to fill in for three positions.",
      "At wing-back, United also have Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot on the right, while January signing Patrick Dorgu and teenager Harry Amass have impressed on the left-hand side. Amad can also be used as a right-wing-back, while Shaw remains an option on the left.",

      "The veteran goalkeeper recently penned a new one-year deal and will remain United's third choice goalkeeper this season.",
      "A knee injury will likely rule him out of the start of the season but the Argentina international remains a key figure in United's backline heading into the new campaign.",
      "De Ligt was one of United's better performers in his first season at the club and is expected to play a key role at the back this term.",
      "His United career has been full of ups and downs but he has emerged as one of their most consistent performers in the last couple of seasons. Recently penned a one year extension to keep him at the club this season.",
      "The teenage defender joined from Arsenal in January and made an immediate impression at first team level. He made six appearances last season and would have made more but for injury. Expect him to be around the first team squad this season to gain more experience.",
      "The 20-year-old academy graduate made the step up to first team level last season and impressed. He made two appearances for the first team but may find opportunities limited this term. A loan move away from United could be an option",
      "Shaw's injury record has been an issue that has defined his time at United. His talent is undoubted but it is hard to see where he fits into this United side now. He is an option at centre-back and left-back but certainly isn't in the club's strongest XI any more. If there was interest from elsewhere United may well be open to a conversation.",
      "Mazraoui was one of United's most consistent performers last season, both at centre-half and at wing-back. He remains a strong option for both positions and won't be going anywhere this summer.",
      "Dalot is one of Amorim's most trusted players and can offer the versatility of being able to play on either side as a wing-back.",
      "The Danish international arrived from Lecce in January and quickly asserted himself in the starting XI. The left-wing-back slot in the team is his to lose this season and United have high hopes about his future.",
      "The teenage wing-back made the step up to the first team last season and impressed. He is expected to be kept around the squad this season as he continues his development.",
      "The new signing has plenty of first team experience in Paraguay despite still being a teenager. He is expected to link up with the under-21s to begin with as he makes the adaptation to English football",
      "Malacia's future at Old Trafford is bleak. He has asked to leave the club this summer but interest is limited at the moment after an indifferent loan spell at PSV.",
      "The jury is still out on the Uruguayan international midfielder after his first season at the club. He is a player Amorim knows well from working together at Sporting, though, and he remains a key player to try and install the manager's message on the pitch.",
      "The veteran midfielder wants to stay at United and was one of Amorim's most trusted players towards the end of last season. The 33-year-old is in the final year of his contract though and this summer represents the last chance to extract a fee for his services.",
      "Collyer established himself as a first team player last season and looked tidy when he was relied upon. The competition is deep in midfield and his future, potentially with a loan move, could be one to watch later in the window.",
      "Mainoo's case is an interesting one. He is yet to pen a new deal with the club, despite talks, and has been linked with a move to Chelsea. His breakthrough 2023/24 season was outstanding but injuries and Amorim seemingly not being sure of how he best fits in his system curtailed his progress last term. Still aged just 20 United will want his future to be at the club but a sale would represent pure profit. One to watch.",
      "The captain is indispensable to United and talk of a £100million move to Al-Hilal earlier this summer was quickly rubbished. He remains United's most important player.",
      "Mount's first two seasons at the club haven't gone to plan but if he can stay fit this season he will have a big role to play under Amorim. He has been linked with a move away from the club but there is a feeling among all parties that he still has unfinished business at United.",
      "Amad was arguably United's best performer aside from Fernandes last season. Adept at both right-wing-back and in an attacking midfield role, he is a player Amorim will look to build his team around.",
      "Rashford has informed United of his desire to leave the club this summer having spent the second half of the season on loan at Aston Villa. He has no future under Amorim and Barcelona and Bayern Munich are said to be monitoring his situation.",
      "Garnacho has also told United he wants to leave the club. His talent is undoubted but his misdemeanours have angered Amorim. Chelsea, Napoli, Aston Villa and Atletico Madrid are monitoring his situation.",
      "Sancho is for sale as he heads into the final year of his contract at United. He has spent the last 18 months away from the club on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea. The Blues opted against signing him permanently and he has been linked with a move to Juventus.",
      "Antony is another player whose future lies elsewhere. He has been one of United's biggest flops in recent years but has reinvigorated his career with a successful loan spell at Real Betis. United need to sell him for £32.85m to avoid a PSR loss.",
      "United's new £62.5million signing should quickly become one of Amorim's most important players. He scored 17 goals for Wolves last season and should help aid United's goalscoring woes",
      "Hojlund has failed to convince during his first two seasons at the club and United need an upgrade up front. He is still young with time on his side but interest from Italy could well materialise into something",
      "Zirkzee endured a mixed first season at United and there is already talk of a return to Serie A. United aren't actively looking to offload the Dutch international but his situation is one to watch.",
      "The teenage forward is prolific at youth level and stepped up to first team level last season. He is expected to remain around the squad this season and continue to develop around United's first team players."

      "He might have been a perfect solution for United to consider but it is believed he has already agreed personal terms on a move to Bayern Munich.",
      "While the two clubs are yet to agree a fee, it is thought that Woltemade is ready to make the move to the Alianz Arena, whether it is this summer or the next."

      "The 20-year-old made 24 appearances in his debut campaign at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time. He also helped them reach the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League.",
      "Having made such a telling impression, the former Forest Green Rovers loanee is now being linked with a cluster of clubs, including German outfits Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen.",
      "The defensive midfielder, who can also operate at the back, was sold by United last summer for a small initial fee, which included a substantial future sell-on clause to ensure profit in the event of him making a name for himself in Poland.",
      "It is understood Oyedele has a release clause in his Legia contract worth €6million (£5.18m at the current exchange rate). It has been widely reported that the sell-on clause United inserted into the deal was worth 40 per cent, meaning they stand to bank just north of £2m.",
      "In a summer in which sales are crucial for United to generate money to raise funds for new arrivals, every penny they secure will be welcomed.",
      "United improved their success rate in the seller's market in last summer's transfer window, offloading a crop of players they felt had either run out of time at Old Trafford or were unlikely to ever make the grade.",
      "As was the case with Oyedele's switch to Legia, United inserted sell-on clauses into a several deals that saw youngsters offloaded. Any funds the Reds bank via sell-on clauses will assist them in their efforts to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United also inserted a buy-back clause into the deal that saw Oyedele move to Poland, meaning they have the option to re-sign him. He has also been linked with a return to England amid interest from unnamed Championship clubs."

      "In a summer where signing a new forward has been deemed a major transfer priority after their struggles in front of goal last season, signing a forward with a chequered injury record on a free transfer is hardly the transformative move they need to make.",
      "United scored 44 Premier League goals last season which was the fifth worst record in the Premier League. Only the three relegated teams and Everton, who Calvert-Lewin played for, scored less.",

      "It is only four years ago Calvert-Lewin was in the England squad that reached the final of the European Championships.",
      "Under Carlo Ancelotti, Calvert-Lewin scored 21 goals in the 2020/21 season. He was fit, firing and scoring goals and playing with a team who played to his strengths.",
      "The challenge for whatever new club the former Sheffield United forward ends up at is to try and regain that consistency of playing games regularly and scoring goals.",

      "The striker was hotly tipped for a move to the Premier League a year ago, with the Reds, Arsenal and Chelsea all reportedly interested. However, the Nigerian international did not secure a move to one of Europe's elite leagues and instead joined Turkish side Galatasaray.",
      "In Turkey, Osimhen found the back of the net 37 times, sparking fresh speculation about his next destination. The market for strikers is particularly competitive this summer, with many of Europe's top clubs looking to bolster their attacking options.",
      "United have seen their options further limited with the news that Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres looks almost certain to join top-flight rivals Arsenal. The Athletic are reporting the former Coventry City man is in advanced talks with the Gunners.",
      "And reports from Corriere dello Sport, via CalcioMercato, claim that Osimhen has rejected a big-money offer from Saudi club Al-Hilal and is set on staying in Turkey.",
      "The report claims that companies in Turkey are prepared to play their part, offering sponsorships to help cover the cost of his €75million (£64m) release clause.",
      "Therefore, it is reported that it could only be a matter of time before Galatasaray present a formal offer to Napoli, and any other interested parties will have to act fast to avoid missing out.",
      "Speaking last month, Galatasaray vice president Abdullah Kavukcu said: \"Osimhen must decide as soon as possible. He always asks us for time, we respect that, he has a family too, but time runs out.",
      "\"We have made a much higher offer than other European clubs and at the moment we are not negotiating other strikers. We are not thinking about plan B, we want Osimhen . We have already spoken to Napoli too .",
      "\"Our goal is to build a team that can compete with teams from all over the world, not just in Turkey. We must be patient. We are working day and night.\""

      "There was hope at Old Trafford that Mbeumo would have been able to join his potential new teammates ahead of a crucial pre-season for Ruben Amorim's squad. However, a deal is yet to be agreed.",
      "And if a move for Mbeumo is completed, the forward will have a dream shirt number available to him. The Cameroon international wears the number 19 for Brentford and his national team. United’s last 19 was centre-back Raphael Varane, and it’s still vacant since the Frenchman left in 2024.",
      "United's pre-season campaign kicks off against Leeds United in Stockholm on July 19. Shortly after their journey to Sweden, the club then fly to the United States to take part in the Premier League Summer Series - where they will face West Ham, Bournemouth, and Everton.",
      "United will be hoping to have Mbeumo in situ before their first pre-season game, but Brentford appear to be in no rush to sell. And the Bees sporting director has recently revealed that their star forward may stay for the 2025/26 season.",
      "\"From what I understand, if needs be, he's happy to stay at Brentford next year as well, so listen, let's see on that. I think our position is he had an unbelievable season last year, and we expected interest in him. If that deal is right, then there's a deal to do, but if not, then he'll stay.\"",

      "\"There is interest. He had a great season last season, so the interest is inevitable. If we get the right offer, there is potentially a deal to be done, but there's only so much we can say on that.\""

      "In the meantime, United have been working hard attempting to get transfers over the line. Matheus Cunha became their first summer signing for £62.5million at the start of last month, and while Diego Leon has since arrived from Cerro Porteno, the club's search for their next marquee addition has been slow.",

      "I don't see that being a problem as Rashford is still a serious talent and has a lot to offer in the game, but I think his wages might be a sticking point. Barcelona, however, would be the ideal destination for him.",

United had put a £40m price tag on Antony's head but it now appears that they have lowered that as attempts are increased to get him off their books.",
      "MEN says: Like Rashford, Antony has to be sold this summer. He doesn't feature as part of Amorim's plans and United would be best to cash in and cut their losses. While the Reds wanted £40m for him at first, they appear to have made the smart decision to lower their valuation and see if they can get him off their books.",
      "For his career, a move back to Betis would be the preferred solution for Antony. He was excellent in southern Spain for the latter end of the season and got back to his best after a difficult time in Manchester."

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",
      "He will receive a brilliant reception and it's great to see him enjoying his football again."

      "And then there's United. 15th in the Premier League last season, no European football to look forward and a mishmash of a squad that needs gutting.",
      "The summer transfer window represents a crucial time for two sides looking to send a message to the rest of the Premier League. Outgoings will be as important as incomings, and the two clubs may find themselves in direct competition.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish both enjoyed superb 2022/23 seasons, with the former bagging the first 30-goal haul of his career and Grealish playing a vital role in City's historical treble. Their stock has fallen dramatically since then and both could be on the move this summer.",
      "Rashford has told United he wants to leave and City are searching for a buyer for Grealish. While Rashford and Grealish are two very different players, both forwards will command hefty wages and their respective clubs won't be willing to let them leave for pennies - United want £40m for Rashford and that same figure is claimed to be enough to sign Grealish this summer.",
      "Moving them on isn't going to be easy, and the task will only be made tougher by a club on the other side of the city looking to sell a player who will undoubtedly be linked with the same clubs.",
      "Few could have envisioned Rashford and Grealish being sold a few years ago. Both players needs to find new clubs this summer, but that's easier said than done."

      "“It depends on how bad the manager wants him,” he told Express Sport with Razed. “If they want him that bad, they will end up paying the price and he brings goals at Brentford in what is a tidy side but not a top of the table or top four dominant team that will create more chances than the opposition.",
      "“His record speaks for itself with plenty of goals, chances created, and he has lots of pace to trouble defences in behind. His work rate is really good and he is happy to track back and do the ugly stuff. He will be hungry and is young which is what United need at the moment.”",

However, last month, Sporting Clube de Portugal president Frederico Varandas made it clear that the striker wouldn't be departing for €60million (£51m) plus €10m (£8m) in add-ons, as was previously rumoured.",

      "Sporting are understood to be holding out for a fee in the region of €80million (£69m) for their star player.",

      "Portuguese newspaper A Bola has now suggested that Sporting might be open to negotiating the €80m asking price with 'realistic variables', hinting at a possible €70m (£60m) upfront payment with an additional €10m (£8m) in performance-related bonuses.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to return for pre-season training on Monday, July 7, yet whether he will show up remains uncertain amid speculation in Portugal to the contrary.",

      "The academy graduate is one of the five players to have told the club he is seeking opportunities away from Old Trafford, and he will not return to Carrington for pre-season next week. Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have all had their return date pushed back until mid July to offer them the opportunity to find a new club.",
      "Rashford's United career has been over for some time, and his number 10 shirt being passed to Matheus Cunha was the final nail in the coffin. But what comes next?",
      "The academy graduate recently floated the possibility of playing at Barcelona in a chat with a Spanish influencer, but with the Catalan giants struggling to balance the books even before they were slapped with a £13m fine, are they genuinely in a position to offer Rashford what he will want?",
      "Not only will Rashford demand a hefty salary, there's also the transfer fee to consider. United want £40m for the England international, and while Barca aren't exactly working on a shoestring budget, there's been a notable tightening of the purse strings over the last couples of seasons at Camp Nou.",
      "With wages totalling nearly £17m a year and a £40m transfer fee, Rashford won't come cheap. One of the biggest clubs in Europe being handed a £13m isn't the news United or Rashford wanted."

      "According to reports, one key issue is preventing Manchester United from completing a double deal worth around £65m in a triple blow for the Red Devils.",
      "This summer is vital for the Red Devils as they require a significant overhaul after finishing 15th in the Premier League, while their loss to Spurs in the Europa League final leaves them without European football.",
      "But Man Utd have endured a tough start to this summer’s transfer window, with Matheus Cunha their only summer signing.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side are keen for Bryan Mbuemo to be their next summer signing, while they are also in the market for a new striker and upgrades in other positions.",
      "United, second in our Premier League net spend table, also need to offload unwanted talents to balance the books, with it claimed last week that Antony, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho have ‘informed’ the club that they ‘wish to leave’.",
      "When asked who is the closest to leave, journalist Ben Jacobs claimed he “expects Antony’s situation to develop”.",
      "“I expect the Antony situation to develop because Antony wants Real Betis and Betis want Antony,” Jacobs told Betway.",
      "READ: Rashford to Arsenal among eight logical Man Utd transfer reunions this summer",
      "“It’s just whether or not Manchester United sanction a loan with an option or an obligation, because if they don’t, Betis can’t afford to sign Antony permanently, and that’s what would throw his future more up in the air.",
      "“Antony’s pushing to go back to Betis, and the player side is trying to advance that as fast as they can.”",
      "However, Rashford, Sancho and Garnacho are not close to an exit at this stage.",
      "Jacobs insists the same issue is preventing deals for Rashford and Sancho worth around £65m, while “there’s no real advancement” regarding Garnacho.",
      "“Marcus Rashford’s situation may take a little bit longer because if Barcelona are to make a move, they want a loan. They might have to wait until later in the window,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“Bayern are still deciding who to go for, but at least they’d be able to afford the £40 million. So there might be movement in July on Rashford because he wants to play Champions League football and move as quickly as possible, but the asking price plus Rashford’s wage is certainly a stumbling block.",
      "“Jaden Sancho would have to drop his wage demands to get a quick move. There’s a relative market value £25 million that is quite appealing to suitors for Sancho, and there are a couple of clubs in Italy that are exploring that deal.",
      "“But Sancho will have to lower his wage demands, otherwise nothing will progress there. So, it will depend how badly he wants a particular club.",
      "“At least from the perspective of suitors with Sancho, the club-to-club negotiation with Manchester United is a little bit smoother because Manchester United are taking the obligation of up to £25 million that was there for Chelsea, and they’re prepared to sell for the same price.",
      "“And then with Garnacho, there’s no real advancement at this stage despite several clubs exploring the deal, including Napoli, and also Chelsea prior to adding Jamie Gittins.",
      "“And Manchester United would like this one to happen quickly because it represents pure profit on the books.",
      "“But at this stage, there’s nothing too advanced on the Garnacho front, but I would still be surprised if he’s a Manchester United player come the end of the window.”",
      "Man Utd will welcome any suitor for their band of misfits and here are eight possible reunions which could aid what currently looks like a woefully inadequate summer rebuild.",

      "",
      "Jadon Sancho – Besiktas\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has ‘asked about the conditions’ required to bring him to Turkey after Juventus predictably pulled out of a potential swap deal over excessive wages that continue to screw Sancho, United and pretty much every other player they’re currently trying to get off their books while offering similarly extortionate salaries to new signings having clearly failed to learn their redundancy-forcing lesson.",
      "So yeah, the conditions are a £25m transfer fee and a £300,000-per-week wage, or a small loan fee and a great reduction in that wage when United get desperate towards the end of the window and are forced to subsidise his exit. Probably wait for that.",
      "",
      "Tyrell Malacia – Feyenoord\nAs miserable Manchester United footballers go – and there are over 30 of them to choose from – we would suggest Malacia is among the most downcast.",
      "“I can promise the United fans that I will leave everything on the pitch every time I pull on the red shirt,” he said when Erik ten Hag signed him in 2022. And we don’t doubt that he has, he’s just not good enough and him being injured or on loan for the majority of his three years as a Red Devil has probably been a blessing.",
      "A spell at PSV Eindhoven last term didn’t pan out and here’s hoping Rene Hake – Ten Hag’s assistant at United; now assistant at Feyenoord – can persuade the club where Malacia made his name to take what would be an inexpensive punt on the full-back.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho – Bayer Leverkusen\nLike Amorim, Ten Hag had the occasional off-field issue with Garnacho, but unlike Amorim, the Dutchman maintained a supportive stance throughout their time together at Old Trafford, citing his age and trajectory to excuse the Argentinian’s ill-advised social media activity while doing everything possible to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "Garnacho went from an unknown to a player linked with £70m transfers in their time together a the club, so Ten Hag was doing something right.",
      "He wants an opportunity to continue forging that relationship now he’s pitched up at Bayer Leverkusen, who have both money to spend and a creativity dearth to make up for following Florian Wirtz’s move to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford – Arsenal\nHe’s not being ousted by Manchester United because he’s crap, but because – rightly or wrongly – Ruben Amorim sees him as a poor influence on the dressing room.",
      "In a squad so clearly all pulling in the right direction under Mikel Arteta, we can’t see him being an issue, and we’re not convinced by the logic of gifting Chelsea another £50m to sign a guy with the potential to be Rashford when the actual Rashford is available for £40m.",
      "We get that Arsenal have been burned by the signing of Raheem Sterling last summer, but it was nothing a few minutes under the cold tap wouldn’t sort, and Rashford’s a very different case.",
      "There was little evidence of there being much left of the Sterling who scored goals for fun at Manchester City when the Gunners took him on loan, while it was clear in six months at Aston Villa that Rashford remains a potentially world-class adjacent winger, as he was when Gunners assistant Albert Stuivenberg was working under Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford.",
      "In the right environment he could do the business to drive a team like Arsenal to major silverware, and not in one or two seasons, as may be the case with Noni Madueke, but next season, when it’s do or die for Arteta.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood – Fenerbahce\nIt was Solskjaer who handed Greenwood his United debut but Jose Mourinho called him up to train with the first team some two years after he was denied that same request as regulations ruled out the 15-year-old’s participation – he was well aware of the striker’s quality and it was claimed last month that the Portuguese boss had requested Fenerbahce bosses to look into his signing.",
      "A report on Sunday claimed Al-Ahli have ‘submitted an offer of £60m’ for Greenwood, which will be music to Manchester United ears after club bosses displayed out-of-character cunning by inserting a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal which saw him move to Marseille for £23m last summer.",
      "Whether Greenwood will be attracted by the ludicrous wages remains to be seen, but if he wants more of a balance between pay packet and football quality then a move to Turkey may be in the offing, and Fenerbahce’s big-money move for Jhon Duran shows their desire this summer to close what has been an increasing gap to Galatasaray.",

      "",
      "Antony – Bayer Leverkusen\nTen Hag wanted Antony at Old Trafford having worked with him at Ajax but actually warned the club against spending £85m on the winger, presumably because he worked with him at Ajax.",
      "He wouldn’t need anywhere near that much to reunite with him in the Bundesliga, which may be another league well suited to the 25-year-old, who’s thrived in La Liga after impressing in the Eredivisie.",

      "Casemiro – Al Nassr\nCristiano Ronaldo isn’t technically the Al Nassr manager, but actual manager Jorge Jesus will be under no illusions as to who’s making the transfer decisions after CR7 signed his new £488,000-per-day contract while any rumour leads on Ronaldo ‘pushing’ or ‘urging’ so-and-so’s signing.",
      "Casemiro was a dead-man walking for over a year at Old Trafford with United not just opening doors but baking pies to entice buyers for the Brazilian, but after an uptick in his displays at the end of the season led to an international recall he now wants to see out his contract in the hope of heading to the 2026 World Cup.",
      "United would still welcome what would be a hefty transfer fee and to have his mammoth wages off the books; all they need is a call from Ronaldo and a promise from Carlo Ancelotti to see the back of him.",
      "",
      "Luke Shaw – Ajax\nWe were of course tempted by the thought of Mourinho laying on some sort of mobility scooter/cart to lug Shaw through Istanbul Airport in a bid to further fat-shame the full-back after signing him for Fenerbahce, but we’re guessing the Englishman probably doesn’t fancy putting himself through that trauma no matter the tax-free riches he would receive in the Turkish Super Lig.",
      "Van Gaal, who signed him from Southampton for United in 2014, also criticised Shaw’s fitness when he first arrived at the club, but the left-back later insisted Van Gaal “helped me a lot” and was a “great manager”.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £61.7m\nThe Black Cats made Noah Sadiki their third summer signing and are far from finished following promotion to the Premier League.",
      "",
      "8) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "6) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper has propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund, £27.8m to £32m, June 2025)\nOther interested parties included Bundesliga rivals Leipzig and Frankfurt but it is a remarkably strong pitch to simply ask a player how their brother is doing. Dortmund primed Jude for superstardom and Jobe will be eyeing those footsteps like any other hand-me-down.",
      "",
      "19) Jude Bellingham (Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund, £22.5m to £30m, July 2020)\nManchester United pulled out all the stops and even wheeled in Sir Alex Ferguson but Borussia Dortmund’s pitch involved nonsense like clear pathways to the first team and boring Bellingham decided to make the best possible decision for his career instead of picking based on banter and vibes because he is boring.",
      "Within four months of his Germany move, Bellingham was firmly embedded in the England set-up, not to be moved for about two decades. He cannot have been far off doing a Jay Bothroyd and claiming a Three Lions caps while playing for a lower-division club.",
      "",
      "18) Aaron Ramsdale (Sheffield United to Arsenal, £24m to £30m, August 2021)\nRamsdale was as uncapped by the senior England side when he joined Arsenal as when he moved back to Sheffield United from Bournemouth the year before. The only difference this time was the ridicule he faced upon that switch to north London as a twice-relegated keeper signed as back-up for Bernd Leno.",
      "It took Ramsdale a couple of months to prove the doubters wrong and not much longer to force his way into the England picture. But both club and country moved on quickly to leave him stranded in the Championship.",
      "",
      "17) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",

      "16) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "15) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "14) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "13) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "12) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "11) Jarell Quansah (Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m to £35m, July 2025)\nA winner of the U19 and U21 Euros, having captained England at various levels and been on Gareth Southgate’s standby list for Euro 2024, is destined to make the senior grade at some point.",
      "Quansah was even in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad and Liverpool will be among those keen to monitor how he fares in Germany.",
      "",
      "10) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "9) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "8) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Barca boost for Rashford? Arsenal could sign six players\n👉 Eze to Arsenal and Watkins to Man Utd: Best of the rest reassigned to Premier League big boys",
      "",
      "7) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "6) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "5) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mohammed Kudus are desperate to take a step down to complete dream moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "A former Chelsea defender has offered his thoughts on Liam Delap, suggesting he ‘can shine’ with the help of ‘elite’ players like Cole Palmer.",
      "A “very good source” has confirmed that Arsenal want to sign a rival Premier League winger, per Sami Mokbel, but it’s been said the transfer “doesn’t make sense” for one ...",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have ‘submitted a proposal’ as they look to finalise their third summer signing, while they could also raid Newcastle United.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap in the summer, and it’s already been noted by Micah Richards how he’ll link up “very well” with Cole Palmer after their first match ..."

      "Marcus Rashford is not wanted by Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim and has plenty of interest from abroad, but that salary of his is proving to be quite the hurdle.",
      "Where will Rashford go? Is staying at United completely off the table? Will he flee the country for a fresh start? It’s a World Cup year, making this summer absolutely crucial. We’ve ranked his 10 most realistic transfer options in what promises to be a long, long window.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United\nStaying at Old Trafford seems to be the most unlikely scenario for Rashford. He definitely has the ability to come Back Stronger, but it all comes down to Ruben Amorim and whether or not he wants to welcome back a player he publicly said he doesn’t want.",
      "There really does feel like no way back for Rashford at Manchester United, especially after Matheus Cunha took the No.10 shirt, but assuming it becomes an option, let’s weigh up the pros and cons.",
      "Getting the negative stuff out of the way first, it’s not likely that Rashford fits into Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system. He doesn’t really have the intelligence or playmaking ability to be a ‘wide 10’, and he’s not an out-and-out centre-forward. Or a wing-back. Then there’s the dressing-room precedent. Amorim put his big balls on the table with his decision to ostracise Rashford, and putting water under the bridge makes him look weak. His reasons for binning Rashford reportedly included his poor work ethic, and if he genuinely doesn’t work hard, why would they want to keep him?",
      "Well, s**t, that was a pretty compelling argument for selling him, if I do say so myself. But, err, he is good at football or something. When he can be arsed. Come on, Ruben – keep him, fella. Just for the vibes.",
      "",
      "9) Newcastle United\nThis move is increasingly unlikely after Newcastle bid £55million for Nottingham Forest winger Anthony Elanga, but one attacking sale can change things — and Eddie Howe still doesn’t have an adequate back-up for Alexander Isak. If he gets injured, the Magpies are in big trouble. Callum Wilson can no longer be relied on even if he signs a contract extension.",
      "Rashford’s ability to play anywhere in attack makes him an appealing target. The big issue — and this will be a theme here — is his current salary and unwillingness to accept a lower wage.",
      "Newcastle’s wage structure will not be broken for Rashford. They’re scared to do it for Isak, and he’s their best player since Alan Shearer. Breaking the bank for them — despite their billions — is paying Isak £200,000 a week. Amazingly, that would be a significant pay cut for Rashford.",
      "",
      "8) Saudi Arabia\nThe last resort. It’s hard to see Rashford giving up on elite football entirely at 27, but if the money’s right and no one else is biting…",
      "MORE RASHFORD FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Trent ‘defensively solid’? Really? Plus Rashford SHOCK and Boxing Day\n👉 Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd, Man City outcasts and Spurs captain Son…\n👉 Aston Villa and Brighton duos in 10 Premier League loanees ready to shine in 2025/26",
      "",
      "7) Turkey\nSee: Saudi Arabia. But Turkey is slightly more ambitious from a footballing perspective. If he still vaguely cares about the sport, this is the better option. Not by much, mind.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea\nSurely not, right? Well…this is Chelsea after all. They remain linked with Mohammed Kudus and Alejandro Garnacho despite signing Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens, so Rashford shouldn’t be completely ruled out.",
      "Mykhaylo Mudryk’s future remains uncertain, Jadon Sancho hasn’t been signed permanently, and Noni Madueke is an Arsenal target. There’s definitely a chance. If there’s one team that loves a dysfunctional forward, it’s Chelsea.",
      "",
      "5) Aston Villa\nIn truth, a loan to Villa for a full season after six months in 2024/25 is more likely than a permanent transfer. It all comes down to Rashford’s current salary and his desire to continue earning a frankly absurd weekly wage of at least £315,000.",
      "We literally saw the upsides of this move play out last season when he enjoyed playing football again under Unai Emery. Rashford is clearly a player the Spaniard likes, and the managerial expert knows how to get a tune out of him.",
      "Paying £40million and then a colossal wage is just not an option for the Villans. That’s not even an unreasonable transfer fee to demand, but coupled with his salary, there has to be some serious wiggle room.",
      "Or United could cover a percentage of Rashford’s salary. At this stage, they just need him sold.",
      "",
      "4) Juventus or Napoli\nTwo for the price of one here, with Italian giants Juventus and Napoli both in contention.",
      "Signing an overpaid United outcast would be pretty on-brand for Juventus, who currently have two very impressive young wingers in Kenan Yildiz and Francisco Conceicao, and recently added Nico Gonzalez.",
      "Antonio Conte’s side, meanwhile, are still looking for a replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. A move abroad is surely the most likely outcome for Rashford this summer. The new environment would do him a world of good, and playing for one of Europe’s elite in the Champions League would do his England prospects no harm.",
      "Serie A clubs are notoriously stingy, which makes his wage demands a huge stumbling block. If playing in Italy really appeals to Rashford, he could take a pay cut. That’s probably wishful thinking, but the footballing logic checks out.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal\nMikel Arteta wants a new left winger, with an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli one of the ingredients required to win a first Premier League title in over two decades.",
      "Is Rashford the answer? Is he a clear upgrade on the Brazilian? We’re not entirely convinced, but at his best, he probably is. The problem is neither seems likely to hit those 2022/23 peaks again.",
      "Arsenal’s clear desire to improve in the position that Rashford plays is a big reason for their high placement in this ranking. However, they are definitely focusing on different targets.",
      "Real Madrid’s Rodrygo is reportedly the ‘dream’, while Rafael Leao, Anthony Gordon and Nico Williams are likely higher in Arteta’s and sporting director Andrea Berta’s thinking.",
      "",
      "2) Barcelona\nHansi Flick’s side would be top if it wasn’t for their financial situation. They’ve had to move on from Nico Williams due to registration issues, though his Athletic Bilbao contract extension also suggests he wanted his future sorted early.",
      "This move is perfect. Flick’s front three have very little defensive responsibility and lots of freedom to express themselves. Lamine Yamal is a special boy and would shine under any manager (surely), but he’s struck gold having the German as a head coach. Raphinha, meanwhile, has been in genuine Ballon d’Or form under Flick.",
      "Barcelona are not a difficult team to be brilliant in, and in a World Cup year, that’s pretty ideal for Rashford. United want to sell, but this one could drag out.",
      "",
      "1) Bayern Munich\nThe aforementioned Williams is now off the table and Liverpool don’t want to sell Luis Diaz, so Bayern are seriously considering signing Rashford from the Red Devils.",
      "They are surely able to afford Rashford’s wages, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will agree to his demands. It’s all about what Rashford is worth to them — and given the two years he’s had, that is definitely not over £300k a week.",
      "AC Milan’s Rafael Leao is a more glamorous and realistic target — and he’s better — but you get the feeling that Bayern are properly sniffing around Rashford. Their desperation to sign a left winger is clear as day, and Rashford would absolutely thrive in the Bundesliga against the naive high lines of your Heidenheims and Werder Bremens.",
      "It’s just a question of whether Bayern believe he’s worth the hassle — and the wage.",

      "Marcus Rashford’s hopes of a Barcelona move have received a boost, while Arsenal are intensifying their efforts to sign a Chelsea forward…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Tino Livramento – Newcastle to Manchester City\nAn £80m offer from City has been reported, and they do need a new right-back, even if Matheus Nunes is improving there.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. And Berta, evidently, hasn’t sufficiently seduced the striker’s agents. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca like Luis Diaz but Liverpool are either keen to keep the Colombian or they will only sell for money Barca don’t have. Which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "13) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo. But Rodrygo might be too pricey; Williams seems to be staying in Bilbao; and Eze could be signed separately. Romano reckons more talks have taken place, but seemingly not between the clubs.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London almost a fortnight ago to complete his move, but if we know anything about Arsenal this summer, it’s that they won’t be rushed."

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
