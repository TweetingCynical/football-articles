      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has insisted the Glazers will not interfere with any decision regarding head coach Ruben Amorim's future. The United head coach has come under mounting pressure this season following a sluggish start to the new Premier League campaign.",
      "The Red Devils are currently in 10th position in the league, having collected 10 points from their opening seven league fixtures. A 2-0 victory over Sunderland in their most recent match has temporarily dulled speculation surrounding the manager's position, though another poor run of form is expected to reignite the debate.",
      "Ratcliffe will play a pivotal role in determining Amorim's fate.",
      "Whilst he acknowledges the disappointment felt by certain supporters, the co-owner has suggested he is willing to afford the manager additional time.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" Ratcliffe told The Business Podcast.",
      "\"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch.",
      "\"You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Discussing his relationship with fellow co-owners, the Glazer family, Ratcliffe revealed they were comfortable allowing him to take control.",
      "When questioned about what he would do if they instructed him to dismiss Amorim, he simply responded: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "Amorim penned a three-year contract at Old Trafford in November last year. Ratcliffe has signalled that he is prepared to grant him time to reverse the club's fortunes.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" he said.",

      "United will hope their new training ground can help spark better results under Ruben Amorim and that it can now avoid any embarrassing criticism. Their wait to improve facilities means they've taken the brunt of a dig on this occasion.",

      "Manchester United have been handed a Bryan Mbeumo boost during the October international break. The Cameroonian, who moved to Old Trafford from Brentford this summer for a huge £65million, plus an additional £6m in add-ons, has hit the ground running under Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward, who netted 20 times in the Premier League last season, has already chalked up two goals and an assist across all competitions. Mbeumo has been a constant presence on the pitch, playing the full 90 minutes in all but one match so far in the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The 26-year-old is currently representing his country, Cameroon, where he's continued to showcase his impressive form. The former Troyes ace came off the bench to find the back of the net against Mauritius in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday.",
      "Despite only being on the pitch for 13 minutes in his country's 2-0 triumph, Mbeumo managed to score, with Red Devils goalkeeper Andre Onana, currently on loan at Trabzonspor, keeping a clean sheet.",
      "News of Mbeumo's goal and his limited game time will be music to Amorim's ears. Having one of his standout performers not overly exerted can only be a positive for United's beleaguered head coach, while the fact that Mbeumo found the back of the net in his brief stint on the pitch is a bonus for his confidence too.",
      "Amorim will now be crossing his fingers that one of his star attackers comes through unscathed in Cameroon's next match - a home clash against Angola on Monday. United will be hoping Mbeumo returns fit and firing for the Premier League showdown with Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday, October 19.",
      "Regardless of what transpires during this international break, United are aware that Mbeumo is almost certain to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations, kicking off in late December. Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are also expected to take part in the tournament, which spans from December 21 to January 18.",
      "Mbeumo has recently defended Amorim's contentious 3-4-2-1 formation at United, insisting it's not the root cause of the team's ongoing struggles under the Portuguese manager.",
      "The Red Devils managed to secure a much-needed 2-0 victory against Sunderland before the international break, but they currently languish in 10th place in the Premier League and were ousted from the League Cup by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"Obviously, we hear a lot of things, but it's our responsibility to find the good things and to be better.",
      "\"I don't think there is anything about this system, it's just us and improving in certain areas.\"",

      "Manek is set to relocate northwards where he will be responsible for managing United's Carrington training ground. His remit will also include overseeing 'travel, security, the training facilities and staff management and infrastructure.'",
      "He is the latest in a series of leadership appointments at the club, following Omar Berrada's move from Manchester City, Jason Wilcox taking up the post of technical director, and Marc Armstrong stepping in as the club's chief business officer.",
      "Interestingly, the position of director of football operations was previously made redundant by United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, with David Harrison holding the role from 2023 until 2025.",
      "Harrison was let go earlier this year, marking one of the most high-profile exits amid Ratcliffe's cost-cutting measures.",
      "Manek will now fill that vacancy, as per the BBC, after a three-year stint with the Bees. He initially joined the club as business operations director before being promoted to the role of chief operating officer in July 2024.",
      "Before his time at Brentford, Manek spent five years at Arsenal, eventually becoming head of first-team football operations.",
      "His former position at the Bees was said to be more administrative, but his new role at United will reportedly involve a greater emphasis on football matters for both the men's and women's squads.",

The Portuguese replaced Erik ten Hag almost 12 months ago but could only lead United to a 15th place finish in the Premier League last season. That was their lowest finish for half a century and defeat in the Europa League final to Spurs ensured they failed to qualify for Europe for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "Twice during his tenure so far has Amorim publicly offered to resign - if Ratcliffe and the rest of the club's hierarchy felt it was in the best interests of the club for him to go. But United chief Ratcliffe, who has complete control over the football operations at the club, insists \"good guy\" Amorim deserves to be judged over a three year period - the length of his contract - rather than his first year at the helm.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” said Ratcliffe. “Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "“That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight.",
      "\"Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.”",
      "Amorim led United to a 2-0 win over Sunderland at the weekend, which took them into the international break in 10th position in the Premier League.",
      "But he has taken only 37 points from a possible 102 at the helm and is coming in for widespread criticism for his stubborn refusal to change his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Asked whether the club's majority owners, the Glazers, may tell him to sack Amorim and what would happen, Ratcliffe insisted: “It’s not going to happen.”",

In his final outing before confirming such a major career decision, Alba netted twice in a 4-1 victory over New England with Messi providing one of the assists.",

      "\"The time has come to close a truly meaningful chapter in my life,\" he said in a video posted on Instagram.",

      "The comments on the post are filled with numerous big names sending well-wishes, though De Gea opted for a dedicated Instagram post to his former international team-mate.",

      "If we're being frank, Paul Scholes clearly knows a thing or two about what makes a top midfielder. But his pick when it comes to the Premier League's best right now has massively split opinion.",
      "I don't know if you can have a £105million bargain. But if you can, it's Declan Rice.",
      "The England midfielder has taken his career to the next level since leaving West Ham for Arsenal having steered the Hammers to their first major trophy since Trevor Brooking was a lad.",
      "He is arguably the Gunners' most important player and will be key if they are to finally end their Premier League title drought.",
      "Similarly, if Thomas Tuchel is to banish 60 years of hurt in the USA next summer, he will need his star midfielder firing on all cylinders.",
      "There are plenty of other contenders, Rodri would have been nailed on for this accolade before his injury having won the Ballon d'Or, but Rice's consistency and value to his side gives him the edge.",
      "An entirely subjective question based off little more than vibes? I’m sure this won’t annoy anybody.",
      "I currently think the league’s three best midfielders are Rice, Caicedo and Liverpool ’s Ryan Gravenberch. And while I don’t think you can go wrong picking any of them, I’ve decided to ignore the last two weeks and pick Gravenberch.",
      "Yes, Arne Slot’s side have hit a bit of a wall in the last fortnight, and yes, Gravenberch has been stifled during that run of three defeats. But I back him to get out of the funk pretty quickly and return to top form. At his best, he can do almost everything…very well.",
      "And like Caicedo, it’s good to remind yourselves every now and again that at 23 he could still become even better. At a pinch under £35m he is also one of the best value-for-money signings the title contenders have made in recent years. I’m a huge fan.",
      "Obviously some may have a different opinion but I struggle to look past Declan Rice here, simply because I think he's evolved into a different player to the one Arsenal signed for big, big money two years ago. And he was quality even back then.",
      "Rice has shown he is far more than a holding midfielder and has added goals and assists to his game, reaching double figures for goal contributions in both of his seasons in an Arsenal shirt so far. Part of that is down to his deadly dead balls, which have become a huge part of Arsenal's game.",
      "There's so many different facets of a midfielder's game, but a truly elite one is good at them all. Rice has grown into a player who can do it all. And I don't think there's anybody doing it better right now.",
      "The best midfielder in the Premier League, without any hint of competition, is Rodri. But given the Manchester City star has struggled with injuries for a lengthy period he can't be picked on current form.",
      "So in which case I'd say the stand out in the opening weeks of the season would be either Adam Wharton or Elliot Anderson - and how refreshing that neither players for a top six side. That said, they easily could, and some may argue it is only a matter of time until they are.",
      "Wharton has been impressing for a while now and continues to draw comparisons with some of the game's great players, all whilst doing so in a very impressive Crystal Palace side. Anderson meanwhile is fast showing that Nottingham Forest may not be able to keep hold of him for much longer.",
      "Anderson was a huge hit for the England U21s and is now part of the senior squad with both men looking destined to go to the World Cup in the summer.",
      "Sure, Bruno Fernandes has not got the trophies that your Rodris or your Caicedos have but it’s hard to argue that he isn’t one of - if not the - most effective midfielders in the Premier League. You only have to look at the numbers he’s put together during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "He’s scored 100 goals for the Red Devils, and provided a further 86 assists. You’d be hard pressed to find a midfielder, who has managed to put together similar numbers.",
      "He’s single-handedly dragged United along during the time he has been with the club. Is it beyond the realms of possibility that without him United could potentially have been relegated? I really don’t think it is.",
      "Fernandes is one of those rare players who would perfectly slot in with a number of United’s rivals should the chance arise. That’s not to discredit the efforts of Rodri, Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, who have all underlined how important they are to their respective sides.",
      "But the question remains whether their individual performances have been as crucial to the fortunes of their clubs as Fernandes’ have been. He can be petulant sometimes, absolutely, but that’s simply because he cares and is an elite athlete who only wants to win.",
      "Looking for the Premier League's best midfielder is a difficult task given the different roles and responsibilities of the division's best talents. But if you're looking for a figure who can do it all, it's hard to look past Declan Rice.",
      "The England international has firmly placed himself in the conversation as one of the league's best players, while not always being allowed to exhibit his best talents. Previously, he has been misidentified by many as someone only to be utilised with defensive responsibilities in mind. Given freedom to go forward, he will find a way to put an end to Paul Scholes' goalscoring criticisms.Even with a slow start to this season, Rice is a notable absentee for Mikel Arteta when unavailable. The 26-year-old's own high standards can make a decent performance seem underwhelming. A disruptor and a creator, Rice is more complete than most.",
      "Crucially, Rice can also deliver in some of the biggest moments. Those Champions League free kicks can't be ignored. If Arsenal are to find success, Rice will be central.",
      "Blimey, this is tough. I think we're now seeing a resurgence of midfielders who can do a bit of everything as opposed the days of rudimentary No.10s, No.8s and No.6s.",
      "My gut feeling was to say Rodri, but we just haven't seen enough of him over the past 12 months to reaffirm that he's still top of the pile. So I'll go for Declan Rice; a goalscorer from open play and set pieces, defensively astute, has an engine that can run all day and he's a leader.",
      "I love his new partner for Arsenal, Martin Zubimendi, while Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister has proven it at the very top level. Moises Caicedo is definitely entering the conversation and I think Sandro Tonali goes under the radar too often in this conversation.Also, can we call Bruno Fernandes a midfielder again? Not that I think Fernandes is the best but he deserves to be in the debate if he's playing in a deeper role - albeit his numbers have declined there, so it feels like a catch-22.",

      "\"I would be so surprised if the Manchester United job came available and Eddie Howe took it. I think it's a really, really tough job to take now,\" Hendrick told Boyle Sports.",
      "\"They're kind of stuck. You look at Ruben Amorim coming in, and he had a good profile of what he'd done previously, but he looks disheartened.",
      "\"He looks disheartened even though he's had a summer to get a couple of signings in. I think they're better off maybe sticking with him for another transfer window, but who knows if they will.",
      "\"Touching on Eddie Howe, he's got the run of the club at Newcastle now with how well he's done. He's able to bring in the players he wants, and let go of the players he doesn't want.",
      "\"The fans love him. I don't see why he'd leave. I think for him, his target is to consistently hit Champions League football with that club.\"",
      "United's next match after the international break will see them take on bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield on October 19. Amorim will be determined to continue their winning form when they leave Merseyside in just under two weeks time, with Liverpool on a three-game losing run including the latest two in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim was finally afforded a summer transfer window in the hope that it would improve his situation at Manchester United, but familiar issues remain even if some of his new arrivals have shown promise.",
      "The Portuguese head coach arrived midway through last season, immediately implementing his way of playing, despite not having the players that suited that style. He persevered regardless, leading to United's worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "This summer though he was able to plough more than £200million into his frontline with goals a particular problem last term. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony have left with two proven top flight performers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was also signed, despite huge interest from Newcastle, with the young striker eventually making the move for £74million.",
      "All the names on paper looked promising. A new goalkeeper in Senne Lammens was bought in on deadline day. His importance growing in light of Andre Onana's surprise loan move to Turkey late in the day.",
      "Paraguayan Diego Leon was also signed, he's talked up making a name for himself when he gets a chance, but he is likely to be more of a slow burner in Manchester. The overriding issue though for Amorim has been the continued failure of his system to get the right results.",
      "United's budget meant they couldn't get the midfielder they wanted, which has left Bruno Fernandes playing in the midfield two. That has given him more defensively responsibility and less attacking freedom, none of which has helped the Manchester outfit. There are plenty who believe this squad possesses good players, but they are being made to look worse by the system.",
      "Amorim saw his side beat Sunderland at the weekend, but that came after a loss at Brentford which highlighted the obvious flaws in how United are currently operating. If there are any positives it is that Cunha has looked sharp, Sesko is off the mark in front of goal and Mbeumo has had moments of quality. We take a look at United's summer arrivals and give them an early grading in Manchester.",
      "Delivered a composed first appearance in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last weekend and looks likely to retain his position ahead of Bayindir moving forwards. Controlled his area, comfortable with both feet, reasonable ball distribution and appears to be a dependable choice between the sticks.",
      "His start at United has been slower than anticipated following his £65m transfer from Wolves. After an injury in the Burnley victory, he returned at Brentford, where his cross to Mbeumo earned a penalty that Fernandes missed. With Mount back fit, Cunha's spot is now under threat.",
      "The standout signing for United this summer. He's made an immediate impact after his £71m move from Brentford. His two goals and one assist don't fully reflect his overall contribution, as his speed and diagonal runs behind enemy lines have added a new element to United's attack.",
      "It's taken him some time to find his feet, but his two goals in the last two matches suggest he's getting there. United are playing to Sesko's strengths, using long balls for the imposing striker to flick on for his teammates, while his poacher's instincts have resulted in his goals.",

      "Liverpool are keeping tabs on Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, who the Cherries now value at £75million with the winger enjoying another stellar season, which began with a brace at Anfield.",
      "Semenyo chose to remain at the Vitality Stadium in the summer despite seeing some of his big name team-mates move on after impressive years. The Reds are now weighing up a move with sporting director Richard Hughes also a big admirer of Semenyo having signed him from Bristol City when he was at Bournemouth.",
      "Semenyo then cost just £10.5m, but could now move on for more than seven times that given his continued rise at Bournemouth, reports talkSPORT. His stellar start to the season will only see the Cherries believe their hefty price tag is justified.",
      "The Ghanaian has six goals to his name, with only Erling Haaland above him across the Premier League. His individual quality has continued to aid Andoni Iraola's side as they again sit among the top sides.",
      "Manchester United weighed up a move for Semenyo in the summer, as did Tottenham, and it is understood that the Red Devils continue to keep tabs on the player. However he ended up signing a new deal with Bouremouth and Ruben Amorim instead landed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The United boss is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to get a gauge on the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth over the former Bristol star, but nothing ultimately came of it.",
      "United were ready to fork out £55m to sign Semenyo, who scored 13 times last season. However, the player himself is said to have committed his future to Bournemouth after learning that the Manchester outfit were planning to pay him less than what they offered to other targets.",
      "Liverpool's interest in Semenyo may be viewed as something of a surprise, especially given their number of attacking players and the current struggles with trying to fit them into an effective line-up. Hugo Ekitike, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz were all signed in the summer.",
      "They complement Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo, who were already at the club. One player who did swap Bournemouth for Liverpool recently was Milos Kerkez, but the Hungarian has so far found it difficult to replicate his level at Anfield with Andy Robertson often playing ahead of him.",

      "The Three Lions are currently preparing for a big friendly against Wales on Thursday before a World Cup qualifier with Latvia next week. And while the usual faces were involved in training on the eve of England's game with Wales, it has now emerged that three up-and-coming stars were also at St. Georges' Park, including Lacey.",
      "Lacey, 18, is one of Manchester United's most promising prospects and has already caught the eye among the Red Devils coaching staff. Per The Mail, United's young attacking midfielder was also joined by Lakyle Samuel, a 19-year-old Manchester City defender who has impressed on loan in League Two with Bromley, and Harrison Murray-Campbell, also 19 and a defender for Chelsea.",
      "Lacey was handed a squad number - 61 - ahead of the 2025-26 campaign and featured for United in pre-season. He, Samuel and Murray-Campbell have all been named in the England Under-20 squad and could feature when they face Switzerland on Friday.",
      "While Lacey and Co were involved on Wednesday, there was no Harry Kane on the St. Georges' Park pitches as the England captain is struggling with an ankle knock.",
      "Kane did not participate in training with the rest of his team-mates after suffering a knock in Bayern Munich's 3-0 win over against Eintracht Frankfurt. And the 32-year-old, who was replaced by Nicolas Jackson after receiving treatment late in the game, is now a major doubt for England's big game with Wales.",
      "He joined Jarell Quansah by taking part in an indoor routine at St. Georges' Park and could be replaced by Ollie Watkins or Marcus Rashford in Tuchel's starting XI on Thursday night.",
      "His absence will come as a blow to Tuchel, who lauded the former Tottenham talisman as the \"best striker of his generation\" recently. Speaking to Sport Bild, the England boss said: “He is undoubtedly the best striker of his generation. He has reached a new level and is now scoring two goals per game.",

      "Andre Onana is enjoying huge benefit from his loan spell away from Manchester United, but still plans to return to the Premier League side when his stint in Turkey is over.",
      "The Cameroon goalkeeper was surprisingly let go by the Red Devils after deadline day as they sanctioned a move to Trabzonspor, who are covering his £170,000 weekly wages in full. A new environment looks to be paying off for the goalkeeper, who endured a difficult two years at Old Trafford.",
      "Signed by Erik ten Hag, his time in Manchester was defined by high profile errors that often led to goals. His position came under threat when he didn't start the year as No 1 and Ruben Amorim opted to sign Senne Lammens late in the window.",
      "However The Sun reports that Onana is \"feeling the love\" in Turkey and that is helping him rediscover his best form. Those close to Onana admit the goalkeeper was mentally low after two challenging seasons.",
      "The ex-Inter Milan No 1 feels more relaxed and has regained confidence at Trabzonspor, who are second in the Turkish league behind champions Galatasaray, and they are exploring the possibility of signing him on a permanent basis.",
      "Onana's intention though is to make a return to Manchester, where he will hope to re-establish himself as their No 1. The goalkeeper privately accepts he struggled at United, despite often coming out to defend his actions and his record, even if he was dropped by Amorim last term.",
      "His last appearance for the Premier League side came as they were beaten on penalties by Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. The loss at Blundell Park is one of the lowest points in recent memory with Onana making another blunder and struggling to stop any spot kicks.",
      "Amorim confessed that a change of scenery was best for all involved. He said: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder. You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail.",
      "“I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",

      "Manchester United have suffered a rollercoaster start to the new Premier League campaign, with three victories, three losses and one draw leaving them languishing in mid-table.",
      "After the club's worst-ever Premier League season in 24/25 - and a summer spree which eclipsed £200million - there were hopes for a quick star to ease pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Victories against Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland have been overshadowed by disappointing losses to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, alongside a stalemate at Fulham.",
      "With the second international interval of the campaign now here, chief Manchester United writer David McDonnell examines how United's squad have performed so far..",
      "Altay Bayindir 6: Didn't cover himself in glory in the defeats to Arsenal and Burnley, but looked much better in the defeat to Brentford. Now appears to have lost his place.",
      "Senne Lammens 8: Delivered a composed first appearance in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last weekend and looks likely to retain his position ahead of Bayindir moving forwards.",
      "Controlled his area, comfortable with both feet, reasonable ball distribution and appears to be a dependable choice between the sticks.",
      "Luke Shaw 6: Has experienced an up and down start to the season. Criticised by Roy Keane for \"stealing a living\" after a below-par showing in the 3-0 derby thrashing at Manchester City, was outstanding versus Chelsea, disappointing once more at Brentford and improved against Sunderland. Needs to find some consistency.",
      "Harry Maguire 6: Like Shaw, he's had a mixed start to the season. Despite a solid performance in the victory over Chelsea, he was at fault for Brentford's first goal in United's 3-1 defeat and was subsequently benched for the Sunderland win. He's struggling to secure a spot in United's preferred back three.",
      "Matthijs De Ligt 8: The most reliable defender for United this season, and has played every minute of the season so far. Whether centrally or on the right of a back three, De Ligt's defensive prowess and positional awareness have been standout features.",
      "Leny Yoro 7: He's carved out a role as United's top choice on the right of a back three, so it's baffling why he started the matches against Chelsea and Brentford on the bench, only to be brought back for Sunderland. He remains cool under pressure and skilled with the ball.",
      "Diogo Dalot 6: Kicked off the season at right wing-back and set up Mbeumo's goal in the Burnley win, but an injury saw him miss the City and Chelsea matches. He returned to the starting line-up at Brentford, where two of their three goals came from his side. Too inconsistent.",
      "Patrick Dorgu 5: Despite starting five of United's seven league games, he's yet to prove himself as a left wing-back. His final delivery needs work and despite having more touches in the opposition box (12) than any other player in the Manchester derby, he failed to capitalise on them.",
      "Noussair Mazraou 6: Currently on the injury list and has only managed two Premier League starts. United are certainly feeling the absence of his physical presence and ball-playing skills from the back.",
      "Ayden Heaven 5: Limited to a mere three minutes in the Premier League and 64 minutes in the EFL Cup exit at Grimsby. Struggling for game time with a lack of fixtures.",
      "Casemiro 6: His reckless fouls resulted in a red card just before half-time in the victory over Chelsea, cancelling out United's one-man advantage after Robert Sanchez's early dismissal. Amorim's lack of faith in Mainoo and Ugarte has seen him get the nod, but his recklessness in challenges is worrying.",
      "Bruno Fernandes 6: He hasn't looked comfortable or effective being deployed in a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, rather than his preferred advanced position, where he can have a greater impact on the attack. Missed two of his last three penalties for United.",
      "Mason Mount 7: After two seasons plagued by injuries, could this be the year Mount finally stays fit and justifies his £55m transfer fee? Scored a stunning opener in the win over Sunderland and received a standing ovation when subbed, following his impressive performance. Needs to stay injury-free.",
      "Manuel Ugarte 4: Bafflingly started the Manchester derby ahead of Casemiro and was too easy for City to play through, offering no protection for the defence. It was a similar story at Brentford. Hard to see him staying beyond this season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo 5: Yet to make a Premier League start this season, his loan request was turned down by United. It's tough to assess a player with such limited game time. His heavy touch led to Brentford's third goal after he was subbed on.",
      "Matheus Cunha 6: His start at United has been slower than anticipated following his £65m transfer from Wolves. After an injury in the Burnley victory, he returned at Brentford, where his cross to Mbeumo earned a penalty that Fernandes missed. With Mount back fit, Cunha's spot is now under threat.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo 8: The standout signing for United this summer. He's made an immediate impact after his £71m move from Brentford. His two goals and one assist don't fully reflect his overall contribution, as his speed and diagonal runs behind enemy lines have added a new element to United's attack.",
      "Benjamin Sesko 7: It's taken him some time to find his feet, but his two goals in the last two matches suggest he's getting there. United are playing to Sesko's strengths, using long balls for the imposing striker to flick on for his teammates, while his poacher's instincts have resulted in his goals.",
      "Amad 6: Has found it difficult to replicate his impressive form from last season and missed the Brentford loss due to a family bereavement. Signs of a return to form were seen in the Sunderland victory, where he came close to scoring.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee 5: The Dutch forward's chances were always going to be limited with the triple signing of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, resulting in him only making three substitute appearances in the league.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is reportedly considering his future at Manchester United ahead of January. The forward arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, when former manager Erik ten Hag was at the club, from Bologna in a transfer worth up to £36.8million (€42.5million).",
      "Zirkzee has netted seven goals in 53 outings for the Red Devils, although he's yet to score this campaign. Ruben Amorim has not given the Netherlands international a single start for United this season - with his three Premier League appearances and one Carabao Cup outing all coming from the bench.",
      "Consequently, it's suggested that Zirkzee is 'reconsidering his future' at the club. The Daily Mail have reported that Zirkzee is mulling over a departure from United during the January transfer window, having grown 'frustrated' with his limited role in the matchday squad this season.",
      "The report suggests that Zirkzee is eager to secure his place in the Netherlands squad for this summer's World Cup and, therefore, is exploring a move away from United in January to maximise his chances of selection.",
      "Juventus and PSV Eindhoven are cited both in the report as having previously shown interest during the summer window, although it's unclear whether either club could be a potential destination from the New Year. Napoli also reportedly had an interest before turning their attention to signing Hojlund instead.",
      "United approved the departures of Marcus Rashford, Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho during the summer transfer window as they overhauled their attacking options. Whether Zirkzee will part ways with United in January or reclaim his spot in the starting XI before the New Year remains to be seen.",
      "Despite being brought on board as a striker, Zirkzee frequently stepped into the No. 10 role last season following Amorim's arrival as head coach. However, the additions of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the squad, coupled with Mason Mount's impressive form, has seen Zirkzee tumble down the pecking order.",
      "United's next match will see them travel to face bitter rivals Liverpool in the Premier League, on October 19, after the international break and it remains to be seen if Zirkzee will get any minutes, or a start, in the fixture at Anfield.",

      "The 22-year-old would have undoubtedly felt the weight of expectation after his hefty transfer from RB Leipzig, especially given the added scrutiny due to issues plaguing his fellow strikers. Sesko emerged as the latest star to grace the Theatre of Dreams, rejecting Newcastle United for a whopping £74million deal in the summer transfer window.",
      "United managed to clinch the deal for Sesko, putting an end to the protracted transfer saga that saw Arsenal as the initial favourites. Both Amorim and Eddie Howe's teams were locked in a fierce battle to bring him to the Premier League.",
      "United's recruitment strategy has faced criticism in recent years, following a series of unsuccessful transfers accompanied by staggering financial expenditure. Sesko's arrival paved the way for Ramus Hojlund's loan move to Napoli, as part of their plan to bolster their attacking prowess, following a disappointing goal tally from their forwards, last season.",
      "However, early indications suggest that Sesko is a hit, earning accolades from figures across the region, including United legend Wayne Rooney.",
      "The former striker believes that the Slovenian not only poses a threat in attack but also enhances the performance of those around him.",
      "\"I think he's a handful, and he uses his body well,\" said the former England captain.",
      "\"He challenges for balls, and it makes it easier for Mbeumo, Cunha when he's on, or Mount to make runs in behind him. So I think that's clearly something they've worked on.",
      "\"And obviously getting another goal, I think, will help him. So, I think for all the players, the win was massive. The manager, the win was massive and much needed.",

Because the people in England are quite ruthless. And I'm very happy for him that this pressure has at least fallen off his shoulders a little.",

      "Harry Maguire's retrial in Greece has been postponed for the fourth time with the Manchester United star now having to wait until March next year to clear his name.",
      "It has been more than five years since the England defender was arrested on the Greek island of Mykonos. The much-delayed hearing was due to begin in Syros on Wednesday morning and Maguire’s defence team were in court ready to defend the Englishman. However the wait will go on and extend into next year.",
      "A possibility exist that Maguire's case will never come to trial at all because the statute of limitations in Greece takes effect after eight years, which would be in August 2028, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire was arrested in the summer of 2020 following an altercation on a family holiday and convicted of assaulting a police officer and attempted bribery. He was handed a 21-month suspended sentence, but the conviction was automatically quashed on appeal under Greek law.",
      "The 32-year-old does not have a criminal record as his original conviction was 'nullified'. He insists he is innocent.",
      "Maguire did not have to attend the trial in person. The first delay came back in May 2023 because his defence counsel was unavailable. Later in in February 2024 it was put back due to the Greek lawyers’ strike and then again in March of this year it was delayed.",
      "The defender was originally found guilty of repeated bodily harm, attempted bribery, violence against public employees and insult. His brother Joe, 33, and pal Christopher Sharman, 34, were accused of clashing with rival fans and police outside a nightclub. Joe Maguire and Sharman got a 13-month suspended sentence. All three deny the charges.",
      "A source close to the United star previously said: “Harry is frustrated this is continuing to drag on after more than five years. Whist he remains determined and confident that he will clear his name, he remains bemused his fundamental defence rights have not begun to be addressed.”",
      "In an interview about the incident following his return to the UK in 2020, Maguire said: “Some people will believe me, some people won't. But one thing I would say about Mykonos is that I have no regrets. My conscience is so clear about what happened that night.\"",
      "Maguire has continued to focus on his football and remains a crucial part of the squad in Manchester. He's currently enjoying some downtime during the international break with his England snub continuing. He's not played for the Three Lions for 13 months.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The 28-year-old has enjoyed huge improvement in recent years and has become one of the most effective strikers in the Premier League, leading the line for an upwardly mobile Eagles outfit. Mateta has won the FA Cup and the Community Shield in recent months, with those exploits earning him a France call-up.",
      "Mateta moved to Selhurst Park as an unknown quantity from Mainz in 2022 and, after a slow start, has hit his straps in recent years under Oliver Glasner. The Frenchman scored 17 goals in all competitions last term - which came after he'd score 19 the year prior to that.",
      "Palace have seen some of their major names - the likes of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze - move on in more recent years when big clubs came calling. Mateta is now rubbing shoulders with some major names in the Les Blues set-up and insists he wants to go as far as he can in his career.",
      "He was asked whether he would like to 'move up a gear' to join an elite club and told RMC Sport: \"It's natural, every ambitious player wants to reach that milestone.",
      "\"Especially when you arrive in the national team and around you, there are only players who play in the Champions League, who win the biggest trophies. When you play surrounded by the best players in the world, naturally you want to reach that milestone.\"",
      "Mateta has already scored four times this season for a Palace team that are flying high in the Premier League. They only tasted defeat for the first time at the weekend and the Frenchman has become one of their key figures ahead of a season in the Europa Conference League, where lifting the trophy could open up evem more possibilities.",
      "Manchester United were previously urged to sign Mateta before they settled on Benjamin Sesko in the summer. They spent more than £70m to land the Slovenian but Sam Allardyce insists the Palace No 14 would've been ideal for them.",
      "He said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast: \"Do you know who I’d have bought, more than anybody else? Mateta, absolutely. The centre-forward is absolutely brilliant and why they didn’t buy him, I don’t know, especially when the big strikers are coming back [into fashion].\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has become football’s first-ever billionaire after signing a blockbuster new contract in Saudi Arabia. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star completed a stunning move to the Middle East in 2013.",
      "After leaving Old Trafford, Ronaldo penned a record-breaking £173m-per-year deal with Al-Nassr. But he was then handed an even more lucrative contract after agreeing to fresh terms in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The 40-year-old is now set to bank around £492m over the next two years - with that amount having seen him surpass the billion pound mark. According to Bloomberg, Ronaldo’s net worth has now risen to $1.4billion (£1.045bn) which sees him become the first-ever footballer to do that..",
      "Some have criticised Ronaldo’s motivation for moving to Saudi Arabia, with it being claimed that it was purely driven by money. But the forward has regularly backed the league, suggesting that it has the potential to surpass some of Europe’s best.",
      "After signing his new contract, he said: \"Of course, we [the Saudi Pro League] are still improving but I believe that in this moment that we are in top five [leagues in the world ] already. I still believe that we will continue to improve, and we have time and we have shown in the last two years that the league is going up all the time.",
      "\"I am happy because I know that the league is very competitive. Only the people who have never played in Saudi, they don't understand nothing about football say this league is not top five [in the world].",
      "\"I believe 100% in my words, and the people that play in this league they know what I am talking about.\"",
      "While he is currently still performing, the question of retirement has regularly been put to the veteran forward. After being given an award in Portugal, Ronaldo said: \"I'll be honest: I don't see it as an obsession.",
      "“If you'd asked me 20 years ago, I might have answered differently, like I wanted to eat the world, but now I don't see things that way. Age also allows us to think differently.",
      "“It's like I said, I have a philosophy of living day by day. In everyday life, things change in a moment. You can't make long-term plans. Right now, I make short-term plans because it gives me more energy that way, more of a desire to live.",
      "“I enjoy each day, training session by training session and competition by competition. Then, down the road, we'll see.\"",
      "Ronaldo has put together a stunning goalscoring record during his time in Saudi Arabia. He has scored 104 goals in 117 appearances in all competitions for Al-Nassr.",

      "Manchester United ace Marcus Rashford's transfer value is on a downward spiral despite enjoying a successful stint at Barcelona so far. After his loan spell at Aston Villa, Rashford expressed his desire to leave United during the summer transfer window.",
      "His wish was granted when an agreement was struck with his preferred club - the Catalan behemoth, Barcelona. Barca agreed to foot the bill for Rashford's wages in full, bringing him to the club on a loan deal.",
      "The La Liga side, managed by Hansi Flick, also have the option to make the England international's move permanent next summer for a fee around £26.2million. Since making his debut, Rashford has hit the ground running, netting three goals and providing five assists in ten appearances - including a double against Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "However, despite his promising start to the season, his transfer value continues to tumble, according to transfer experts. As of last week, Rashford's value is said to stand at a mere £34.72million. The forward hasn't seen his value dip below £43.4million since he was a teenager back in 2017.",
      "Back then, he was valued just over £26million, but his worth would soar within a year. Rashford's transfer value reached its zenith in 2021 when it hit a staggering £73.77million.",
      "Whilst his market worth remains higher than what United could potentially pocket should he make his Barcelona switch permanent at the season's close, the Reds possess limited scope to secure a more lucrative deal.",
      "After completing his loan stint in La Liga, Rashford will still have two years left to run on his Old Trafford contract, and having already made clear his intentions to seek pastures new, United find themselves with precious little leverage to demand a heftier transfer fee.",
      "Barcelona have already made it crystal clear that they're under no compulsion to make Rashford's move permanent should they choose not to. Nevertheless, their sporting director Deco suggested the early indicators are promising for the Wythenshawe-born forward.",
      "\"There's no penalty clause in the loan agreement if we don't sign him,\" he revealed to Mundo Deportivo. \"We do have an option to make it permanent if we want to. It's too early to talk about decisions for next season. What matters is that we're happy with him.\"",
      "While it has been claimed that Barcelona may try to secure Rashford for even less than £26m, Mirror Sport understands they value him much higher and believe the option represents a 'bargain' deal, especially after his eight goal contributions from 10 games.",
      "A Barca source said: \"At the top of his game, Marcus Rashford is one of the best players in Europe. Barca have got themselves a genuine bargain. Marcus should be worth more than £60m in the current market.\"",

      "Amorim secured a much needed win at the weekend, beating Sunderland at Old Trafford, but the Portuguese boss has still not secured back-to-back victories during his 50 Premier League games in charge, underlining how difficult his tenure has been.",
      "His long-term future in Manchester continues to be a talking point, especially with the coach so wedded to his philosophy, which has failed to result in an upturn in form. ESPN reports that CEO Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox have spoken to members of the squad - including captain Bruno Fernandes as well as the leadership group - and they believe support still exists for Amorim.",
      "Conversations were not formal and the individuals were not deliberately 'sounded out' ahead of a decision on Amorim, who has a contract with the club until 2027 and is only just about to mark 12 months in the job.",
      "Mason Mount has said that the dressing room is \"100% behind the gaffer\" despite the early struggles. Defender Matthijs de Ligt also publicly backed Amorim following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford less than a fortnight ago.",
      "Any decision to sack Amorim would involve Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Joel Glazer. Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox would also be asked for their input having been hands-on in the decisions that have been taken by the club. They have been active in trying to understand what the mood is at the club.",
      "Both men are based at the Carrington training base and that has given them a greater insight. It has also allowed them to have constant communication with Amorim and the squad, owing to the communal areas in the new training centre.",
      "The United boss has continued to cut a defiant figure when questioned about his future - and has maintained that his playing style is not the reasons for their struggles.",
      "He said: \"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "Amorim also added: \"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "In goal, there is no reason to change Senne Lammens after the 23-year-old's assured debut against Sunderland, which had United fans chanting “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?” given how well he commanded his area and repelled everything thrown at him.",
      "For his back three, Amorim must go with Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw, just as he did against the Black Cats. Shaw may not have been as impressive as Yoro and De Ligt this season, not least in the defeats to Manchester City and Brentford, but he is the best option on the left side of defence and brings balance to the back three, not to mention experience of hostile atmospheres like Anfield.",
      "Amorim's midfield four at Anfield will surely be Amad on the right, Casemrio and Bruno Fernandes in the middle, with Diogo Dalot operating at left wing-back. Patrick Dorgu started the Sunderland win on the bench, coming for Dalot in the second-half, and there seems little reason for Amorim to change that around, given the latter offers more than the former, offensively and defensively.",
      "United skipper Fernandes may not be at his marauding best in the deeper midfield role to which Amorim has assigned him this season, but he will remain there for the time being and the team will need his energy and omnipresence to achieve some semblance of control against Arne Slot's side, who have suffered three successive defeats and are therefore uncharacteristically vulnerable.",
      "Mason Mount has played his way into the starting line-up, at the expense of Matheus Cunha, following his goal-scoring, all-action display against Sunderland, which offered a timely reminder of his enduring quality and value when he is fully fit, which has been all too rare during his two years at United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will also maintain his record of starting every Premier League game since his £71m move from Brentford, given the immediate impact he has made since joining and the different dimension he brings to the attack, with his pace, physicality and dangerous runs in behind defences.",
      "Up front, 6ft 4in fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko has settled in after a slow start and will be looking for his third goal in as many games against Liverpool. The Slovenia striker has grown into the role of leading United's attack and Amorim will be looking for him to make sure he is a handful for Liverpool's defenders in a game the Reds must now believe they can win.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could get to Halloween without making a Premier League start this season.",
      "Mainoo will be spooked by his current situation. The youngster has knuckled down in an attempt to win back his starting role, but Ruben Amorim continues to overlook him on matchdays.",
      "There has been widespread chatter about Mainoo's predicament. The midfielder scored the matchwinner in the 2024 FA Cup final and started in the Euro 2024 final for England. But just 15 months later, he cannot get a start in the Premier League, so it's not a surprise that fans are talking about the situation.",
      "Mainoo is doing all he can to change Amorim's mind, training with a private coach during the international breaks and even changing his private chef at home in an attempt to improve.",
      "He deserves to be commended for reacting positively to the challenge that he is facing, although it will become increasingly difficult to stay motivated if his situation does not change.",
      "Will Mainoo's situation alter? It looks unlikely. He was an unused substitute for the opening two games of the season and has been limited to a further five substitute appearances since.",
      "Amorim has said Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes for the deeper midfield role - but Fernandes is regarded as undroppable and has kept his place despite underperforming.",
      "There is still more water to go under the bridge before the January transfer window. Yet there is still a chance that Mainoo could force his way into the team and Amorim is praised for coaxing another level from him, however, the evidence from the first few months of the campaign suggest that it is unlikely.",
      "Instead, the indicators suggest Mainoo will ask to leave on loan for a second time when the winter window opens. Whether such a request would be accepted is another matter.",
      "Mainoo is under contract and was told to fight for his place by his manager when he enquired about leaving on loan in the summer, and United may give him a similar answer in January.",
      "The 20-year-old is desperate to play ahead of the World Cup - Mainoo is determined to make the England squad - but United will put the club first and argue he is needed in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim's midfield options are light and Mainoo will be needed if injuries occur, but there will naturally be frustration from the player's perspective, especially in a World Cup campaign.",
      "Fans will likely be sympathetic toward Mainoo, who is one of the biggest academy success stories of the last decade, and some believe he has been unfairly treated by Amorim so far this term.",
      "Amorim had a chance to start Mainoo against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium but preferred Manuel Ugarte, which was true to form after comments about Mainoo competing with Fernandes.",
      "United's head coach does not consider Mainoo as a foil to Fernandes, although that partnership hasn't been given a fair crack of the whip and appeals on paper in fixtures that United want to control.",
      "Amorim is as stubborn as old boots though and probably won't change his opinion on his midfield, which suggests Mainoo will revisit his situation in January with the hope of leaving for regular minutes.",
      "It will reflect badly on Amorim if he cannot make it work. There is something wrong with a manager's system if it cannot accommodate one of the finest young talents in Europe.",
      "Ten Hag described Mainoo as the \"perfect midfielder\". Gareth Southgate said England \"haven't really had a player like him until now\". United academy coaches were huge advocates of Mainoo's talent.",
      "Amorim is the first manager in Mainoo's career to question him, which is bound to be frustrating, but all he can do is continue to work hard and focus on his training at Carrington.",
      "It's fascinating because everyone knows what Mainoo can do, perhaps except Amorim.",

      "United unveiled a £50million makeover to the main building in August and have announced plans to bring academy facilities in line with the 'leading standards' they have for the first-team.",
      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",
      "The modular building is already equipped for an elite team and staff, but it will be further developed for specific academy needs to ensure minimal disruption for the U21s and U18s.",
      "The U21s and U18s have made great starts to the season with the former top of the table and the latter second on goal difference.",
      "United sources have insisted the modular building is not a construction site-style portacabin, while also stressing that it was not possible to develop academy facilities simultaneously alongside the previous work.",
      "The first-team shared the academy building during the 12-month renovation of the main building.",
      "United have said addressing academy facilities was the 'natural step' after investing a combined £60m in the men's first-team building and the women's facility across the last three years.",
      "Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada are 'determined' to improve the academy and make it the best in the world, and have decided the facilities need to be improved to meet this ambition.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Manchester United have endured a typically turbulent start to the new Premier League season, with three wins, three defeats and a draw to sit mid-table.",
      "Wins over Burnley, Chelsea and Sunderland have been undermined by defeats to Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford, as well as a draw at Fulham.",
      "As the second international break of the season is now upon us, here's how United's players have rated so far this season:",
      "Altay Bayindir: At fault for the goal in United's opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford and also culpable for those conceded in the last-gasp 3-2 win over Burnely. Ironically made some decent saves in 3-1 loss at Brentford but always looks like he has a mistake in him. 6",
      "Senne Lammens: Made an assured debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland last weekend and is likely to keep his place ahead of Bayindir going forward. Commanded his box, two-footed, decent distribution and looks to be a solid option between the posts. 8",
      "Luke Shaw: Has had a mixed start to the season. Called out by Roy Keane for “stealing a living” after poor display in 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, was excellent against Chelsea, poor again at Brentford and better against Sunderland. Needs more consistency of performance. 6",
      "Harry Maguire: Like Shaw, he has endured an up and down start to the campaign. Aggressive and solid in the win over Chelsea, was at fault for Brentford's opener in United's 3-1 defeat and benched as a result for the Sunderland win. Struggles to make United's first-choice back three. 6",
      "Matthijs De Ligt: United's most consistent defender this season, evidenced by the fact he has started all seven Premier League games and played every minute. Whether he starts centrally or on the right of a back three, De Ligt's defensive diligence and positional sense has shone through. 8",
      "Leny Yoro: Has established himself as United's best option on the right of a back three, so it remains a mystery as to why he started the games against Chelsea and Brentford on the bench, before being recalled for Sunderland. Calm under pressure and adept in possession. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Started the season at right wing-back and provided an assist for Mbeumo to score in the Burnley win, but injury ruled him out of the City and Chelsea games. Returned to the starting line-up at Brentford, where two of their three goals came down his flank. Too flakey. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Started five of United's seven league games, but has still to convince as a left wing-back. His final ball needs improving and he had more touches in the opposition box (12) than any other player in the Manchester derby, but failed to make any of them count. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Currently injured and has been restricted to two Premier League starts. United have missed his physicality and ball-playing ability out from the back. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Restricted to three minutes in the Premier League and 64 minutes in the EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby. Struggling to get game-time with so few fixtures. 5",
      "Casemiro: Two needless fouls saw him red carded just before half-time in the win over Chelsea, negating United's one-man advantage after Robert Sanchez's early dismissal. Amorim's lack of trust in Mainoo and Ugarte has seen him get the nod, but recklessness in challenges is a concern. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Has not looked happy, comfortable or effective being deployed in a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, rather than his more favoured advanced position, where he can wield greater attacking influence. Missed two of his last three penalties for United. 6",
      "Mason Mount: After two injury-blighted seasons at United, is this the year Mount finally stays fit and justifies his £55m transfer fee? Scored a sublime opener in the win over Sunderland and received a standing ovation when subbed, following his impressive display. Has to avoid injury. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Inexplicably started the Manchester derby ahead of Casemiro and was too easy for City to play through, providing no protection for the defence. It was a similar story at Brentford. Hard to see him staying beyond this season. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Has yet to start a Premier League game this season and saw his request to go out on loan rejected by United. Hard to make a judgment on a player who has had so few minutes. Gave the ball away for Brentford's third goal with a heavy touch after coming off the bench. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: A slower than expected start to his United career following his £65m move from Wolves. Injured in the win over Burnley, he returned at Brentford, with his cross to Mbeumo winning a penalty missed by Fernandes. Cunha's place now under threat from a fit-again Mount. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: United's stand-out summer signing. Has hit the ground running following his £71m move from Brentford. Two goals and an assist do not do justice to his overall contribution, his pace and diagonal runs in behind opposition defences giving United's attack a new dimension. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Has taken his time to settle, but two goals in his last two games shows he is getting there. United are playing to 6ft 4in Sesko's strengths, with long balls for him to flick-on for his fellow attackers, while his poacher's instincts from close-range have yielded his goals. 7",
      "Amad: Has struggled to reproduce his impressive form of last season and missed the defeat at Brentford due to a family bereavement. Glimpses of a return to his best came in the win over Sunderland, where he came close to scoring. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: The triple arrival of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko was always going to limit his opportunities, with the Dutch forward restricted to three sub appearances in the league. 5",

      "Good morning and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, October 8.",
      "We might only be in the midst of the second international break of the season, but build-up towards the January transfer window is well underway. Joshua Zirkzee appears to be the latest player looking towards the exit door at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dutchman has been used sparingly this season by Ruben Amorim and it's believed that Zirkzee wants to try his hand elsewhere. Marcus Rashford has remained a trending topic after his bright start to life at Barcelona with a second consecutive England call-up handed to him.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains of interest to United with the midfielder in action alongside new signing Bryan Mbeumo and outcast Andre Onana.",
      "As always, we will keep you across any other major United developments throughout the day right here.",
      "Take a look at the latest Manchester United updates below...",
      "Manchester United look set to appoint Brentford’s chief operating officer, Ameesh Manek, as the club's new director of football operations.",
      "The BBC claims the Bees chief has agreed to take on the director of football operations position and that staff at both clubs were informed of the appointment earlier today.",
      "Manek is set to move north and his job will be to oversee the running of United's Carrington training ground.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, when speaking on The Times' 'The Business' Podcast, issued a clear Ruben Amorim verdict after a challenging start to the season for Manchester United",
      "He has not had the best of seasons. Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.",
      "“It’s not going to happen [Amorim be sacked if the Glazers told him to].”",
      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has offered a verdict on Ruben Amorim's stubbornness to continue playing a back five.",
      "Amorim has persisted with his methods of using wing-backs and a midfield pivot despite often being tactically undone and overrun. Meulensteen has now provided his verdict on the topic with sack pressure on Amorim only easing after a recent 2-0 win against Sunderland.",
      "No system is the problem in football. The question to ask is whether the players you have can apply it correctly. And if they can't, you have to adapt. The problem is that he keeps trying the same things and nothing changes.",
      "Ruben Amorim looks set for a huge Manchester United injury boost after the international break with Lisandro Martinez set to return to training, for according to the Mail.",
      "Their report has stated that a positive scan result on his knee means he is ready \"to step up to the final stage of his rehabilitation\".",
      "The Argentine has missed the last eight months with a serious knee injury but appears on target to make a return this month after resuming light training back in July.",
      "Despite only having 15 minutes on the pitch after replacing Carlos Baleba, Bryan Mbeumo made one hell of an impact for Ghana on international duty.",
      "With the score against Mauritius at 1-0, Mbeumo's run into the box was picked out by Christian Bassogog and while his first effort was saved, Mbeumo was on hand to tuck home the rebound and make it 2-0.",
      "That is now five goal contributions for the 26-year-old since his move from Brentford with Ruben Amorim likely delighted he has not played a full 90 minutes but has still found the back of the net.",
      "Romano was also on hand to issue a clear update on the future of Bruno Fernandes after reports emerged suggesting he had agreed to move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Portugal international was of firm interest to Al-Nassr but opted to stay at Old Trafford. Interest from the Middle East in acquiring his services has remained, however.",
      "Nothing at all at the moment. Full focus on United, new deal was signed one year ago, so nothing concrete at this stage. Saudis remain interested as they've been for the last three years but nothing else now.",
      "Carlos Baleba has been joined by Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton as midfielders being linked to Manchester United.",
      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, via GiveMeSport, has shed some light on the club's potential plans for the upcoming January window.",
      "There’s a possibility of Man United going for a midfielder in January but it depends on opportunities. Unless there is a big name it is likey to be a window of a loan deal or last minute chance on the market.",
      "Carlos Baleba is one of three players currently in action likely of interest to Manchester United.",
      "Late into the summer window, enquiries for made to understand conditions of a potential deal but nothing materialised. Baleba has not completed a game this season with his withdrawal at half-time in last Sunday's draw against Wolves the third time he has been taken off at the interval.",
      "In action for Cameroon against Mauritius, he made it to 75 minutes before being replaced by United attacker Bryan Mbeumo. It is very likely that Ruben Amorim will be glad to see him not playing the full game but also keeping some match sharpness.",
      "United loannee Andre Onana played the entirety of the match but only had one save to make. Two of his appearances for Trabzonspor have been very different to that with a total of 15 saves made. He has also picked up an assist since joining.",
      "Manchester United have announced the academy building at Carrington will be redeveloped.",
      "United unveiled a £50million makeover to the main building in August and have announced plans to bring academy facilities in line with the 'leading standards' they have for the first-team.",
      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United talent Shea Lacey has joined the England senior team for training at St George's Park ahead of Thursday's friendly against Wales at Wembley.",
      "The attacking midfielder was named in the Under 20s group for the first time, after an impressive start to the 2025/26 campaign with United.",
      "However, he was one of three players promoted into manager Thomas Tuchel's senior session, with Lakyle Samuel and Harrison Murray-Campbell the others linking up with the squad.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is still attracting interest from Napoli and could make the move to the Serie A side in January.",
      "\"In advanced discussions with Manchester United at the very end of the summer transfer window, Napoli are maintaining contact with Kobbie Mainoo's entourage,\" Tavolieri said. \"What's more, the Partenopei are reportedly in pole position to land the promising English midfielder.",
      "\"A loan move is being considered as early as the January transfer window to give him more playing time and continue his development in a competitive environment. The Italian club hopes to conclude this deal quickly.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's future has become the subject of speculation as a move away from Manchester United is reportedly on the cards.",
      "Reports have claimed that Zirkzee may consider an Old trafford exit when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United has been the subject of speculation for several weeks, and now a fresh update has emerged.",
      "A report has claimed that United chiefs have held talks with members of the squad to determine if there is still support within the group for Amorim.",
      "Even though Marcus Rashford is enjoying life in Barcelona, the Manchester United star has seen his transfer value drop this season.",
      "Rashford left United to join Barca on loan for the season, and has already scored three goals and provided five assists at the Camp Nou.",
      "However, that form has not been enough to prevent Rashford's market value from falling this season.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Maguire is open to remaining at United beyond the end of his current contract which expires this summer.",
      "However, if he is to stay at Old Trafford, it is thought that he will need to accept a pay cut.",
      "Maguire has started just two Premier League matches this season - the win against Chelsea and the defeat over Brentford.",
      "One option United could look at to replace Zirkzee is Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Juventus man is being pushed out of Turin and is expected to leave no matter what next summer.",
      "United have been linked with him before but their hopes of signing him this time around could be slim as Bayern Munich are thought to be keen on the centre-forward and Vlahovic is believed to be open to the move.",
      "Napoli were keen on Zirkzee in the summer but signed Hojlund instead so they are likely to be out of the race this time around.",
      "The Mail understands Juventus and PSV Eindhoven hold an interest in Zirkzee and both would provide the Netherlands international with opportunities to play.",
      "However, the Reds would need to sign a replacement to allow Zirkzee to leave.",
      "That's according to the Daily Mail who claim that Zirkzee wants to leave United at the soonest opportunity.",
      "It is believed the forward is frustrated by his lack of minutes so far this season following the arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Zirkzee is keen to ensure a move is completed in January so as to boost his chances of making the World Cup squad.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog!",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the latest United news in this opening few hours of the morning.",
      "To bring you up to speed, here's what you may have missed yesterday."

      "Amorim has endured a nightmare first year in charge of United and has twice offered to resign if Ratcliffe and the rest of the hierarchy felt it was in the best interests of the club.",
      "But United co-owner Ratcliffe, in control of football operations at the club, hailed the 40-year-old head coach as a “good guy” who deserved to be judged over the length of his three-year deal.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” said Ratcliffe. “Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",

      "But the mood in the camp has certainly been lifted on the back of the weekend win as players head away on international football. Yet for a couple of United stars, this week offers a reminder of the uncertain future they face ahead of a potential January transfer decision.",
      "Amorim dropped Altay Bayindir for the win over Sunderland, with replacement Senne Lammens impressing and keeping a clean sheet on debut. The Belgian now looks set to retain his spot as first choice keeper and plunge Bayindir into the wilderness.",
      "The absence of European football and an early exit from the Carabao Cup mean there are far fewer opportunities for rotation at Old Trafford this term and Bayindir could see his match minutes limited.",
      "That may have a knock on effect on his international ambitions with Turkey, who are seeking a spot in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Bayindir is one of four keepers named in Vincenzo Montella's squad for this month's internationals but the prospect of barely playing for United over the coming months would impact his chances of keeping his spot, or challenging to be the starting stopper in North America next summer.",
      "It's a similar picture for Netherlands forward Joshua Zirkzee, who has yet to start for United in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old is behind Benjamin Sesko in the central striking pecking order and has intense competition to play as a number 10. It means Zirkzee could be set for a season on the fringes at Old Trafford and as such the frontman might assess his options come the January transfer window.",
      "Reports have already emerged suggesting the former Bologna striker might look for an exit route when the winter window opens, while Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has again overlooked the United man for his squad this month, having issued a brutal verdict earlier this year.",
      "Speaking in March, Koeman said: \"He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment. In particular, scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong. Yes, in principle, form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "\"We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front. But even then, I still think that you have to earn your selection, and I think he doesn’t deserve that now, but that could be the case again in another period.\"",
      "That Koeman verdict came amid a campaign where Zirkzee played 53 matches for club and country, the drop in game time since then is unlikely to convince the Dutch chief to change his thinking.",
      "It means Zirkzee, along with Bayindir, face a World Cup dilemma ahead of the January transfer window.",

      "Manchester United have received a Bryan Mbeumo boost during the October international break.",
      "The Cameroonian arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford this summer for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons. The forward, who scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season, has made a positive start to life under Ruben Amorim with two goals and an assist so far across all competitions.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular in the league, having played 90 minutes in all but one fixture so far in 2024/25. The 26-year-old is currently away on international duty with Cameroon, where he has continued his fine form.",
      "The ex-Troyes star came off the bench to score against Mauritius in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Mbeumo only played 13 minutes in his country's 2-0 victory, with Reds goalkeeper Andre Onana, currently on loan at Trabzonspor, keeping a clean sheet.",
      "News of Mbeumo's goal and his limited minutes will be music to Amorim's ears. Having one of his few good performers not being overly exerted can only be a positive for United's under-fire head coach, while the fact Mbeumo got on the scoresheet in his short stint on the pitch is a bonus for his confidence too.",
      "Amorim will now be hoping that one of his star attackers comes through unscathed in Cameroon's next match - a clash at home to Angola on Monday. United will want Mbeumo to return fit and healthy for the Premier League clash with Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday, October 19.",
      "However, whatever happens during this international break, United will know that Mbeumo is almost certain to be involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins in late December.",
      "Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are also set to participate in the tournament, which runs from December 21 to January 18.",
      "Mbeumo has recently argued that Amorim's controversial 3-4-2-1 formation at United is not to blame for the team’s problems as they continue to struggle under the Portuguese.",
      "The Reds earned a much-needed 2-0 win at home to Sunderland before the international break, but currently sit 10th in the top-flight and were knocked out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town.",

      "Manchester United have been told why Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is unlikely to replace Ruben Amorim in the event that a managerial change is made.",
      "Amorim's future as United head coach has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, after a run of disappointing results in the first couple of months of the season. The Reds went into the international break on a positive note, though, with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland in the Premier League.",
      "Rumours about Amorim's future have led to speculation about a potential replacement being lined up, with several names reportedly being considered. Oliver Glasner of Crystal Palace, Fabian Hurzeler of Brighton and Andoni Iraola of Bournemouth have all been linked with the manager's job at Old Trafford in some capacity - while Howe has also been tipped a potential replacement.",
      "However, former Newcastle United midfielder Jeff Hendrick believes that United are likely to stick with Amorim for at least another transfer window. Hendrick also explained why he does not expect Howe to take the job if the opportunity arises.",
      "\"I would be so surprised if the Manchester United job came available and Eddie Howe took it. I think it's a really, really tough job to take now,\" said Hendrick in an interview with Boyle Sports.",
      "\"They're kind of stuck. You look at Ruben Amorim coming in, and he had a good profile of what he'd done previously, but he looks disheartened.",
      "\"He looks disheartened even though he's had a summer to get a couple of signings in. I think they're better off maybe sticking with him for another transfer window, but who knows if they will.",
      "\"Touching on Eddie Howe, he's got the run of the club at Newcastle now with how well he's done. He's able to bring in the players he wants, and let go of the players he doesn't want.",
      "\"The fans love him. I don't see why he'd leave. I think for him, his target is to consistently hit Champions League football with that club.\"",

      "Manek is set to move north and his job will be to oversee the running of United's Carrington training ground.",
      "The report says the incoming chief will also be in charge of 'travel, security, the training facilities and staff management and infrastructure.'",
      "He's set to become the latest arrival following a number of leadership appointments, including Omar Berrada's arrival from Manchester City, Jason Wilcox as technical director, and Marc Armstrong as the club's chief business officer.",
      "Interestingly, the role of director of football operations was previously made redundant by United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, with David Harrison operating in that role from 2023 until 2025.",
      "Harrison was made redundant earlier this year and was one of the most high profile departures from Ratcliffe's cost cutting measures.",
      "Manek will now step into that role, after spending three-years with the Bees. He first joined the club as business operations director before being promoted to the role of chief operating officer in July 2024.",
      "Prior to his spell at Brentford, Manek spent five-years at Arsenal, working his way up to head of first team football operations.",
      "His previous role at the Bees was reportedly more administrative, but the move to United will have 'a larger focus on football matters for both the men's and women's teams.'"

      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years because followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Former United star Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Isaac Romero doubled the home side's lead. Rashford's impressive strike then came in first-half injury time.",

      "\"I don't want to talk about the two goals, we don't want excuses. We have to focus on the first half, but the most important thing is the reaction. This defeat is important and after the break we will fight for all the titles. That's what we want, we are a good team.\"",

      "Manchester United secured their third Premier League win of the season on Saturday as they beat Sunderland 2-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "The visitors started strongly but United soon took control of the game and Mason Mount produced an excellent finish to put Ruben Amorim’s side ahead.",
      "Benjamin Sesko made it 2-0 shortly after the half hour mark as he grabbed his second goal in a week.",
      "Sunderland were awarded a penalty before the half-time break but the decision was overturned by referee Stuart Attwell after he’d been advised by VAR to head over to the pitchside monitor.",
      "United held strong in the second half to see out the win.",
      "Here’s all the reaction from today’s game:",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Read the full ratings here.",

      "VAR is checking for a Sunderland penalty.",
      "Lammens hasn't had much to do this afternoon, but he just made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Xhaka.",
      "All the talk was about Amorim's future after Brentford and this has been a great response.",
      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",
      "Sesko with a second goal in the space of a week - and it's a good finish.",
      "He celebrated with a huge leap in front of the Stretford End.",
      "United have turned on the style in the first half an hour of this make or break game for Amorim and would be three or four up were it not for the brilliance of Sunderland keeper Robin Roefs in denying Mbeumo, Amad and Fernandes.",
      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",
      "Amorim cannot believe United haven't extended their advantage. Roefs did brilliantly to deny Fernandes' effort and Amad headed the follow up wide of the post.",
      "United were 2-0 down within 20 minutes last weekend and this has already been much better.",
      "\"We heard you singing when Sergio scored,\" sing the Sunderland fans at Old Trafford.",
      "Think they probably need a new chant after all these years...",
      "Superb finish from Mount to give United the lead. Mount took down Mbeumo’s ball with a fine first touch with his left foot and then produced a clinical finish with his right to put the home side ahead. There was no emotion fron Amorim on the touchline, just a thumbs up to his coaching staff.",
      "What a brilliant goal from Mount, who finds the bottom right with an excellent finish.",
      "Mbeumo found Mount in the box but he still had plenty to do to score.",
      "Sunderland should have the ball in the net - but the move was eventually flagged offside.",
      "This is a huge chance for Sunderland to claim a win at Old Trafford, something they last did in May 2014 when Giggs was the interim manager. Sunderland's fans are in fine voice and are clearly well up for this.",

      "How often have we seen striker's come to Manchester United with plenty of fanfare and then fail to live up to the hype?",
      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has opened up on the future of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and his relationship with the Glazer family.",
      "Ratcliffe holds a 28.94 per cent stake in United having taken control of football operations in February 2024.",
      "The British billionaire has made a helluva lot of mistakes at the helm and has been roundly criticised for his cot-cutting measures, including cutting jobs and ending free lunches for staff in a bid to put United on a “firm financial footing”.",
      "“The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe told The Business podcast. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.",
      "“There are two halves to a football team – there is the business side and the sports side. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor – is profitability.",
      "READ: Nine middle-aged gammons slam ‘wh*re’ Gary Neville as ‘champagne socialist’ is reminded he’s white too",
      "“The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build. It’s like a Formula One car – the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be.",
      "“So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "“If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We’re not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we’ve done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "“Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "The Glazers, who took control of United in 2005, have been blamed by the fans for United’s demise since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013, but Ratcliffe insisted “they get a bad rap… but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”",
      "Amorim’s most significant on-pitch decision was to sack Erik ten Hag last November and replace him with Ruben Amorim, who has won just 37 points in 34 games and has been under pressure of the sack pretty much since he arrived at the club.",
      "Having insisted the Glazers asking him to sack Amorim “isn’t going to happen”, Ratcliffe said he won’t make decisions based on “some journalist who goes off on one”.",
      "He added: “The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed Amorim is “a good guy”, before implying he’s set to lead United for a long time yet.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” he admitted. “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.”",
      "Ruben Amorim being sacked by Manchester United is justified by three factors that potentially set up a relegation battle for the Premier League giants…",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",

      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "The conventional wisdom is that international breaks spell bad news for under-pressure managers. If the trigger fingers of Premier League executives only become itchier the longer they are given to contemplate such decisions, that week or so when players are sent around the world to represent their countries can be the most dangerous time for struggling coaches. It used to give Steve Bruce sleepless nights.",
      "That vibe feels particularly relevant for Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim at Nottingham Forest and Manchester United, while Vitor Pereira might not be too eager to check his work emails before Wolves reconvene.",
      "But are international breaks really that perilous for a Premier League manager? And what is it about them which makes chairmen desperate to get hold of a particular Italian’s number? Sir Jim Ratcliffe might try and drag Claudio Ranieri out of retirement soon.",
      "",
      "“We are going to speak because there are things to address,” said Nuno Espirito Santo of a “shocking” performance against West Ham which “didn’t help things” when it came to his upcoming showdown talks with owner Evangelos Marinakis.",
      "There has since been a suggestion those talks never even took place, that Marinakis was so incensed with Nuno going public on the breakdown of their relationship and issues with new Global Head of Football Edu that the irascible Greek had made his mind up regardless.",
      "How well has it gone? Well Nuno soon found employment at West Ham and his replacement, Ange Postecoglou, is the favourite in the Premier League sack race after starting with seven winless games. So not very well.",
      "",
      "The only surprise was that it took so long. Conte spent his final press conference as Spurs manager systematically dismantling any bridges back to north London and indeed very possibly the Premier League itself to such an extent that Daniel Levy needed a week to properly digest the tongue-lashing.",
      "The chairman eventually responded with a 111-word statement pretending the Italian’s exit was in any way ‘mutual’, delivered an hour or so after England dispatched Ukraine in Euro 2024 qualifying with an opening goal from Harry Kane.",
      "The Spurs striker had quite inevitably scored in the draw with Southampton which triggered Conte’s last, exit-inducing outburst, the captain being rendered collateral damage like everyone else.",
      "It did not exactly come out of nowhere. Conte, as is his eternal legal obligation, had been growing increasingly tetchy over previous weeks. Spurs remained in a theoretical race for Champions League qualification but they limped out of the same competition to AC Milan in the last 16 and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Sheffield United in the build-up to the Southampton game.",
      "They led 3-1 at St Mary’s by the 76th minute but drew after a stunning collapse culminated in James Ward-Prowse scoring a stoppage-time penalty. Their form was disastrous, the relationship was broken and the international break offered a chance to reset.",
      "It also provided an opportunity to appoint Conte’s assistant as his replacement; Cristian Stellini lasted four games as interim manager before himself being shown the door following a 6-1 defeat at Newcastle. But at least he managed to leave without offering every past, present and future club employee outside.",
      "READ NEXT: The best bits of the inside stories about Conte leaving Spurs, from bored players to an angry academy",
      "",
      "In the antepenultimate post of a glittering managerial career, Ranieri’s 16-week, 14-game reign at Vicarage Road was an all-timer for ridiculousness.",
      "They failed to keep a clean sheet and conceded four goals or more in four games. The Italian’s first match against Liverpool was very possibly the single worst team performance ever committed to Premier League history. His last game was a 3-0 defeat to Norwich.",
      "But his two wins were remarkable: 5-2 against Everton and 4-1 against Man Utd to maintain at least mathematical hope of a survival which was never realistically going to be achieved.",
      "Ranieri was, at the very least, more popular than his successor – and possibly even his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Not 24 hours after a 1-0 defeat to Leeds described by goalkeeper and captain Ben Foster as “a battering”, Watford dispensed with Munoz 10 months into his reign after sensing “a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving”.",
      "The Hornets were 14th with seven points from as many games, having beaten Aston Villa; how many managers would they would sack to return to such “a negative trend” four years later?",
      "More. The answer is always more.",
      "Munoz’s longest coaching stint ever remains the 41 games he managed with Slovakian top-flight side Dunajska Streda, with spells at Huesca, Anorthosis, Sheffield Wednesday and ohor Darul Ta’zim hardly suggesting Watford made a glaring error in parting with the manager who had secured automatic promotion so recently.",
      "Ranieri was soon installed, himself only lasting until January before handing over to Roy Hodgson, who barely muddled through until May as Watford suffered a Premier League relegation from which they are yet to recover.",
      "",
      "One of the precious few Premier League managers to be sacked after winning their final game, Farke’s fate was sealed long before Norwich earned their first victory of the season 11 games in. A matter of minutes after conducting post-match media duties having beaten Brentford, the Canaries told the manager that he would be left in the coalmine.",
      "The decision to part with Farke had apparently been made on the morning of the game, regardless of the result. Norwich were bottom after a run of two draws, three goals scored and eight defeats in their first ten matches; they remained rooted to the foot of the table even after the Brentford win.",
      "But the timing was curious. While the international break was an in-built momentum killer anyway, Norwich seemed desperate to crush even the pretence of an hour’s worth of overdue positivity.",
      "It took them another nine days to unsuccessfully pursue Frank Lampard and bring in Dean Smith, who won his first game but only three of the subsequent 26 as Norwich finished precisely where they were when Farke was forced out.",
      "",
      "Norwich’s delay can be explained at least in part by the fact the manager they eventually settled on was busy himself being sacked in the interim.",
      "Smith was regrettably shown the Aston Villa door after five consecutive defeats, the last of which came against Southampton. He remains the only manager to face the same opponent in consecutive Premier League games in the same season, but with different clubs; Norwich beat Saints a fortnight later and Smith went on to force three separate sackings later in the campaign.",
      "It was an undoubted gamble on Villa’s part and many felt Smith had been dealt with harshly, particularly considering Jack Grealish had been sold the summer before. But it seemed as though they nailed the call when Steven Gerrard was brought in from Rangers and immediately oversaw an improvement in results and performances.",
      "Those wheels soon came off and Gerrard did not last a year. In all fairness to Villa, they did alright with their next appointment.",
      "",
      "Levy tends to let things stew before bringing them to the boil. In the official statement announcing a parting of the ways with Pochettino after five-and-a-half years together, the chairman said “it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste”.",
      "More than a week after Spurs broke up for international duty following a 1-1 home draw with Sheffield United, the speculation had been that Pochettino faced a ‘make-or-break’ meeting with West Ham on their return. That was instead the dug-out debut of Jose Mourinho in a thrilling win which teased a generational manager-player link-up with Dele.",
      "",
      "The law of averages dictate that most international break Premier League manager sackings would have been meted out by Watford. The proof is in the P45-based pudding served to a succession of coaches at Vicarage Road.",
      "Gracia had taken the Hornets to an 11th-placed finish and the FA Cup final in 2019, but there was a falsity about those seemingly strong foundations: Watford ended the Premier League season losing seven of their last 11 games before being absolutely hammered by Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "It was a warning they failed to heed in the summer, with Gracia authorised to oversee an opening month in which Watford lost three games and drew one before the international break allowed time for pause.",
      "Watford sacked Gracia, brought in Quique Sanchez Flores, sacked Sanchez Flores, brought in Nigel Pearson, sacked Pearson and accepted relegation with Hayden Mullins at the helm.",
      "Fast forward to the October 2025 international break and Watford have reappointed Gracia because they are a ludicrous institution.",
      "",
      "One win and nine defeats in 12 games after promotion through the play-offs did for Jokanovic, whose longest spell in management by about a year was brought to an abrupt end as Fulham tried to prevent a relentless slide back to the Championship.",
      "The Cottagers spent a small fortune in the summer, including £15m invested on Alfie Mawson for as many Premier League appearances in four years. A powder keg partnership with the club was always liable to explode and a 2-0 defeat to title-chasing Liverpool at Anfield just happened to light a fuse which would have burned eventually.",
      "In a wonderful show of ambition, relegation-bound Fulham chased Arsene Wenger before quickly admitting defeat. In the same statement announcing Jokanovic’s sacking, they unveiled Ranieri as his replacement. A call from Manchester United would probably reverse his latest retirement.",
      "The question with Manchester United is not ‘are they in a crisis?’ but ‘how do they stop being in a crisis?’ And we really don’t know if there’s an answer.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Aleksander Ceferin and UEFA *have* set a precedent allowing domestic league games to be played overseas. Claiming otherwise is disingenuous.",
      "While Forest ponder another managerial change, Ange Postecoglou faces the very real prospect of presiding over the Premier League’s shortest-ever reign."

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "Neville has come in for a lot of stick over the last week with the Daily Mail’s reporting of his comments particularly concerning as they described them as a ‘racist’ outburst.",
      "Despite the former Man Utd and England defender making a wider point condemning “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and urging everyone to unite “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony”, they have predictably been dragged out of context in certain quarters.",
      "Here we have put together nine of the best, worst, and honestly most terrifying views on Neville’s comments this week…",
      "",
      "“In his, obviously, isolated world he lives in, he’s in the kind of ivory tower position of being shuttled into a Sky studio, back behind a wall in whatever sprawling estate he’s got, they’re saying he’s worth between £50m and £70m. People are telling me that Overlap earns all them £20,000 a pop, they’re sponsored by ARNE now so surely ARNE’s going to be delighted with Gary saying that because I would imagine their target audience is white, middle-class men. It’s definitely not fella’s called Jihad, white, middle-class men called Jihad. I can’t imagine there being that many of them around.",
      "“But Gary’s got himself into this virtue signalling nonsense. We have this pillock, Neville, and he’s crossed over with me because as I said to him and Rio last night, I’m more than welcome to debate both of you. Let’s roll for two hours, discuss any topic. Gary sat in a room with me when we did The Edge podcast, you don’t need to be scared of me, but intellectually I think you’ve got a lot to answer for here.",
      "“I don’t think Gary Neville has thought about who are his audience. Because I’m looking at it going, you’ve just said people who like the Union Jack, people who are patriotic to show their country’s flag in, in this instance, the country he’s from and represented 85 times at international level…just factor in if he said somebody with brown skin or somebody with black skin, there’d be an absolute outrage about it.”",
      "The delightful Barton added: “People like this, gaslighting you all the time, saying to you: ‘no, no you’re a racist for thinking that. You’re far right for thinking that.’ There’s a synagogue attacked and we get a f*****g d***head footballer, absolute idiot, whose ar**hole is for rent to the highest bidder.",
      "“If that’s the Qataris, he’ll forget anything to do with human rights to go and take the Qatari money. He is a whore who is open for exploitation as he has shown this weekend with his stupid comments.",
      "“Now, if he was a man of the people, like he says he was, and if he was really in touch with his fanbase or the people that support his shows or his football club or some of his businesses, then he would know middle-aged white men in this country aren’t the problem.",
      "“Sticking a few flags up and being petrified that your daughters or your granddaughters or your wife are going to be accosted in a changing room by an illegal invader is not a f*****g far right position.”",
      "READ: Neville a ‘traitor’ and Postecoglou sack imminent to bafflement of Daily Mail",
      "",
      "“I think it’s astonishing in the wake of an Islamist terror attack that he decides to have a go at middle-aged white men.",
      "“Maybe the middle-aged white men are the ones who worked on minimum wage inside his hotel, I don’t know. I think he’s a champagne socialist and a coward. It’s a dreadful thing to have said.”",
      "Pushed on why Neville is a coward, Jordan went on: “I think the real issue is about radical Islamist extremism and he doesn’t have the balls to call it out for what it is, rather than suggest that challenging our country about what’s happening, he’s insulated from these things.",
      "“He lives in a very rarefied world where his money and privilege has allowed him to live in a gated environment, not have to worry about NHS appointments, doesn’t have to worry about people being attacked in the streets by immigrants that shouldn’t be here in the first place.",
      "“He doesn’t have to worry about these things, so he has the ability to sit there and observe in such a way that insulates himself from it. I think it’s an appalling stance to have taken.",
      "“He’s entitled to his view, he’s entitled to a view. We are quite happy to wave any other flag in this country, whether it’s Palestinian flags, Ukraine flags or any other flag that we feel we’re able to wave.",
      "“But when you’re talking about people in this country that have legitimate concerns and want to have a legitimate value set and push back against what they’re having forced upon them, for Gary Neville to say what he said is the exact embodiment of being a champagne socialist, insulated from the real world and a coward because the real issue is some of the extremism going on in this country.”",
      "",
      "Le Tissier told students at Southampton Solent University: “He’s basically attacked the demographic of people that are paying his wages, which is a bit strange.",
      "“I think it depends on what side of the argument you fall on and whether your side of the argument suits the agenda of the current media.",
      "“Which I think, you know, for the large part is very left leaning, so if you’re slightly right leaning you won’t be given the good graces to make mistakes other people will be given.”",
      "The Southampton legend added: “Yeah, I think they’ll stand by him and support him, yeah",
      "“I mean, they stood by Jamie Carragher when he spat at a young girl out of the back of his car.",
      "“It is not quite as bad as that, so I think Gary’s got a pretty fair argument there if they try and get rid of him.”",
      "",
      "“He’s blaming them for all the division, not some evil, crazed, mad Islamist who went out to kill innocent people.”",
      "Farage added: “I will tell you what, this Gary Neville is so detached from reality, so detached from the average football fan, it is not true.",
      "",
      "“I’m sorry — I know I tell you every week I’m gonna come here and I’m gonna be calm. We’re being told that we’re being turned against each other mainly by angry middle-aged white men who deem it OK to put up flags.",
      "“I’m not gonna sit here and say stick to football, everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but why am I surrounded by people like Neville who have made millions on the back of working-class people — people they’re supposed to represent, people they’re supposed to respect?”",
      "Kyle added: “Does he actually believe that middle-aged white men raising flags is causing division in this country?",
      "“Three hours after those poor, poor Jewish people on Yom Kippur were murdered by that terrorist called Jihad… a protest march not three hours later, not a mile away, with people waving Palestinian flags and shouting obscenities — but Gary Neville wouldn’t mention that, would he?",
      "“But if you stood up and said it’s disgraceful that these people are marching and inciting violence, people like Neville would say, ‘Oh but it’s unfair.’ But it’s alright to attack middle-aged white men.”",
      "Kyle continued: “I tell you what Gary Neville, do two things: take your fortune and give it to every immigrant and every group that you think isn’t treated well in this country — do that, but you won’t, will you?",
      "“Or go and live somewhere, you numpty, where there are immigrants on the streets and where your teenage daughters might not feel safe, rather than behind the gates of your massive mansion in Chester.”",
      "",
      "‘We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer. After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.",
      "‘Neville is the classic case of a celebrity so feted within his own sport that he appears oblivious to anything or anybody who might challenge his world view. Gary Lineker fell into the same trap…",
      "‘Neville is discovering the hard way that views that resonate inside his self-congratulatory pundit bubble often collapse on first contact with reality. Hence why his latest video has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest. Perhaps now he realises that if you are going to posture as the voice of balance and reason, you cannot savage the flying of the Union Flag as divisive and then fail even to mention the Palestine Action protests that took place directly after the Manchester outrage, in defiance of calls to show respect to the Jewish community.",
      "‘It is doubly bizarre that Neville invokes his patriotism with the old “I’ve played 85 times for my country” line. These honours, earned from 1995 to 2007, were achieved purely on the strength of his sporting talent, not because of his undying devotion to Queen and country. So why does he now feel an entitlement to define patriotic allegiance for everyone else? The answer, quite simply, is hubris. Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience.",
      "‘His response to the atrocity in his home city might be his most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet. The problem is not just the hopelessly mangled logic, with Neville drawing a line from the act of an Islamist terrorist to enthusiasm for the Union Flag, but that he is biting the hand that feeds. Why is he belittling his own audience? Why does he not pause to consider that he has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch? The problem, hardly for the first time, is not angry middle-aged white men, but multimillionaires called Gary deluded into presuming that their football credentials give them a monopoly on moral virtue.’",
      "",
      "‘THERE was a time, presumably, when Gary Neville wasn’t quite so offended by the sight of our national flags as he now appears to be.",
      "‘When he was playing his 85 games for England I don’t remember him storming up into the stands to rip down St George’s Crosses or Union Jacks waved by enthusiastic fans, nor objecting to men, women and children who joined in the fun by painting red crosses on their faces.’",
      "Clark added: ‘In a video he posted online he boasted of how he had ordered a Union Flag put up by construction workers at a block of flats his company is building in ­Manchester to be taken down.",
      "‘To justify his actions, he claimed that the flag is being used by “angry middle-aged white men” in a “negative fashion”.",
      "‘Quite how you fly a Union Flag ­negatively I am not sure.’",
      "Clark continued: ‘So, no, we have no reason to be ashamed of our flag.",
      "‘On the contrary, we have every reason to fly it proudly from our homes and workplaces — if only the likes of Gary Neville will let us.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems it’s now open season on middle-aged white blokes, all year round. We are the opposite of a protected species. Scape-gammon, if you will. No one will call Neville out on his bigotry, or indeed hypocrisy, as he forgets who paid for the lifestyle he’s enjoyed since the Major years.",
      "‘Neville didn’t just raise a few questions – he also took a wild leap into scape-squirrel territory. He blamed flag-waving middle-aged white men for murders committed by a terrorist literally called Jihad.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems that in modern Britain you can be anything but the dreaded “middle-aged white man” (a description which, it should be noted, also applies to Neville).’",

      "There were flickers of positivity to take from the win over Sunderland as Senne Lammens had a positive debut, while Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo continue to find their feet, but Man Utd are still miles away from where they want to be, and there is little evidence of the club ending their prolonged era of misery.",

      "Over at the F365 tables, some damning findings can be found on Man Utd’s start to this season.",
      "Firstly, Man Utd are bottom of our second half table, having only picked up four points after the break from their seven games.",

      "Also, Man Utd are joint-bottom of the Premier League on points gained from losing positions, with Amorim’s side yet to pick up a single point after going behind this season.",

      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "The Red Devils have been inconsistent once again this season with three wins, three losses and a draw from seven Premier League matches.",
      "Despite beating Sunderland 2-0 at Old Trafford over the weekend, to move them up to tenth in the Premier League, many fans are expecting them to lose to Liverpool after the international break to pile more pressure on to Amorim.",
      "Man Utd are already out of the League Cup and Amorim has now taken just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new recruits over the summer and former Rangers striker Ally McCoist explains why they have to give Amorim “more time”.",
      "McCoist said on talkSPORT: “I actually think I’m at the stage now with United where I think that the manager actually has to be given a little bit more time, and I’ll tell you why.",
      "READ: Man United isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "“Yes, he spent a lot of money. I think the forward line has improved. I don’t think there’s any doubt that Cunha is a good player, Mbeumo, and I think Sesko will score goals.",
      "“But if you look at the players in layman’s terms, the players in the Manchester United defence and midfield are not as good as the midfield and defenders [at other big clubs], whether it’s Arsenal, whether it’s Liverpool, whether it’s City, you can argue Spurs and all these teams.",
      "“I think they’ll slightly improve, but I think there has to be an improvement in the quality of players that they’re bringing in. And I also think that it’s not going to be, certainly not going to be an overnight fix.",
      "“I think it’s going to be another two or three windows, and that’s why I’m probably now at the stage, unless results turn dramatically. I think you’ve got to stick by the manager and give them at least another two or three windows.”",
      "Responding to McCoist, Man Utd legend Ferdinand added: “Man United, I think they’ve had the most entries into the opposition box, most chances. I think so they’re getting certain things right.",
      "“But obviously the big, most critical thing is putting a ball in the back of the net. And they haven’t been able to do that. Haven’t been able to do that by hook or by a crook. So is there an element of lacking confidence? Yes, in front of goal.",
      "“Is there an element, maybe needing a little bit of luck, like anyone, everyone needs luck sometimes. And if those things start to formulate, then we might start seeing a better, more consistent Manchester United.",
      "“But these are all ifs, buts and maybes. And people ask me: how do you feel about Manchester United right now? I’m in the land of hope more than anything right now, and we need to get most of our fans out of that hopeful thinking. And like I said, results and consistency is going to be the only way.”",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has opened up on the future of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and his relationship with the Glazer family.",
      "Ruben Amorim being sacked by Manchester United is justified by three factors that potentially set up a relegation battle for the Premier League giants…",
      "The question with Manchester United is not ‘are they in a crisis?’ but ‘how do they stop being in a crisis?’ And we really don’t know if there’s an answer.",
      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims that Liverpool are “on their knees” after a couple of losses, as he describe one summer signing as doing “alright.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is “having a negative impact on his players” with his post-match comments, according to former staff member."

      "We are entering a drab October international break and also, by sheer coincidence, Crisis Season in the Premier League. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure, we can do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy.",
      "But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach do, at the end of the day.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) just before the barren wasteland of a dreary international break, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Of course, there will always be those clubs where there is no need for manufactured CRISIS storylines. Those clubs who, out of the sheer kindness of their content-generating hearts, find themselves in some state of actual crisis.",
      "And of those clubs, none has been more reliable over recent years than Manchester United. They are putting our kids through college.",
      "It helps, of course it does, that This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. This is a club that sat astride an entire generation of English football at a specifically crucial period for English football.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson remains, in a twisted way, one of the key villains in the story of where Manchester United now find themselves. Looking back, everything he did just made things impossible for absolutely anyone else who came after him.",
      "He not only set impossibly high standards for an impossibly long and successful time, but in doing so allowed everything else at the club to become lazy and complacent, something most visibly obvious in Old Trafford itself and its continuing damp decay. With Fergie at the helm, United literally could not fail. That final title he won before retirement is an almost sarcastic display of achievement despite a club drifting blithely and obliviously towards disaster.",
      "Ferguson left a United playing staff that absolutely nobody else could succeed with, because he might just be the best football manager of all time and nobody else is that.",
      "Unlike, say, Jurgen Klopp and his succession planning at Liverpool, Ferguson did almost nothing to set the next manager up to succeed beyond declaring poor old David Moyes the Chosen One. Even Ferguson’s continued Old Trafford presence in his retirement years feels like it just makes an impossible job even more impossibly hard for whichever poor bastard is currently attempting it.",
      "And some very good and even great managers have tried and failed to lift this giant club from its post-Ferg funk.",
      "Which all rather leaves us pondering something more existential. The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can provide a plausible answer, is not “Are United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. Can you even imagine such a thing? They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, feasibly sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to the absurd levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the ’90s and ’00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they drift further and further from even basic big-club competence.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "Because, again, his record isn’t just ‘Bad for Manchester United’ bad; it’s ‘Bad for any Premier League club’ bad. It is relegation-form bad. The only other Premier League clubs with records anywhere near as bad as Amorim’s since he took over have all changed managers because of it, including one who did so out of sheer embarrassment at only beating United 1-0 in a European final.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but the continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected it.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have at least managed to win two games in a row is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of gentle Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has opened up on the future of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and his relationship with the Glazer family.",
      "Ruben Amorim has barely survived one international break but could fall into the trap of another, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe minded to follow Daniel Levy.",
      "Ruben Amorim being sacked by Manchester United is justified by three factors that potentially set up a relegation battle for the Premier League giants…",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",

      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd last term with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund criticised for scoring just seven league goals between them.",
      "Hojlund left on loan for Serie A champions Napoli over the summer, which will probably turn into a permanent transfer, while Zirkzee stayed at Man Utd as back-up.",
      "The Red Devils spent around £200m on attackers in the summer transfer window with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving.",

      "And no the Daily Mail claim that Zirkzee is ‘deeply frustrated at his situation, and a move in the January transfer window is seen as absolutely crucial if he is to force his way back into the reckoning for the Netherlands’ World Cup squad next summer’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Chido Obi’s return to the academy setup after he played eight times for the first team last season may see United dig in to keep Zirkzee as back-up, in case anything happens to first-choice striker and £74m summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "‘But there is no doubt that Zirkzee’s frustration has escalated significantly in recent weeks, and now his only chance to salvage a season that could cost him a spot at the World Cup appears to be by trying to secure a move away in January.’",
      "Football Insider have a similar report claiming that Zirkzee is set for a ‘surprise exit in January’ with Serie A sides Inter Milan, Juventus and Como ‘looking at the Dutchman’, while West Ham have also joined the race.",
      "Zirkzee has once again been left out of Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands squad for the October international break and the Dutch head coach said back in March that his performances had not been “good enough” to warrant a place in the setup.",

      "These are the same people – Oliver Brown chief among them – who went after Gary Lineker for years, stamping their feet and having tantrums until they finally got what they wanted.",
      "The nature of these people is such that they always have to have some fresh meat to satisfy their bloodlust. They are truly warped and damaged individuals who either genuinely believe in the ill informed weapons-grade bollocks they spout, or worse, they spout it because they don’t want to upset the people who write their pay cheques.",
      "Like Lineker, Neville has a big platform. He has millions of people who listen to his views on a variety of topics. Some of those views terrify these people because the old media ecosystems of a select number of newspapers and 5 TV channels died a long time ago. Whereas back in the day they could just isolate anyone with a centre or centre left view, they can’t anymore. Social media scares them because they can’t control it. It’s sheer terror, raging against the dying of the light.",

      "Sadly, instead of trust in and development of youth, they’ve been used as a scapegoat while the core of the team is the oldest and worst, the players we cannot get rid of – players far worse than the “bomb squad”; the likes of Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Maguire.",
      "I don’t care who the manager is, whether they smile in press conferences or what system they play. I don’t even mind a few losses on the journey, but what I do care about is building a side for the future, and that work has to start now.",
      "Continuing to pick Bruno at CM is misguided at best, but a central partnership with Casemiro rather than letting Mainoo, Ugarte or Collyer develop into the role is the definition of short-term thinking and a suicide note and should be considered as much.",

      "So I keep hearing how other clubs need to click. Man City are transitioning. When Liverpool’s attack clicks, the league will feel it. So Arsenal’s attack will not click? or Chelsea’s attack? Basically, if you look at Man City 1st XI, basically the same team, bar Tejinders and Donnarumma. When you look at Liverpool’s 1st XI, same team, bar Wirtz, Isak, and Kerkez (I do not rate Frimpong, because whoever decided to buy a wing back who can’t cross or defend as a full back should be queried), and if you look at Arsenal’s 1st XI, basically the same team bar Zubimendi, Gyokeres, and Eze.",
      "One of the managers has never won a league title, but I hear stuff like when Liverpool attack clicks, Man City are transitioning, someone even wrote in today, and I quote, “more familiarity in selection. Arsenal got in 8 new players !!!!!!. We need to click too. We need our medical team to sort itself out so we get our players back. We are a work in Progress. Remember, we have never won the league",
      "As an aside, Wirtz was brought in to mitigate Trent’s deep-lying creativity;  most teams will get a deep-lying playmaker. its the logical thing to do as pure No. 10s are a dying breed, but Not Slot, he opted for a No. 10 who played his best and most productive football in his career in a team that had a deep-lying line-breaking playmaker (Xhaka), and did not get any DM with DLP characteristics, although Endo is not really fit for purpose. Secondly, Luiz Diaz left; he was marginally superior to Gakpo. Was he replaced? No. Slot decided Chiesa and Rio will step in, that way Gakpo isn’t challenged anymore, and I remember Elliot coming on for a tired Salah in Paris against PSG, that was also not replaced. I keep wondering why he did not get quality alternatives to his countrymen.",

The initial contact outside the box wasn’t enough… and you should also know, it was Michael Oliver on VAR, so it had to be Stonewall to qualify.",
      "No fuss regarding Paulinha at spurs celebrating a last minute equalizer with his shirty off vs wolves who had lost their first five. If that was an Arsenal player…",
      "Same goes for Maresca going full Mourinho with a winner vs Liverpool like he’d won the league. If that was Arteta…",
      "Last week we had the absolute gems from Newcastle fans saying Gabriel should have been sent off for some handbags with Woltermade and completely ignoring LaScelles going full Nic Cage/John Travolta and trying to swap faces with Gyokeres.",

In his humble opinion, after being shown Ickle Mikel’s light bulb speech, he politely eviscerated it (after stifling a chuckle). He cited the example of the All Blacks’ manager being asked if the team talks he used to do were more for himself than the team. The team, when asked whether they were even paying attention, told him they weren’t taking the slightest bit of notice. So they stopped, because the manager had enough humility to do so, and because it wasn’t adding anything to the overall objective: Win (not the dog Mikel).",
      "The underlying theory being that if you need to cosplay David Brent in the moments before the players go out for kick off, then something is wrong in your match prep. Obviously most managers do some sort of brief team talk, but very few that I am aware of do the kind of cringe whiteboard work that Legohead loves so much.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "Of course pointing at Arsenal when you are dropping points is not the game and that mailbox contributor should wind it in. But I wouldn’t say that you can lose a 5 point lead in gameweek 7. Teams play each other at different times in the season and earn their points at different times. I am of course very much looking forward to playing a promoted team, an Ange Postecoglou team and West Ham at home.",
      "Whilst it is a Rafa fact that Liverpool are playing badly, when did a visit to Stamford Bridge become a 3 point banker? Even if Liverpool were playing very well, there is no reason to expect 3 points from there. Same for Glasner’s Palace away. Galatasaray was what it was. A one nil loss to a weak pen in Turkey in a phase of the Champions League where the prize for coming top of the league is playing PSG. Its just about getting to the next phase. The team with the most points in the group, now league phase, rarely win the tournament.",
      "But Liverpool are playing badly. There’s very little coaching time this time of the season. Its 2 games a week, international break, 2 games a week and now another international week. Although Slot won’t be with his players, hopefully he and his brain trust can work something out otherwise City are starting to look dangerous and we could be looking at third!

      "According to reports, Manchester United have already decided whether to give FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford a ‘surprise lifetime’.",
      "In the summer, Rashford finalised a dream move to Barcelona as he joined the Spanish giants on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "Barcelona sanctioned a move for Rashford following his return to form at Aston Villa, while their failure to sign Luis Diaz and Nico Williams made a deal more likely.",
      "The Man Utd outcast was ineffective in his first couple of games for Barcelona, but he has been one of their best players in recent weeks, grabbing three goals and five assists in ten appearances in all competitions.",
      "Therefore, a permanent transfer to Barcelona is looking increasingly likely and Romano claims he is “very happy” with five things at Barcelona.",
      "“For Marcus Rashford, there’s no obligation to buy, it’s a loan with a buy option for €30 million. This is the fee in case Barcelona decide to sign Rashford in the summer of 2026,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Liverpool dominating PL, Wirtz POTY, new Hojlund among ten PL knee-jerk reactions already wrong",
      "“So Rashford is doing very well, a very good impact, and it’s still the beginning. It’s just two months into his new chapter at Barcelona. So Rashford is very happy with the situation.",
      "“I can tell you that Rashford is very happy with the city, with the league, with the club, with the manager, and with the teammates.",
      "“Rashford loves his new life at Barcelona. And so Rashford is fully focused on Barca, not even thinking about the Manchester United return from the loan and maybe make it again at United one day. The full focus is on Barcelona.”",
      "A report from The Boot Room‘s Graeme Bailey, meanwhile, claims the ‘truth’ on Man Utd’s ‘stance’ is that they have ‘little intention of handing Rashford a surprise lifeline despite his impressive form for Barcelona’.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is thoroughly enjoying his time at Barcelona, he made it clear more than 12 months before that he wanted to move to the Nou Camp,” Bailey told The Boot Room.",
      "“Now in Catalunya, there is no way he wants to return to Old Trafford. United still have him under contract to 2028, but Barca have the option on him and they intend to use it, although they want to talk terms.",
      "“United, in theory, know they could keep him but as it stands the club have little intention of doing so.”",
      "On fellow loanee Rasmus Hojlund, Bailey added: “Hojlund was a case that he had to go; they had signed Benjamin Sesko for huge money – he knew his time was up and the Ruben Amorim system wasn’t working for him.",
      "“Hojlund had such a huge expectation on his shoulders and that is a tough thing to deal with, and it just didn’t work out. But United always believed there was a player there, and they always appreciated his professionalism and the hard work.",
      "“Again, it was no surprise to them that a club like Napoli came in for him, and they are happy to see him performing – obviously, there is no way back as the deal for him is an obligation.”",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports.",

      "Amorim’s failing 3-4-3 system and his blunt refusal to adapt to get the best of his players/earn positive results will be the main reasons for his eventual downfall at Man Utd, who could be left to look for a new manager around a year after appointing the inexperienced 40-year-old.",

      "The Southgate links are largely sparked by his reported strong relationship with Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but it is hardly surprising that most fans are not on board, as the 55-year-old does not exactly have a glittering managerial record at club level.",
      "Still, the biggest potential positive with appointing Southgate is his ability to galvanise a fractured group of players and inspire great results, with this among his best achievements as England boss.",
      "And Howe also possesses this quality, as he’s proven at Newcastle United that he has a unique ability to bring a whole club together, which he has done to an impressive extent in the PIF era at St James’ Park.",
      "The current version of Man Utd is nothing if not splintered and this is largely the doing of Ratcliffe and INEOS, who have alienated themselves by making brutal and sometimes needless cuts since taking control of the club.",
      "But a manager in the mould of Howe or Southgate would unite the Premier League giants, though the Newcastle boss is the superior candidate due to his impressive coaching pedigree at the top level of the club game.",

      "Would he leave Newcastle United for Man Utd? He’d be daft to at this stage, but Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha proved where the two clubs lie on the footballing food chain by opting for the Red Devils in the summer.

      "We were all wrong about Liverpool, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko as these ten 2025/26 Premier League knee-jerk reactions have already been debunked…",
      "Ahead of this season, Liverpool were many people’s favourites to win the Premier League once again, with it becoming the overwhelming consensus that they would do so at a canter once they won their opening five games and Arsenal stuttered in their opening matches.",
      "However, the wheels have fallen off in recent weeks as Liverpool descended into a mini-crisis ahead of the international break, losing three away games in a row against Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "In truth, the warning signs were there before this sobering run of results, with Liverpool relying on last-minute goals and moments of magic to overshadow subpar team performances during their winning start.",
      "And in their last three games, Liverpool’s luck has run out as they have suffered three deserved defeats, while Arsenal have capitalised to move to the top of the table.",
      "It was initially felt that Liverpool’s statement £400m+ summer spend on signings would make them unstoppable in the Premier League this season. However, it now appears that head coach Arne Slot has made too many changes in a single window and his side’s severe lack of balance at least means they will not steamroll Arsenal and others en route to their 21st crown.",
      "READ: Top ten Premier League defectors features more players from Liverpool than Man Utd",
      "",
      "One such change has seen Slot tweak his midfield and introduce a natural No.10 following the once-British record signing of Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for £116m.",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Manchester City to Wirtz set Liverpool’s stall out for a remarkable summer window, with the special 22-year-old backed heavily as a pre-season favourite to win this season’s PFA Player of the Year award.",
      "But it says a lot about how Wirtz has performed for Liverpool to date that he has suddenly dropped from first to sixth in our ranking of the likeliest winners of this accolade in 2025/26.",
      "007 has become 009 as Wirtz, barring the odd flashes of quality, has been ineffective in all of Liverpool’s Premier League and Champions League matches this season, though he has also been impacted by Slot’s side failing to operate as a unit, with players in all positions suffering.",
      "Wirtz will eventually come to life for Liverpool because he’s too good not to, but he already has very little, if any, chance of picking up the PFA Player of the Year award at the end of his debut season at Anfield.",
      "",
      "This season is huge for Arsenal and head coach Mikel Arteta, who have no excuses remaining as they finally look to win big prizes following so many near misses in recent seasons.",
      "After spending around £250m on summer signings, Arteta arguably has the most complete squad in the Premier League with quality options in every position and were Arsenal to come up short, it has been suggested that their head coach’s overreliance on the handbrake would be their undoing.",
      "This argument was brought up as Arsenal left points on the table against Manchester City and Liverpool, though Arteta has implemented changes to put this right in recent weeks.",
      "Arteta went for the proverbial jugular against Newcastle United and his newfound attacking intent reaped rewards as Arsenal earned a 2-1 comeback away victory, which already feels massive. And there was confirmation of a turning point in their next game as he experimented with Eberechi Eze and Martin Odegaard in an exciting midfield three alongside Declan Rice against West Ham.",
      "So, for now at least, Arteta appears to have binned his handbrake as recent victories have given him the blueprint on how to overcome the low block and win while chasing a game, which could be pivotal in this season’s title race.",
      "MUST-READ PREMIER LEAGUE FEATURES ON F365…\n👉 Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, Postecoglou, Liverpool, Amorim, Spurs, Maresca\n👉 Ange clear Sack Race favourite but Liverpool ‘mini-crisis’ sees Arne Slot level with Scott Parker\n👉 No Liverpool players in Premier League XI of the season so far as striker drops out",

      "Everyone associated with Liverpool and Arsenal would have let out an audible gulp when Man City hammered Wolves 4-0 away on the opening weekend via a brace from Erling Haaland and goals from summer signings Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki.",
      "However, those same individuals breathed a sigh of relief as Man City followed this big win up with back-to-back losses against Spurs and Brighton, suggesting that Pep Guardiola’s winning machine may not be fully fixed after all.",
      "Man City are certainly in a better position than last season as Phil Foden’s return to form and Gianluigi Donnarumma’s great start have been huge positives, while Haaland has taken his goalscoring and overall game to extraordinary new heights.",
      "Still, this Man City squad is a far cry from the champions of years gone by, with their fragility proven by their opponents’ lack of fear when facing Guardiola’s side who, even with Donnarumma in goal, look shaky at the back and are struggling to put teams away. They will be fine for the top four again, but it’s too soon in their rebuild phase to seriously challenge Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s Club World Cup final win over Paris-Saint Germain felt like a coming-out party for Enzo Maresca’s side after they showed great resilience to finish in the top four and win the Europa Conference League to take pressure off of the head coach.",
      "And some argued that their Club World Cup triumph would propel them to being credible Premier League title challengers this season and winners in the next couple of years, but their start to this campaign has indicated that they are in a similar position to 2024/25 and how swiftly an outlook for a manager can change.",
      "The Maresca sack hype picked up last month as Chelsea lost three games in five and their only win was against League One side Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The pressure on Maresca has eased following much-needed wins over Benfica and Liverpool, though Chelsea are lacking a top-quality goalkeeper and centre-back required to take them to the next level.",
      "",
      "“I can only congratulate them in Stuttgart for finding, so to speak, an idiot who would pay that much money, because we certainly wouldn’t have done that.”",
      "Former Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge exemplified the clear bitterness of the Bundesliga champions with this childish dig at Newcastle United over paying £69m to sign Woltemade.",
      "Yes, Newcastle’s desperation to land a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak was exploited by Stuttgart as the Premier League side overpaid to sign Woltemade, who headed to England relatively unproven after only one good season in the German top flight.",
      "But Woltemade sparkled at the summer’s U21 European Championships and has expertly handled the immense pressure of succeeding Isak, with the confidence boost of a debut goal certainly helping his cause.",
      "The 23-year-old has a credible case to be one of the signings of the summer after scoring four goals in his opening seven games, especially considering the pressure he’s under amid the absence of fellow arrival Yoane Wissa. Rummenigge is actually the “idiot”…",
      "",
      "There was a ridiculous early-season clamour for Emery to be sacked by Aston Villa amid their alarming start to this campaign.",
      "In hindsight, everyone should have seen this coming following their failure to secure Champions League qualification, limited transfer activity and speculation surrounding the futures of several key players.",
      "The Premier League’s PSR rules have stuffed Aston Villa more than most, with these factors contributing to Villa finding themselves in the Premier League relegation zone at the start of this season.",
      "The loss of form of Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins has made Aston Villa goal-shy, but Emery has found some answers as they have dug deep to climb out of the mire with four consecutive wins in all competitions.",
      "Villa still have their issues with a squad of lesser quality than last season and they will likely struggle to replicate their 2024/25 sixth-place finish, but Emery remains the most important person at Villa and it was daft for anyone to think that they would be better off without him.",
      "",
      "By signing up-and-coming forward Sesko instead of a proven upgrade, e.g. Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen, to solve their striker problem, Man Utd ran the risk of landing another Hojlund.",
      "In his first season at Old Trafford, Hojlund proved his worth by netting a respectable tally of 16 goals in all competitions, but his second year was a completely different story as he lost all of his confidence and was a shell of his best self.",
      "So it was understandable that United felt he needed to be offloaded and replaced in the summer, with INEOS eventually settling on Sesko, a similar profile of striker, to succeed the Napoli newbie at Old Trafford.",
      "As expected, Sesko immediately came under scrutiny at Man Utd and was quickly written off amid his slow start, but he’s gradually found his feet by scoring in his last two Premier League games. Hojlund, meanwhile, has been a revelation at Napoli, netting four goals in six games, to make a permanent transfer “almost guaranteed”.",
      "The respective performances of these strikers in recent weeks suggest that they have the tools to succeed at Man Utd, though that is heavily dependent on the service provided to them; Sesko is currently dealing with this better than Hojlund did.",
      "",
      "It was hard not to worry about Brentford as they lost Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa in a single window, while outsiders feared for the worst once they appointed novice boss Andrews to replace their beloved predecessor.",
      "And while these worries were backed up by their 3-1 opening weekend loss to Nottingham Forest, Brentford and Andrews have recovered in their subsequent matches.",
      "Helped by the goalscoring of fit-again Igor Thiago and inspired summer signing Jordan Henderson, Brentford have moved out of the bottom three via Andrews schooling Ruben Amorim and beating Aston Villa.",
      "Brentford still are expected to be in the bottom six this season as they have a weaker squad than recent years, but Andrews is quickly proving himself to be capable of the head coach’s role and it would not be a shock at all if he guides them to survival.",
      "",
      "The fight at the bottom is certainly more interesting than it’s been in recent seasons and this is largely thanks to the promoted sides recruiting well and making necessary tactical tweaks to make them more competitive at this level.",
      "Sunderland have been a breath of fresh air under Regis Le Bris and certainly look the most likely of the promoted teams to survive, while Leeds United, despite their lack of bite in attack, have shored up defensively to give themselves a strong platform to secure positive results.",
      "Burnley also acquitted themselves well in their opening couple of matches, but it has been more of the same since the end of August, with Scott Parker’s side only picking up a single point since their sole Premier League win of the campaign against Sunderland.",
      "This already leaves the Clarets in the bottom three and it’s difficult to see a significant improvement en route to another relegation without a scrap due to their newfound defensive frailties and their attack being even worse than it seems as they overperform their xG.",
      "Former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has allayed fears for Florian Wirtz, stating he himself had to “adjust a bit” and the midfielder will “delight us all” ...",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand reckons Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta will be “thanking God” that he signed Eberechi Eze over the summer.",
      "Liverpool summer signing Florian Wirtz could be given the chance to leave Anfield as early as next year with Real Madrid interested, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be praying for a potentially game-changing reprieve after Mikel Arteta’s new experiment against West Ham United confirmed a turning point…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have reportedly ‘submitted an offer’ to sign a Barcelona star after learning a key ‘demand’ for this transfer.",
      "In the summer transfer window, Man Utd invested heavily on a squad overhaul to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens for around £230m combined.",
      "The Red Devils also balanced the books by offloading Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, but they are still far away from challenging for major trophies under co-owners INEOS.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim remains under immense pressure as one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked, so it remains to be seen whether he is the answer for Man Utd long-term.",
      "What is clear is United’s need to make more key signings in the upcoming transfer windows, with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba mooted as a top target as they eye a top-tier No.6.",
      "READ: The one ‘ridiculous’ mistake Amorim keeps repeating which could ‘cost’ him his job at Man Utd",
      "Man Utd have also been sporadically linked with an audacious move for Barcelona star Raphinha in recent months, with most of these reports coming from untrustworthy outlets in Spain.",
      "Fichajes are one such example of a not-so-trustworthy Spanish outlet, with the website claiming that ‘the Red Devils have submitted offers ranging between €120 million and €150 million for the Barcelona winger’.",
      "At a minimum, these proposed bids are worth £102m (120 million euros) and the report has also shed light on Man Utd and Barcelona’s stance on this fantasy deal.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Barcelona is demanding a minimum of €120 million for its star player. Meanwhile, sources close to Manchester United assure that this figure would not be an impediment if viewed as a strategic investment. The English club believes signing Raphinha could make a difference in rebuilding its squad.’",
      "‘One of the key factors that could play in Barça’s favour is that, shortly before the most intense rumors emerged, they renewed the player’s contract until June 2028. This gives them a strong position to negotiate or even reject offers that don’t convince them.’",
      "More exits are also possible for Man Utd in January as Kobbie Mainoo remains heavily linked with a departure after he missed out on a loan departure in the summer.",
      "Mainoo has been a bit-part player under Amorim and journalist Sacha Tavolieri claims he is still in ‘Napoli’s sights’, with it possible that a deal is ‘concluded quickly’.",
      "Tavolieri explains: ‘In advanced discussions with Manchester United at the very end of the summer transfer window, Napoli are maintaining contact with Kobbie Mainoo’s entourage. What’s more, the Partenopei are reportedly in pole position to land the promising English midfielder.",
      "‘A loan move is being considered as early as the January transfer window to give him more playing time and continue his development in a competitive environment. The Italian club hopes to conclude this deal quickly.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘closed a deal’ ahead of the winter transfer window, while Kobbie Mainoo is ‘ready to leave’.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or.",
      "Man Utd are prepared to allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window on one condition, according to reports.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that England international is likely to “force a move” away from Old Trafford in January.",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports."

      "“Then they could go and look at some of their targets to strengthen the squad with that money coming in, because it’s an area they feel they could improve.",
      "“A lot will depend on how they perform this season, because if they do well, perhaps get into Europe, then he will have been a key part of that.",
      "“If they don’t, then the club could look to move in a different direction and I’m sure it’s something he’d be open to as well.”",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another Man Utd star linked with an exit in 2026 as he has only been a bit-part player for the Red Devils at the start of this campaign.",
      "United opted to keep Zirkzee and offload Rasmus Hojlund in the summer, though the Dutchman has been impacted by the arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "We have bits on Arsenal and Crystal Palace too.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Before the season started I wrote in saying how I’d be very happy if United reached the second international break with 12 points. Well so far we’ve had two terrible performances against City and Brentford, two good performances against Arsenal and Sunderland, two half and half performances against Fulham and Burnley, then one sort of good but also sort of not performance against Chelsea. A properly mixed bag resulting in 10 points.",
      "I’m not happy with that but given the fine margins involved I am content for the moment. If Bruno scores that penalty against Fulham or Collins is sent off in the Brentford game (as Webb has now admitted should have happened) then perhaps we’d be where I wanted. No amount of whataboutery could put a positive spin on this season so far though I think it’s reasonable to say United are within the margins of error for my preseason expectations.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re not good and have been embarrassing at times, but outside of the Grimsby result I don’t think there is enough to seriously consider a managerial change at the moment. I think much of the despair from fans and the pressure on Amorim is linked with that cup exit which will linger and even grow until a decent run of form is achieved.",
      "Speaking of which, the next yardstick I suggested preseason was around 30 points by Christmas. Beyond the next game away at Liverpool where I expect no points (regardless of their tiny blip in form they are massive favourites for the win) there will be 9 league games to achieve this. So at minimum its 5 wins and a few draws to stay within the margin of error of +/- one result. There are some particularly tough games in that run (Spurs, Palace, and Bournemouth) but the whole league is tough so if Amorim can’t get it done now he likely never will.",
      "He made a few subtle changes to his system against Sunderland with an almost 4-4-2 formation out of possession which may help going forward. However, the centre back subs are getting a bit ridiculous now. I wouldn’t mind if there was any perceivable advantage. De Ligt has been great in the central role but is a lost and panicking mess whenever he’s asked to be a wide centre back. Why then keep moving him out there just so you can bring on Harry Maguire instantly making the defence significantly slower and more vulnerable? More than systems or formations or whatever its those kind of decisions that will cost us late goal and perhaps ultimately Amorim’s job.\nDave, Manchester",

      "The defending champions and the serial champions prior to them haven’t “clicked” but the team at the top of the table despite their injuries and tough schedule should’ve seen off the competition by week 6 of 38… because of net spend (we never talk wages though)? Ha!",

However, Everton appear to have brought the idea back: according to the Athletic, they have only won three times after conceding the first goal in the past few years, and all three of those have been against Crystal Palace. Happy to help, I guess.",
      "Despite the efforts of F365 and other parts of the football media, most people connected to Palace believe becoming a top four club is a bit of a pipe dream, but meaningfully reducing the gap between Palace and the top four is an admirable, achievable goal. This was brought into sharp focus, because if Palace were a top four club, David Moyes wouldn’t have been able to beat them.",
      "A curious game at the This Means Bramley-Moore Stadium, in that neutrals probably enjoyed it more than fans of either team, who will have mixed feelings about how their respective sides played. Crystal Palace completely dominated Everton for significant periods of the game, but only went in 1-0 up at half time against an Everton team booed off by their fans, then tired significantly in the second half, lost their composure, and ended up losing. The Toffees meanwhile, came out for the second half with a different setup (helped by some very effective substitutes), played their way into the game and came away with all three points.",
      "Like all winning teams, Everton’s winner had an element of fortune about it, but there’s no doubt Jack Grealish was in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing, when the ball rebounded off him into the goal. Bit of a rubbish way for the unbeaten run to come to an end but that’s just how it goes sometimes. I don’t think the defeat suggests anything too drastic needs to change for Palace, you can’t plan for players missing gilt-edged chances provided they keep creating chances, and you can’t plan to completely prevent players getting tired, only to mitigate the effects of their fatigue on the rest of the team. It says a lot about how far Palace have come that losing one game is newsworthy.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "It is definitely easy to see how Neville calling for togetherness and unity, denouncing “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and wanting “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony” has incensed and enraged so many people. He must have expected such incendiary, unpleasant words to evoke such a reaction.",

      "The charge is depressingly predictably led by angry, middle-aged white man Oliver Brown of the Daily Telegraph, who lays into ‘a degree of solipsism remarkable even by his own standards’ from Neville – a reminder that his great crime here is wanting people to come together and not hate and kill each other – before landing on that money-making quote:",

      "The people Neville ‘disdains’ are those who spread and incite prejudice and hatred based solely on nationality and the colour of someone’s skin. It is only ‘strange’ that we are supposed to pretend he is being unreasonable in that stance.",
      "It is also bizarre that a supposedly reputable journalist can write freely that Neville’s video ‘has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest,’ without any actual evidence of such. Are those ‘increasing threats’ in the room with us now, Oliver?",
      "‘Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience,’ Brown adds. Think he’s just acting as if he has an opinion and a platform, to be honest. So do you, and yet this is how you choose to use it.",

We’ve only considered players in Europe’s top five leagues – or four, as we’re discounting players who have swapped one Premier League club for another – as it’s early days in our journey to full football enlightenment.",

      "The 22-year-old scored six minutes into his Leverkusen debut and has played every minute of nine games in all competitions, retaining his place in the starting XI under Kasper Hjulmand after the comically brief tenure of Erik ten Hag. The German side have picked up ten points from their four games under the new manager, conceding just three goals.",
      "When exactly does that buyback clause become active?",
      "",
      "Returned after a season-long loan with Real Sociedad to concede 11 goals in three games for West Ham, and while that evidence suggests he’s a very lucky centre-back to have received the call from Marseille, conceding just one goal in four games for the Ligue 1 side suggests Aguerd may not have been the problem.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck. He and the other Catalan bosses are ‘stunned’ that they will be able to secure Rashford’s £26m ‘massive bargain’ transfer at the end of the season.",
      "After that wholly predictable and depressing hokum about Barcelona wanting to ‘send Rashford home’ after a couple of games, he’s scored three goals – including the outstanding brace against Newcastle at St James’ Park – and claimed five assists to assert himself as a fixture in Hansi Flick’s starting XI.",
      "",

      "O’Riley said it was a chat with former Seagulls boss Roberto De Zerbi which persuaded him to make the switch to Marseille and it’s paid off so far, with the 24-year-old grabbing a goal and an assist in the most recent of four victories in the four games he’s played so far.",

Three goals and two assists in eight games isn’t outstanding, and Antonio Conte raised eyebrows after leaving him out of the starting lineup for Genoa on Sunday, but his impact off the bench illustrated just how key he will be if Napoli are to win back-to back Scudettos.",

      "If you wanted to learn how best to speedrun the all-too frequent flopping of young Manchester United footballers in the stress cauldron that that football club has become, Peter Schmeichel is putting on a clinic.",
      "A search for reasons as to why talented footballers arrive at the club and often briefly show promise before crumbling under the pressure should provide cause for introspection for the members of the Manchester United punditry caucus, who are absolutely just doing their jobs, but could also do with avoiding being so entirely hot and then cold, or vice versa, in their assessments of these players.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez,” Peter Schmeichel said just over two weeks ago. “In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time.”",
      "Lammens could be the kind of guy to use that as motivation, but may also have found it hard to ignore a legendary Manchester United goalkeeper a) admitting he doesn’t know who the f*** he is, b) insisting United should have signed someone else and c) ramping up the pressure by questioning his ability to cope with it.",
      "And yet, after one (one!?) appearance for Manchester United, in which the fans serenaded the 22-year-old with chants of “are you Schmeichel in disguise”, one would hope with their tongues at least somewhere near their cheeks given he didn’t do an awful lot, Schmeichel claimed there was “some semblance to Edwin [van der Sar]”.",
      "“First of all, it’s nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance,” Schmeichel said.",
      "“It’s what you see, you see this young lad, he didn’t really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "“You’d expect that from any young goalkeeper these days – as that’s how they’re brought up – so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he’s done that, he’s a goalkeeper now, he’s saving balls.”",
      "Schmeichel did caveat his praise for Lammens by insisting “it’s far too early to talk about if this guy is good or not”, but you can’t help but laugh at Schmeichel’s admission that “it would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him” less than a minute after comparing him to one of the greatest Premier League goalkeepers of all time.",
      "We get that he was asked about him and Lammens might not even be aware of what he’s said, but plenty of fans will have heard that and many will have read the article published by the official Manchester United website titled ‘LAMMENS: KEEPER OF PROMISE”. Again, after one actual game of football.",
      "We love a kneekerk reaction, and balls in a vice, we would say Lammens looks like the real deal. But we have no skin in the game. If anything, another United goalkeeper being terrible is much more fun and thus more clickable for the majority of our readers.",
      "Maybe Schmeichel and the rest of the cabal of United pundits are of a similar mind. Is it in their best interests for their former club to continue being a mess? If it’s not, we really think they should avoid comparing a goalkeeper with one Premier League appearance to another who’s won it four times.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner at United, has said he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "The Sunderland performance demonstrated flexibility from Amorim, something he has been accused of lacking. The team defended in a 4-4-2 and attacked in a 3-4-3.",
      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",
      "United's ultimate aim for this season is a return to European football. Whether that is the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League - we will have to wait and see where this team can end up, but the reality is this team is still being rebuilt.",
      "The next run of fixtures will give all watching a better indication of what will be possible this season - with away trips to Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and just the one home fixture to Brighton before the next break - no matter how the results go, we will learn a lot.",
      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",
      "United have gone through change at their academy leadership level - with new academy director Stephen Torpey succeeding Nick Cox, who has joined Everton as technical director.",
      "With Torpey's recent arrival, United, led by director of football Wilcox, are keen to accelerate plans to rebuild the academy in the hope the facilities will match some of the best in the world.",
      "United decided not to develop the academy facilities at the same time as the men's first team as it would have been too disruptive on site, but having invested in both the men's and women's facilities in recent years, their next focus is the academy.",

      "Wednesday 8 October 2025 21:37, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",

      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",

      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",

      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",

      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",

      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",

      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",

      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",
