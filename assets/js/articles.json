      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox will play a role in deciding the appointment of the next permanent Man Utd head coach.(Image: Jacob King/PA Wire)",
      "Manchester United would be happy to appoint a World Cup manager as their next permanent head coach. Newly appointed interim head coach, Michael Carrick, began his second temporary spell with a 2-0 victory vs Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime.",
      "However, United are in the process of considering who their next permanent head coach will be, having sacked Ruben Amorim at the start of the month. They have already been linked with Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti, Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann and England's Thomas Tuchel, while Mauricio Pochettino - who is now in charge of the USA - is also claimed to be in the mix.",
      "However, all four will not be available until after the World Cup which ends on July 19. Nevertheless, according to reports, United are happy to wait until after the competition in the USA, Canada and Mexico to appoint their next permanent head coach at Old Trafford.",
      "The Telegraph reports that United may be willing to wait until after the World Cup to make an appointment with the four not 'discounted' for the role. It is, however, mentioned that current and former Premier League managers Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola and Roberto De Zerbi could also be in the running.",
      "It adds that the club have already made a decision on a key factor that will help them make the final call. The new permanent head coach will be selected on his ability to deal with all pressure which comes with managing United.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The next appointment is, therefore, likely to be 'someone very different to Amorim'. The Portuguese head coach was dismissed after an explosive press conference following the 1-1 draw with Leeds earlier this month.",
      "Amorim was said to be unhappy with 'micro-managing' from technical director, Jason Wilcox, with tension said to be there between the two. But it seems the new head coach will be given the same power as Amorim had.",
      "Rube Amorim was brutally sacked as head coach of Man Utd.(Image: Martin Rickett/PA Wire)",
      "It means that there will be collaboration between the new head coach and key figures in a department led by Wilcox over certain decisions at the club. Co-owners Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers will also have a say on the decision-making.",
      "However, the result over City suggests the club are in safe hands under Carrick, at least for now. Bryan Mbeumo finished off a classic counter-attack just after the hour mark to send Old Trafford wild.",
      "Patrick Dorgu grabbed the vital second after Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring.(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "United could have won the game earlier had it not been for some great goalkeeping from City shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian's resistance was eventually broken down on the 76th minute when Patrick Dorgu slid in to convert Matheus Cunha's low cross into the far corner.",
      "The win over City and Liverpool's surprising draw against Burnley means United are now just one point from the top-four positions.",

      "Man Utd interim boss Michael Carrick saw his team leaked before Saturday's Manchester derby (Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's interim head coach Michael Carrick would have been less than thrilled to see his starting line-up for Saturday's Manchester derby leaked online. Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Casemiro, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo were all brought back into the starting team against Manchester City, as Carrick's side secured a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick opted for an attack without a traditional striker, choosing Amad, Mbeumo (who played centrally) and Patrick Dorgu to start against City. Benjamin Sesko, who had netted three goals in his previous two games, was relegated to the bench, while Matheus Cunha losing his spot was another point of discussion when the teams were announced.",
      "It turned out to be a brilliant move as Carrick guided United to a resounding win in his first match in charge in front of a raucous home crowd. However, the fact that his team was accurately leaked hours before the match will undoubtedly cause some concern, given it could give opponents a slight edge.",
      "This isn't the first time United have been plagued by leaks. The Red Devils reportedly initiated an investigation in December into how then United head coach Ruben Amorim's plans to adjust his system were leaked on the day of a match against Bournemouth.",
      "The Mail reported at the time that United were dedicated to finding the source of the leak to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. A club spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United were also reported to have been 'furious' in September following claims that Red Devils skipper Bruno Fernandes is 'unhappy'.",
      "The club's team line-up was also disclosed well in advance of the Manchester derby in December 2024.",
      "Ruben Amorim saw his Manchester United formation change leaked before a game against Bournemouth  (Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I know that story,\" Amorim commented at the time. \"I don't know, I think it's impossible to fix nowadays because you have a lot of people in the club, the players talk with agents.",
      "\"I don't know, you can talk with friends, so it's hard to know. It's not a good thing but let's move on and go to the next one and see if they find the next starting XI.\"",
      "Numerous other stories emerged last season, including those concerning squad problems and team news, with United's senior management taking measures to uncover the source of the leaks within the camp.",
      "Previous managerial reigns at M16, under Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Jose Mourinho, were similarly affected by leaks.",
      "Whilst it clearly poses a significant issue at United, Carrick's immediate priority will undoubtedly be on savouring Saturday's derby triumph, with Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu both finding the net to claim the bragging rights.",
      "The result puts Arsenal in complete control of the Premier League title race and strengthened United's battle for a top-four finish.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has delivered a perfect response following Manchester United's resounding victory over local rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo, who was making his return from AFCON, put the hosts deservedly ahead after 65 minutes, with Patrick Dorgu quickly adding a second to secure the win.",
      "Mason Mount, who came on for Bruno Fernandes in the final stages, thought he had netted a third goal, but it was disallowed for offside after a VAR review. Matheus Cunha had supplied that pass into Mount, having earlier assisted Dorgu's goal.",
      "Along with Mbeumo, Amad was also back from AFCON and he went straight into the starting line-up, resulting in Cunha and Benjamin Sesko being dropped down to the subs bench. The latter didn't even make it on to the pitch - with Mbeumo being utilised as the 'false 9' by Michael Carrick.",
      "Zirkzee might have been expected to join them on the bench, but he was absent from the squad entirely amid January transfer speculation. However, BBC Sport reported that United sources confirmed his absence was due to an injury, not related to ongoing transfer rumours.",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! ** The latest Man Utd news and more on our dedicated Facebook page **",
      "Roma have been linked to signing him in several transfer windows, but he remained at the club even after being left out of multiple squads under Ruben Amorim. He was handed minutes around the Christmas period after injuries to others but has been back on the fringes as of late.",
      "Despite this, the 24-year-old was still present at Old Trafford and he celebrated the goals enthusiastically, both at the time and with a rather explicit message on social media. Sharing United's full-time update on his Instagram story, Zirkzee wrote: \"F****** get in! ! ! !\".",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has been active on Instagram. (Image: )",
      "Zirkzee also shared a photo of himself - alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Tom Heaton - celebrating in the stands, accompanied by three laughing emojis. He also paid tribute to Casemiro, who received the player of the match award.",
      "The win temporarily lifted United to fourth place in the table, although Liverpool overtook them later on, despite managing only a disappointing 1-1 draw at home against Burnley.",
      "Both sides have struggled with consistency this season - but Carrick is determined to ensure such performances become standard under his leadership.",
      "He said: \"That's the challenge, ultimately, and I think it needs to be a version of normal. Certainly, we're not going to have games with the emotion and the feeling of everything that today brought.",
      "Michael Carrick spoke honestly after Man Utd's derby victory. (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "\"I think we all understand that, but there's definitely levels of standards and expectations that we need to live up to from ourselves as much as anyone on the outside. I'm fairly aware of that.",
      "\"Consistency is the key to any success, and if you can find that then you're on to a winner. So that's our challenge, we've got to find a way of doing that.",
      "\"It's a big one next week obviously, another tough one, but on the back of today we've got a good foundation to build on.\"",
      "Zirkzee will be hoping for significant playing time under Carrick - although it appears doubtful, given his potential injury, the limited fixture schedule and the number of other attacking options available to the club.",

      "Oliver Glasner has lashed out at his club(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Oliver Glasner has lashed out at the Crystal Palace board with feelings that his squad is being \"abandoned completely,\" after a 2-1 loss to Sunderland on Saturday. His comments have also sparked concerns that he could be on his way from Selhurst Park ahead of the summer.",
      "The Eagles looked like a shadow of the team that scooped an FA Cup and Community Shield double in 2025 when they landed at the Stadium of Light, throwing away a one-goal lead and returning to the capital empty-handed. Yeremy Pino opened the scoring for his team 30 minutes into the match, only for Enzo Le Fee to level matters almost immediately.",
      "While Jean-Philippe Mateta then seemed to have put the Eagles back ahead, his thunderous strike was ruled out for offside. It was Brian Brobbey who clinched all three points for the Black Cats on the day, cheekily lifting the ball over Dean Henderson with around 20 minutes left to play.",
      "In the aftermath of the loss, Glasner vented his frustrations to BBC Sport, targeting executives at his club for decisions which have proven costly as of recent. He said: \"I've seen a team that is leaving their heart on the pitch. As you have seen we couldn't make a sub, we had no-one on the bench.",
      "\"I feel we are being abandoned completely. Because I can't play many players. They did everything they could and this has been going on for weeks and months now. And we have 12, 13 players from the squad available and we feel no support.",
      "\"The worst thing is selling our captain one day before playing a Premier League game. We are preparing, it's the first week we are training since September, and then we are selling our captain one day before a game. So I have no understanding of this.",
      "\"I have always kept my mouth [closed], but I can't because I have to defend these players, because it was the 35th game today. Yes we get under pressure here and we are unlucky. But again, you can't react, we can't help them, it makes it really tough tonight.\"",
      "When asked about who he felt had \"abandoned\" him, Glasner added: \"It's pretty clear, yeah? It's pretty clear. Again, I didn't sell anyone. If you get your heart torn out twice this season, one day before a game, it was with [Eberechi] Eze in summer, it was with Guehi now, you know?",
      "\"What should I tell the players all the time? What should I tell them? And then I see the performance today for 50, 60 minutes, today it was not easy with all the circumstances going here with 12 players from the squad, and yes then you have 15, 20 minutes when you are under pressure, you concede the goal, I look at the bench, I can't react, just kids on the bench, and this has not happened yesterday, this is weeks ago. That's why I'm really frustrated today.\"",
      "Asked if he had told the board of his frustrations, Glasner explained: \"Of course they know it, we're talking all the time. But again, talk does not win the game.\"",
      "It comes as Glasner announced that he will leave Crystal Palace this summer on the expiration of his contract. The Austrian has been linked with making a move to Manchester United when Michael Carrick's interim head coaching role is up, but Tottenham has also been earmarked as a potential landing zone for him as a result of poor performances from Thomas Frank.",
      "Brian Brobbey scored the winner for Sunderland(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)",
      "However, despite already confirming he will leave the club this summer, Glasner said that he would not be quitting the team early.",
      "“Never, I would never,\" Glasner responded when asked whether he could leave if the situation does not improve in January. \"I will go with this group of players until the end because there is so much respect for them.",
      "“I see how hard they’re working, how hard they fight, they try, try and try.",
      "\"We have to stick together; I know I can trust these players, but for me it feels as soon as we fell safe, not getting relegated, we make these decisions.",
      "\"I'm told at 10:30am, we sell our captain, negotiations have been happening for two-three days so why do I only get told then? We have the chance for amazing season, European football, but no.",
      "\"We can look to who we rely on, we ca rely on the fans, the coaching staff, the players, that’s what we will look to.\"",
      "Speaking about his exit, Glasner revealed earlier this week: \"My decision had already been taken months ago. I had a meeting with Steve in October international break over dinner. I told him I would not sign a new contract with Crystal Palace. We agreed at the time it was best to keep it between us. I told the team today the same. I think it is important to have clarity. I have not spoken to any other club.\"",
      "Elsewhere in his pre-match press conference for Sunderland, Glasner revealed that Marc Guehi was on the verge of completing a transfer. He said: \"When the players want to move on a deal will happen. It looks like it has happened now.",
      "\"Everyone wanted Marc Guehi to stay forever. I wish him all the best for the rest of his career. He is still at the beginning of his great career. He is a fantastic guy.\"",
      "It has since emerged that the centre-back is on the verge of signing a contract with Manchester City, and will undergo a medical with the Sky Blues on Sunday ahead of a £30million move.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The ex-Manchester United skipper didn't hold back in his critique of Maguire's upbeat remarks about Michael Carrick's appointment as the Reds geared up for one of their most challenging matches of the season.",

The England ace, who cost the club £80million when he arrived from Leicester City in 2019, had fallen out of favour under Amorim.",

      "Now, Zirkzee's compatriot Ruud Gullit has urged the 24-year-old to force through a move as he continues to warm the bench in Manchester.",
      "Zirkzee has been urged to move on(Image: Getty)",

      "\"Look at Scott McTominay. It is unbelievable how well McTominay has done since he left Old Trafford. It's incredible, it's fantastic to watch. At United he was more like a 12th man, than he was a player and look how he has flourished, just playing every game is so important.\"",

      "Phil Foden may have suffered an injury against Manchester United(Image: PA Wire)",
      "Pep Guardiola has denied claims Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden suffered a broken hand after falling awkwardly on it against Manchester United. Towards the end of the first half, the England international fell down and broke his fall with his hand.",
      "It was an uncomfortable landing and when Guardiola's side emerged for the second half, Foden was nowhere to be seen. He was taken off for summer signing Rayan Cherki.",
      "After the match, speculation started doing the rounds suggesting he may have suffered a hand injury. This would have rubbed salt into a torrid afternoon which ended with United beating Guardiola's side 2-0, handing a much needed victory to the Red Devils' new interim manager Michael Carrick.",
      "When Foden went down the tunnel at half-time, he was accompanied by a member of City's medical team. His arm could be seen propped up in a set position, suggesting they were trying to protect it.",
      "However, Guardiola has played down reports Foden may have broken his hand. When asked if Foden had suffered an injury, the ex-Barcelona manager quickly replied: \"No, I don't think so.\"",
      "If it had been a serious injury, it would have come at an awkward time for Foden, with the World Cup on the horizon and only six months to prove to England manager Thomas Tuchel he is the one who should be orchestrating England's midfield.",
      "Foden has enjoyed an improved campaign compared to last season, helping himself to seven goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances. However, he is also competing for the No. 10 spot against Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers and Eberechi Eze.",
      "Foden did not emerge for the second half(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Foden was called up to the last international squad and contributed an assist in the 2-0 home victory over Serbia. The next international break will surely be crucial when it comes to informing Tuchel's decision for this summer's World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada.",
      "England face Uruguay and Japan in international friendlies at Wembley Stadium at the end of March. However, the more pressing issue for City as a whole is the fact they are losing even more ground on Arsenal.",
      "Before the derby at Old Trafford, they were six points away from Premier League leaders Arsenal. They are in danger of finishing the weekend nine points behind Mikel Arteta's side with 16 matches left to play.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored the vital second after Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring(Image: AFP or licensors)",

      "“We gave them what they want. They took the game to where they are good and we are not so good. Since I arrived here in England we have always been a very controlled team.",

      "Michael Carrick enjoyed a dream start to his Manchester United reign(Image: Carl Recine)",
      "With his knee bloodied after another tangle with Erling Haaland, Harry Maguire limped back into his own penalty area to help defend the free-kick he had conceded.",
      "Moments later, he was producing a towering header to set up the counter-attack that ended with Bryan Mbeumo giving Michael Carrick a dream start to his 17-game Manchester United audition.",
      "The dream start became fantasy as Patrick Dorgu doubled the delirium before Old Trafford was treated to the symbolic sight of Haaland’s misery being ended by Pep Guardiola. For United, that was just one beautiful moment on a beautiful afternoon.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in town and one match into his tenure, Carrick has already made a compelling case to get the gig for next season. Seriously.",
      "And Maguire’s performance magnificently typified the response Carrick got from Manchester United’s players. Quite simply, they were more aggressive, more determined, more passionate, more committed than a Manchester City team that, at times, looked as though they did not believe a serious title race was still in progress.",
      "United were fantastic, City were a pale imitation of themselves. As belligerent and as bold as Maguire and his team-mates were, Guardiola’s men were meek and weak.",
      "The lamentable defending that gifted Dorgu United’s second goal had been a constant theme throughout the contest. City enjoyed just under 70 percent of the possession - and did precisely nothing with it. Gianluigi Donnarumma was City’s best player, telling you all you need to know.",
      "But this was all about United’s vibrancy and desire under their new manager. If Carrick wanted a reaction in terms of aggression, he certainly got it. But it should have come at a cost, Diogo Dalot’s knee-high stamp on Jeremy Doku seemingly a no-brainer for VAR Craig Pawson to upgrade to a red.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu were on target for Manchester United in the derby(Image: Copa)",
      "It seems Pawson believed there was not sufficient intent, which was odd considering the United full-back was clearly not trying to stamp on the ball, which had long disappeared. And the official explanation was that the contact was glancing. So there you have it, Dalot needs to make better contact when he is trying to injure someone next time.",
      "Yes, as everyone keeps saying, VAR is here to stay but those operating the system are not helping themselves right now.",
      "If Dalot’s misdemeanour was a negative trait of United’s commitment, there was an absolute welter of positives. There was a simpler, faster, more direct approach to United’s style, the emphasis being on getting it out to wide areas quickly.",
      "And while City, predictably, had the majority of the ball, United were always the more dangerous side, with Maguire heading against the crossbar and Mbeumo half-asleep when presented with a sitter. There were also two efforts - from Amad and from Bruno Fernandes - that were ruled out by narrow offside verdicts.",
      "City might have had a touch more panache, United had more passion. In fact, Carrick spent a good deal of the proceedings urging his players to calm down. But as long as Dalot kept a lid on his antics, there was no need to calm down. United were full of zest, City were almost bizarrely subdued.",
      "Guardiola clearly was not happy with what he was watching and withdrew Phil Foden and Max Alleyne at the break. But the introduction of Rayan Cherki and Nico O’Reilly did not give City the injection of urgency they needed.",
      "Not far off an hour had elapsed before Haaland made his first meaningful contribution, a shot blocked by Lisandro Martinez. To put it in basic terms, Haaland had an awful game. Pretty much every time the ball reached Haaland, it was surrendered and in the end, Guardiola raised the white flag for him.",
      "To say the entire City team raised the white flag would be harsh. It would certainly do United an injustice. It would certainly do Carrick an injustice.",
      "And if Sir Jim replaced that short-term deal with a proper one right now, you would not blame him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu were on target for Manchester United in the derby(Image: Copa)",
      "A second half one-two from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu gave Michael Carrick the perfect start to his stint in the Manchester United hotseat as the Red Devils clinched a statement victory over City in the derby.",
      "United started like a house on fire and should have taken the lead through Harry Maguire, who could only head against the crossbar from yards out after just three minutes. More chances came for both sides, including a disallowed goal for Amad, before Bruno Fernandes' fine fun and composed finish was chalked off by the officials, the Portugal international offside by a toe.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma produced a world-class double save minutes into the second half to thwart Amad and Casemiro in quick succession, but Mbeumo did find a way to beat the imperious Italian with a fine low strike just after the hour mark.",
      "Dorgu, impressive again in a more attacking role, made the result safe in the 76th minute to clinch the bragging rights on for the red half of Manchester on a derby day they will remember for quite some time.",
      "The derby was Michael Carrick's first game as Manchester United head coach(Image: Darren Staples/AFP)",
      "A Manchester derby was billed as somewhat of a baptism of fire for Manchester United's new head coach, but it was the hosts who looked the most dangerous in the first half. Maguire's point-blank header ballooned back off the bar in the early minutes and there were further golden chances for Mbeumo and Amad before the latter and Bruno Fernandes both saw goals chalked off for VAR.",
      "United had the better chances in both halves and were good value for their goal when it finally arrived courtesy of Mbeumo. Dorgu made it comfortable not long after to lift the roof from Old Trafford and was no less than United deserved.",
      "This was a statement win for United and Carrick, who could hardly have dreamt of a better start. Nobody will be getting carried away off the back of one 90 minutes. But how United acquitted themselves against a City side many expect to go on and reclaim the Premier League title is definitely cause for optimism.",
      "Gianluigi Donnaromma celebrates after a stunning double save(Image: Darren Staples/AFP)",
      "Donnarumma arrived in the Premier League with a pristine reputation and he showed why he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world in the derby.",
      "He kept United at bay in the first half and his double stop to keep out efforts from Amad and Casemiro after the break was pure quality.",
      "City are light at the back and the impending addition of Marc Guehi will see their title odds shorten for good reason. It wasn't Donnarumma's day today, but the City keeper didn't deserve to end up on the losing side.",
      "Diogo Dalot avoided a red card for this tackle(Image: )",
      "As much as the first half was full of positives for United, they were fortunate to end it with 11 men following Diogo Dalot's poor challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "The Portugal international's foot was high and reckless and left Doku in agony after going right across his knee. VAR deemed it only worthy of a yellow card - just like referee Anthony Taylor. But it should have been red and Dalot was incredibly fortunate not to walk.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was recalled to Manchester United's starting XI for the derby by Michael Carrick(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United FC)",
      "Ostracised by Ruben Amorim, it was no great surprise to see Mainoo back in from the start under Carrick given his dearth of minutes this term has sparked a mix of anger and confusion from fans.",
      "His inclusion here would indicate that he is in line for a more significant role during the second half of the season. And on a day where United fans were given plenty to shout about, that's another big plus.",
      "Arsenal must be sick of the sight of Manchester City. After denying them titles in successive years before Liverpool's triumph last year, Pep Guardiola's men have been on the charge in recent weeks again, applying the pressure on the league leaders.",
      "But defeat in the derby means Arsenal open up a nine-point lead over City if they beat Nottingham Forest in their game, which would leave Guardiola and Co with a mountain to climb.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?' Bad tackle, like that?",

      "Rio Ferdinand does not agree with Roy Keane's comments on Jonny Evans(Image: PA)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Jonny Evans following Roy Keane's criticism of Manchester United for appointing the former defender as a first‑team coach. This week, Keane questioned Evans' arrival on Michael Carrick's coaching staff, claiming he isn't qualified enough in a brutal rant.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week… If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?”",
      "Keane launched his rant after Gary Neville expressed his satisfaction with Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they’re all brilliant,\" Keane added. \"You said you don’t know anything about Jonny Evans coaching because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man Utd and you're going, 'oh that’s okay because we’ve got Stevie Holland,' A new guru!\"",
      "Since Keane's comments, Ferdinand has argued that Evans deserved his opportunity, insisting the former defender knows the squad well, having played alongside nearly every player - and could help Carrick get the best out of the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"The stuff with the coaches and stuff like that, and calling out the coaches, like, Jonny Evans is a young coach. Why shouldn't he get a chance?,\" Ferdinand said on BBC 5 Live.",
      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club? He knows every single player in that club better than any coach on the planet right now, other than the ones that have been there recently, because he's played there. He knows them all. Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand. If you want to get to know what Kobbie Mainoo is like, because you want to reboot him and put him in a team, I wouldn't mind having somebody that knows him, who's been in the changing room, who knows how he works, closer to me.",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"How do we get a bit more out of Bruno? Because you know him. That's the kind of conversation I'm sure that Michael Carrick's gonna want to be having.",

      "Jonny Evans during a first team training session at Carrington this week(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "\"I actually understand why someone like Steve Holland's there. He's experienced. Michael Carrick wants an experienced coach alongside him. He's gone for someone like him. Like, what, should he have gone for what?",

      "Carrick was emotional at full-time.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon. United announced the appointment of Michael Carrick as head coach for the remainder of the season on Tuesday, and the former midfielder made the perfect start by securing a superb derby win.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock in the second half and Patrick Dorgu extended the advantage. Mason Mount came close to putting the icing on the cake with another goal but the midfielder was ruled offside.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed and talking points...",
      "Carrick looked emotional",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes,\" belted around Old Trafford after the final whistle. Martinez embraced Kobbie Mainoo, while Mbeumo and Amad shared a few emotional words.",
      "Carrick took a moment to celebrate with his staff before making his way onto the pitch to soak it up. Pep Guardiola was isolated as he stood on his own to applaud the City away section.",
      "There was also a lap of appreciation. United have made their way around Old Trafford after each game this season, but more fans stayed behind to clap those in red shirts than ever before. Carrick looked like he had a tear in his eye as he eventually disappeared back down the tunnel.",
      "Passion from Carrick",
      "Dorgu was involved in a tangle with Abdukodir Khusanov just outside the City penalty area in the first half, but referee Anthony Taylor was not interested, so Luke Shaw took laying down the law into his own hands and made a crunching tackle in the next phase of play, which earned him a booking.",
      "Carrick began to furiously rant to the fourth official when Taylor decided not to award a foul for Khusanov's grappling, and he looked even angrier when Shaw was handed a yellow card.",
      "It's up for debate how much complaining to the fourth official can actually influence the outcome of game, but it was interesting to see another side of Carrick after a workmanlike first press conference.",
      "Ruben Amorim made headlines with his comments and eventually talked himself out of a job. Carrick did not provide any explosive copy to journalists during his press conference, however, when the players cross the white line, he comes alive and appears to be pretty fierce on the touchline.",
      "Carrick spoke about how much United means to him in the build-up to the Manchester derby, and that was evident as he celebrated both goals. Pundits have scoffed at the importance of having 'United DNA', but Carrick 'gets it' and oversaw a special victory in his first game in charge.",
      "Brilliant Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo received rapturous applause from each corner of the ground when he was replaced by Matheus Cunha with 20 minutes remaining, with fans showing appreciation for his deadlock-breaking goal.",
      "There was a feeling of inevitability when Fernandes slipped Mbeumo into the box following a swift counter-attack. The Cameroon international is deadly in those scenarios and buried his shot into the bottom corner.",
      "The extent of the applause for Mbeumo wasn't a surprise considering he'd just scored in the Manchester derby, but it was notable that almost every fan in the ground rose to their feet in a show of appreciation.",
      "The fact that Cunha was introduced for Mbeumo is also a sign of progress. United were in doldrums last season and could only dream of having such an excellent attacking option on the bench.",
      "Carrick's smart plan",
      "Travis Binnion was promoted from his position as Under-21 boss to work with Darren Fletcher during his caretaker stint, and Binnion retained his role in the backroom staff when Carrick's appointment was confirmed.",
      "Binnion was not in the dug-out alongside Carrick, Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans, though, as he watched the game from behind the press box to pass on information to the touchline.",
      "The theory is that a coach can offer a different perspective from a bird's-eye view. Binnion passed on in-game feedback down to the bench, and Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece to receive it. It may have played a small role in the victory.",
      "Maguire's contrast of emotions",
      "Harry Maguire was recalled to the team and came inches away from making a dream return to the side when he smacked the crossbar with a header just three minutes into the game.",
      "Maguire was two yards out and should have scored. Carrick reacted by jumping up and down on the touchline, while Maguire buried his head into his hands as he returned to his position.",
      "The reaction from the England international said it all, as a goal at the beginning of the game would have sent Old Trafford rocking. Maguire probably feared that United wouldn't create as many chances as good as the one he had just spurned, but they outclassed City in Carrick's first game, and the defender was fist-pumping at the final whistle.",
      "Leaked team? No problem",
      "The starting team was leaked before kick-off, which wouldn't have pleased Carrick ahead of his first game in charge as head coach. The same happened before the Manchester derby in December 2024 when Ruben Amorim was in charge - and the leaks were addressed following that match.",
      "The Premier League is incredibly competitive this term and matches are decided by fine margins, so Carrick would have been irritated by City being handed a small advantage ahead of kick-off.",
      "Carrick has enough on his plate after his return without needing to find out where team news leaks have come from, but he will have to investigate how the information leaked this week. Despite being informed of United's team, City were still played off the park, though.",

      "Michael Carrick was delighted with Bruno Fernandes' performance against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "Bruno Fernandes was back in the No. 10 position for Manchester United and back at the centre of a stunning derby day performance at Old Trafford, with the Portuguese playmaker creating the first goal for Bryan Mbeumo and seeing a strike of his own ruled out after a marginal offside call.",
      "Michael Carrick's return to the dugout at United ended in victory against Manchester City and the players embraced a return to a 4-2-3-1 system, with Fernandes deployed in an attacking set-up designed to pull the visitors out of shape.",
      "It just did that and Fernandes was at the centre of most of United's best moments against Pep Guardiola's side, while Carrick also praised his defensive discipline in helping disrupt City's attempts to build through the middle of the pitch.",
      "Carrick had just three training sessions to prepare his team to face the Blues but he did speak to his captain during the week and was delighted with his display.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I've spoken to Bruno, I've known him a long time now, and I thought he was fantastic today,\" he said. \"The way he played the position, he's so clever, and he takes up space.",
      "\"They had a big disciplined role, him and Bryan defensively as well, to protect the team from anything coming through the middle as much as possible, so it wasn't all kind of playing and positivity to that point.",
      "\"He's just got so much quality, Bruno can adapt and playing in that position he's a real threat and he made the difference.\"",
      "It was an emotional return to the dugout for Carrick, who has now beaten Guardiola, Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta while managing United, as well as drawing with Chelsea when Thomas Tuchel was in charge at Stamford Bridge.",
      "He got the call to replace Ruben Amorim last week but is still a regular at Old Trafford and admitted he always had an idea of how the team should operate, only bringing that into sharper focus when he got the job until the end of this season.",
      "\"I think it's obviously something that clicks into gear when you think it might be on my toes to do something about it,\" he said. \"I've watched a lot, we've got season tickets and my family comes, so I've been to a lot of games over recent times and you get to know the players and your own eye.",
      "\"Everyone has an opinion and your instincts, and then there was a few days to prepare, so the balance of how much information, what the lads could take on, being fair to them to not overdo it, but actually City probably ask you as many questions as anyone could possibly ask, so you've got to have the answers to that, so it was a real balance.\"",

      "Carrick's side produced a dominant performance against City and second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu sealed a deserved victory.",

      "Senne Lammens: Lost his bearings to needlessly concede a first-half corner but made amends with a save from Max Alleyne. Good hands in the second half. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a reckless early challenge on Jeremy Doku and then a poor pass straight out of play, but did well to recover his poise after that. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Should probably have scored early in the game but excellent defensively against Erling Haaland. A real front-foot performance. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Superb sliding block on Haaland early in the second half. Read the game well and was good on the ball. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Booked in the early stages as well but coped well with Antoine Semenyo, who had Phil Foden in support in the first half. Intelligent performance. 7",
      "Casemiro: Should have scored, but excellent recovery tackle on Haaland after Kobbie Mainoo gave the ball away. A magnificent holding midfield performance. 9",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely shimmy past Semenyo a reminder of his talents. A bit careless with a loose pass to Haaland in the second half but deserves a run in the team. 7",
      "Amad: A real livewire. Tormented Nathan Ake and then got Nico O'Reilly booked inside three minutes. Could have easily had a goal and was a threat throughout. Hit the post late on. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Unlucky with the narrowest of offside calls. A sublime pass to create a chance for Dorgu and perfect pass for the goal. Bruno at his best. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu: A surprise selection but what an impact. Sharp on the ball, good first-half volley and really alert to get the second goal. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Exceptional work rate and clever movement to try and pull City's defenders out of position. Good volley to test Donnarumma and clinical with his next chance. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Made an impact at both ends of the pitch. Big tackle on the edge of his own area and assist for Dorgu's goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Little time to make an impact after coming on for the shattered Casemiro. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Thought he had scored late on but ruled out for offside. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven: A late introduction. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Malacia, J. Fletcher, Sesko",

      "Harry Maguire let his football do the talking as he was lambasted by Roy Keane in the build-up to Saturday's Manchester Derby. The former Manchester United captain was incredibly critical of the centre-back for his positive comments over Michael Carrick's arrival as the Reds prepared for one of their toughest games of the season.",
      "However, the Irishman was less than enthused by what he had heard, quickly clapping back: \"Well, what d'you expect them to say? Listening to Harry Maguire there, saying there's a good vibe, there's energy in the place. Of course, that's gonna happen when the new manager comes in.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"We've heard that for the last 50, 60, 70 years. A new manager walks in and says, 'There's a spring in everyone's step, training's been sharper, everyone's in a good mood.' Well, fantastic, because you know what you're here to do?",
      "\"What you're here to do at Man United- I used to fall out with lots of people at United; I did, believe it or not. You have to remind people, and I'm including Harry Maguire, you're here to win. You're here to win; end of story.",
      "\"This idea that everyone's best pals with each other, and there's energy. No wonder Harry spoke well of him; he thought, 'If I speak well, I might get back in the team.' That's what seems to happen there. We'll see what Harry does when the game starts.\"",
      "Keane may have been left eating his words in the aftermath of the encounter between United and City at the Theatre of Dreams, however, in which, his former club claimed all three points. After disallowed goals from Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the first-half, United ran away with it in the second.",
      "Roy Keane was critical of Harry Maguire(Image: PA)",
      "Bryan Mbeumo took very little time to acclimate to the Premier League upon his return from AFCON, breaking the deadlock in the 65th minute, before Patrick Dorgu sealed the deal a little over 10 minutes later in a 2-0 win.",
      "It was also an inspired performance from Maguire, who played the full match and helped United secure a clean sheet against highly-prolific opposition, alongside Lisandro Martinez.",
      "\"I felt that unbelievable from the staff and the players. I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",

      "Manchester United tore into City at Old Trafford in a statement performance under Michael Carrick(Image: )",
      "Three questions, Michael: how long would you like on your contract, what would you like your salary to be, and where would you like your statue?",
      "Manchester United said they wouldn't get carried away this time, but when Old Trafford rocks as it did on Saturday, it can be hard not to. You can guarantee that Michael Carrick is a shorter price to get the job on a permanent basis now than he was when he woke up on Saturday morning.",
      "He couldn't have dreamt it would go this well. This was United's best performance of the season by a long, long way. It was probably their best performance since beating the same opponents in the 2024 FA Cup final. Carrick addressed a group of players on Wednesday morning who had looked beaten down at the end of another manager and after a dismal run of form in a forgiving run of fixtures.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "To bring about this improvement in three training sessions is an eye-opening achievement. United were clever, sharper and more intense than City. Rarely can they have dominated a derby to this extent in the Pep Guardiola era. When the Catalan went to the away end at full-time, he was greeted by empty seats. City fans had long since seen the writing on the wall.",
      "Guardiola had wrapped his hands around Carrick when the whistle went and whispered a few words in his ear. See you next season, perhaps? There's plenty more work to be done until that happens but this felt like a day when the 44-year-old put himself firmly in contention for the job.",
      "He added Guardiola to Mikel Arteta and Unai Emery in the list of managers he has bested while in the United dugout. There was a draw against Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea as well. That is already quite the CV and whatever happens, he will never forget this day.",
      "It had been more than three years since United had last been able to celebrate a derby goal at Old Trafford. That Marcus Rashford strike earned them a victory in January 2023 during a 20-game unbeaten run at home in Erik ten Hag's first season.",
      "For a while, it looked like the Dutchman had cracked the code, but it proved to be yet another false dawn. They've got used to those around here. Amorim has just overseen another wasted 14 months and how futile those dark days look now.",
      "Amorim forced United into a tactical straitjacket, his desire to match up the Premier League's worst team the final straw for a club desperate to see some enterprise and ambition on the pitch once again. Carrick delivered that. Four at the back. Fernandes freed up. Pace and invention on the wings. No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson was smiling.",
      "United played from the first minute as if they had been reinvigorated by Carrick's return. Harry Maguire headed an early corner against the bar and Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Patrick Dorgu.",
      "There was an aggression to United's play that hinted at a desire to make an impression to a third head coach already in 2026, but that spilt over into early bookings for both full-backs. Diogo Dalot left a mark of the wrong kind when he caught Jeremy Doku high on the shin and although contact was only glancing, he was fortunate to not be put through the wringer of a VAR check at least.",
      "Luke Shaw clattered into Rodri to pick up his booking, but the spark in United's play was unsettling City. They hunted the ball in packs and looked to spring forward at speed. Mbeumo's movement pulled around the inexperienced Max Alleyne and Abdukodir Khusanov, while the wingers and Fernandes tried to break in behind.",
      "The method led to Amad and Fernandes both rounding Donnarumma to score in the first half, only for the linesman's flag to deny them. The calls were marginal, but correct; they gave United encouragement that they were on the right path.",
      "If they wanted further vindication, they got it from Guardiola's half-time subs, bringing Nico O'Reilly and Rayan Cherki on, but it did little to contain United. O'Reilly was booked for a foul on Amad within three minutes of his arrival, so he was powerless when the winger ran at him 10 minutes later. Donnarumma saved his shot and then stuck up a hand to keep out Casemiro's follow-up from close range.",
      "When the Italian goalkeeper saved again from Mbeumo a few minutes later, you started to fear United would pay for missing so many chances, but then they struck in a manner straight out of the playbook from derby successes under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "City had control with a free-kick midway in United territory, but when play was turned over, the speed and execution of the break was something to behold. Fernandes led the breakaway, and with three players in support, he picked the perfect pass to Mbeumo, who this time gave Donnarumma no chance.",
      "Ten minutes later, the game was done. City had shown little sign of mustering a response and when Dorgu was more alert than Rico Lewis to reach a Matheus Cunha cross, he sent the Stretford End into raptures. Amad hit the post late on after another thrilling break, and Mason Mount managed a third disallowed goal.",
      "After sharing an embrace with Guardiola, Carrick turned around, a beaming smile on his face, and offered a clenched fist towards his family sitting high in the stands. There was a more visceral show of emotion towards the Stretford End as he headed down the tunnel. He has made his mark.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez revealed that Michael Carrick told the squad to use the support of Old Trafford to inspire them to a win over Manchester City in the Premier League. The Reds came into the derby with the pressure on after Ruben Amorim's departure and recent disappointing results.",
      "However, they looked like the team with more confidence and could have been 2-0 up at the break had it not been for tight offside calls against Amad and Bruno Fernandes. United kept up the pressure in the second half and it finally told in the 65th minute.",
      "Following a City free kick, United hit the visitors on the counter with Fernandes laying it off for Bryan Mbeumo to slot home. The result was put beyond doubt 11 minutes later when Matheus Cunha's cross was tapped in by Patrick Dorgu. Mason Mount thought he had made it three but Cunha was offside in the build-up.",

      "Mason Mount, who replaced Bruno Fernandes for the final stages, thought he had added a third goal, but it was ruled out for offside following a VAR check. Matheus Cunha had provided the pass to Mount, with the Brazil star earlier assisting Dorgu's strike.",
      "Alongside Mbeumo, Amad was also back from AFCON and he went straight into the starting XI, which saw Cunha and Benjamin Sesko drop out. The latter did not even make it on to the pitch with Mbeumo deployed as the false 9 by Michael Carrick.",
      "Zirkzee would have been expected to join them on the bench, but he was missing from their squad in its entirety amid January transfer links. However, BBC Sport stated that United sources had confirmed he was missing due to a knock, and nothing to do with ongoing transfer rumours.",

      "Both of those teams have been inconsistent this season - but Carrick is eager to make sure those performances become the norm under his tenure.",

      "Carrick will oversee his first game in charge since his appointment as head coach on Tuesday against Manchester City, who head into the game on the back of a 2-0 win against Newcastle. Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Casemiro, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have been recalled to the starting team. Carrick has picked a striker-less attack, selecting Amad, Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu to start against City.",

      "Michael Carrick will take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager this weekend(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick wasn't your typical English holding midfielder. A classy, controlling passer, for a while he was considered England's answer to Pep Guardiola. Nine years ago, Guardiola himself called Carrick \"one of the best holding midfielders I've ever seen in my life\".",
      "How far do the comparisons go? If Carrick was the English answer to Guardiola in midfield, could he also be the English answer to Guardiola in the dugout? It's not exactly a perfect comparison, admittedly. The current Manchester City manager never had a three-season spell in the Spanish second tier that ended with shrugs of shoulders all round.",
      "But there has often been a sense around Carrick that he has the talent to make a success of a managerial career, never more so than the early months at the Riverside when he supercharged a play-off push after inheriting a team shaping up for a relegation battle. Coming on the back of a three-game spell as a caretaker at Old Trafford that produced wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw with Chelsea, it hinted at promise.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The momentum has stalled since then, and it looked like Carrick was considering whether he wanted to continue pursuing a career in management, but when the club that shaped his career came calling last week, he couldn't say no.",
      "On Saturday lunchtime, he will walk out of the Old Trafford dugout and take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager. Next to him will be Guardiola, his stylistic equal as a player but a coach who has now amassed more than 1,000 games as a boss, almost all of it at the very elite level",
      "The contrast in experience is stark, and although Carrick, 44, ticked the box as a former United great, his CV and lack of experience weren't necessarily deserving of a 17-game spell in charge at Old Trafford, but he insists he feels ready for the challenge ahead.",
      "\"I've never really thought about it like that,\" he said. \"I just feel comfortable, I feel at home. Not comfortable in the fact that it's nice and everything's great, it's comfortable in the fact that I'm happy in my skin, happy in this role.",
      "\"I know what it takes, I worked closely with Jose [Mourinho] and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] for some time, so when I took over it felt quite a natural step. I understand the questions and that's how it is, you always question until you've achieved something. All I can say is I feel at home, I feel I'm ready and I'm really looking forward to getting to work.\"",
      "Carrick has taken over a squad visibly lacking in confidence and a team sitting seventh in the Premier League, with just one win in seven from a forgiving schedule. He stressed his arrival would act as a \"fresh start\", but games against City and Arsenal in his first two fixtures are a daunting beginning. Despite that, he believes the culture around the training ground and the attitude of the players has encouraged him this week.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days, and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything,\" he said. \"The players have been really good, willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put in better performances.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day to day, it's not something I sit here and talk about and a few words here and there and it makes it sound good, it's how you behave and what you end up doing day to day.",
      "\"That's something we've got to build, but certainly at the moment I feel it's a good place and the training ground has been a really good place and we need to make Old Trafford tomorrow an even better place with the help of the supporters as well and that's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates victory over Manchester City(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "As auditions go, Michael Carrick produced the perfect performance. Whether the leading role becomes his on a permanent basis in the summer remains to be seen. However, while Rome wasn't built in a day, leaving Manchester City's title hopes in ruins is not a bad way for Carrick to begin laying new foundations for the crumbling giants on the red side of Manchester.",
      "United were given a script to stick to by Carrick and his coaching staff, and promptly didn't fluff a single line, smashing City to smithereens. It has taken Carrick just one game to get the best performance of the season from a team which has often looked incapable of beating an egg. In one fell swoop, the interim manager has turned United into a side resembling one Sir Alex Ferguson used to produce. It left the great Pep Guardiola and his men humbled and humiliated.",
      "Rarely has there been an afternoon of more contrasting emotions for two managers. Here was one having the fairytale start, while leaving his rival trapped in a living nightmare. It's safe to say Guardiola will not be celebrating his 55th birthday on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United won't win the title this year, obviously. But Carrick and his side will take huge consolation from knowing that if City don't either, this might be the result that left their hopes of doing so in tatters. No wonder Carrick made a point of reminding people that there is still \"magic\" in the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "When he took charge as caretaker manager first time around, Carrick took on Thomas Tuchel, Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta, and remained unbeaten. Now he has put arguably the greatest manager of all time to the sword.",
      "The visitors were run ragged from start to finish. City had no answer to the energy, pace, enthusiasm and attitude of United. Second half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu did the damage, but the scoreline flattered Guardiola's side.",
      "United also had three goals ruled out, Amad hit the post, while Gianluigi Donnarumma's brilliance in the City goal helped limit the embarrassment.",
      "City are still without a league win in 2026. And the psychological damage this result could do to City might well leave them bereft of confidence.",
      "Michael Carrick celebrates as Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-0(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "It took just two minutes for United to set the tone when Harry Maguire met Bruno Fernandes's corner at the back post, but headed onto the crossbar from point-blank range.",
      "United should have gone ahead when a rare but glaring blunder from Rodri allowed Fernandes to pick out Mbeumo, but he allowed Abdukodir Khusanov to get back and dispossessed him at the crucial time. Amad and Fernandes had goals ruled out for offside as the home dominance continued.",
      "Guardiola had seen enough and made a double change at half time. He threw on Nico O'Reilly to strengthen his defence, and Rayan Cherki to add some spark to the attack. But O'Reilly was booked within three minutes for pulling back Amad, while Diogo Dalot zipped a ball across the face of Donnarumma's goal which no-one in red could finish off.",
      "It took a superb double save from Donnarumma to deny Amad and then Casemiro in quick succession. And Donnarumma was at his brilliant best again to keep out an effort from the stretching Mbeumo. But there was nothing he could do to stop Mbeumo from finishing off a lightning break from deep from United to get the lead they deserved.",
      "Carrick is not known for outward shows of emotion, but he couldn't contain himself. He jumped up and down, clenched his fists and celebrated with his staff. And when Dorgu converted a cross from substitute Matheus Cunha to double United's lead, City were dead and buried.",

      "\"You're at home, you've got players available, you could have had a man sent off. Timing, a little bit of luck, they've made the most of it. Take nothing away from them and I'm happy to give credit where it's due, they were fantastic today; but everybody just calm down. That's me saying that.\"",
      "United moved up to fourth place following their victory but will likely drop down the table once the teams around them have played. However, with several of those failing to build consistency, United could feasibly qualify for next season's Champions League, especially with no games in other competitions.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! ** Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page **",
      "Keane also spoke in detail about what United's ambitions should be and where Carrick's future lies - regardless of where they finish. He began: \"What's his target, to finish fourth? Fifth of course would get into Europe, but fourth is realistic.",
      "\"And you're sitting here thinking; 'That's what Manchester United should be thinking'. We shouldn't be scratching our heads and going; 'Can United finish fourth'? In the last week or two when we've been doing games and we've been disappointed in United, we've been saying; 'Fourth is a realistic target'.",
      "\"In the last few months we've been saying, because of the way the league is at the moment, there is a chance for United to finish fourth; it's not miracles we're talking about here.",
      "\"If he gets to fourth and doesn't get the job, it'll still leave Carrick to go and get a job somewhere- because people will go; 'Look at the way he's handled himself, he's been great, he's been cool, and their players have been positive'. Most people who would've took this job today would've played that way.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was one of several superb Manchester United performers in the derby. (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",

      "Michael Carrick gave little away in his Manchester United press conference(Image: )",
      "You could imagine the scene. Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox gathered around one of the TVs in Carrington's open-plan set-up, watching the latest Manchester United head coach speak to the media. It's been a moment of the week that the club's powerbrokers haven't exactly been looking forward to in recent weeks.",
      "But if Ruben Amorim was the press conference equivalent of Bazball, capable of going on the attack at any of the deliveries he would face, then Carrick was the next man in when all that unravels. The equivalent of losing an Ashes series 4-1 and deciding you now need someone to show the straightest of straight bats.",
      "That is exactly what Carrick did when the cameras rolled for the first press conference of his second spell in charge at Old Trafford. In November 2021, his pre-match press conferences were held on Zoom. In person, he would watch the ball carefully, then drop it safely at his feet.",
      "You could say the end of the Amorim era was categorised by press conference broadsides, but they were simply more spectacular at the end. Throughout his reign, he would throw in grenades when speaking to the media. From criticisms of players to calling his squad \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history\", he was a headline-making machine.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United didn't want any more of that. Wilcox quickly decided he wanted someone who knew the club to take over for the rest of the season. Carrick was the coach with the biggest upside, the one whose potential remains unexplored, but he is also a safe pair of hands.",
      "Across a little over four minutes and five questions while the cameras were rolling, the 44-year-old gave nothing away. Berrada and Wilcox would have been clinking glasses and exchanging high fives.",
      "There were a couple of questions in there that could have made headlines: his conversations with the owners and Roy Keane's unnecessary criticism of his wife. Carrick negotiated them both safely. He offered almost no insight into what he had said to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers and claimed he wasn't bothered by Keane's uncalled-for attack on Lisa.",
      "Even the questions about football were dealt with to try to avoid creating a story. Success would simply be improving. Improve the players and the rest will take care of itself. He also said that Wilcox and Berrada had laid no expectations for the rest of the season.",
      "Given United's ambitions clearly remain to qualify for Europe and that Darren Fletcher had laid down the Champions League as a challenge last Sunday, that seems unlikely. But Carrick's approach was to try and avoid heaping any unnecessary pressure on the squad.",
      "Carrick may have hinted at his approach to media dealings in his first response. Asked how he had found his first few days back and what it was like to be sitting in the media chair, he said: \"Two very different roles sat in this chair in front of you lot, it's very different to the role in coaching.\"",
      "Ultimately, the club's former midfielder will be judged on results, but you can imagine his bosses will be happy if he avoids making any noise as well. After the chaos of the Amorim era, what they need is stability. If Carrick provides that on and off the pitch, then they will be delighted.",

      "I think it's the right time to recall Maguire to the starting XI this weekend. Some may feel that Cunha should be dropped to accomodate Amad, but I'd give the Brazilian another roll of the dice in a big game.",
      "City are the favourites to win at Old Trafford.",
      "United vs City odds",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Carrick was appointed as United's head coach on Tuesday evening.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"I guess Michael Carrick's thinking will be that he has to steady the ship and from a personal point-of-view, he's got a great chance of staking a claim to take the job permanently.",
      "\"He's taken his own staff in there which I think was really important to do. The experience of Steve Holland and he obviously worked with Jonathan Woodgate before at Middlesbrough.",
      "\"Michael will be wanting to do a good job so he can stake a claim to take it long-term, that's what his motivation will be. Darren Fletcher managed one defeat and a draw so that didn't work but it'll be fascinating to see what Michael does differently to try and get the team up the table.",
      "\"They've got no cup competitions; the only target is to try and get into Europe and that's what he'll try to do. Man United probably didn't have a choice when it came to hiring another interim manager.",
      "\"They were probably in a situation where, and it bides them time, that Michael's connections will make his appointment go down well with the crowd. It gives Man United a chance to breathe and weigh up the situation to see where they go from now until the end of the season. Getting someone in from now until the end of the season was probably the only choice Man United had.",
      "\"Michael used to be at the same club as I was, Wallsend Boys Club. I never played with him and never worked with him, but I know him and have done little bits with him. He's very measured. I don't know what happened at Middlesbrough, but I know he tried to play front-foot, attacking football.",
      "\"It's a sensible appointment for Man United and it'll be really interesting to see what he can do with that team. It's purely going to be a game per week from now. He's got 17 games to get them into Europe.",
      "\"I think Michael will handle the pressure of the job like he did being a player there. He'll relish it. He's very calm, measured in what he does, and I think he'll be exactly the same as he was on the pitch.",
      "\"Michael isn't a magician, and there's no doubt that some of the players in that team are under-performing and have been for a while. It'll be fascinating to see whether he can get a tune out of them and drag them up the league.\"",
      "Michael Carrick spent just under a year out of the game after his stint as Manchester United caretaker, taking over at Middlesbrough for his first full-time managerial role. Carrick made an immediate impact, impressing Boro fans with a progressive style of play and guiding the club into the play-offs.",
      "Carrick took the job with Middlesbrough in a Championship relegation battle, but they ended the season by having a crack at promotion to the Premier League, with Carrick winning 16 of his first 23 league games.",
      "It began to unravel for Carrick in his second year in charge at the Riverside Stadium. The former United midfielder oversaw an eighth-placed finish, missing out on the play-offs, and there was regression in his third campaign, which resulted in a disappointing 10th-placed finish.",
      "Carrick was backed in the transfer market in the summer of 2024 but failed to meet expectations, which ultimately led to his dismissal. Carrick had been out of work since his departure from Middlesbrough, but now has the chance to manage the club that he represented for 464 games as a player.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "United are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach. Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions.",
      "It's understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window.",
      "United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.",
      "Carrick has just 17 games to oversee in the Premier League due to United's early exits from cup competitions, and the 44-year-old will try to steer the club into the Champions League.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Hello and welcome to our press conference blog.",
      "This will be Carrick's first chance to speak to the media since he was appointed interim head coach.",
      "United are expected to appoint a permanent replacement for Amorim in the summer. However, whether that plan changes if Carrick excels remains to be seen. Only qualification for next season's Champions League will be seen as a success between now and the end of the season. The road towards that starts tomorrow lunchtime.",

      "United take on Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday, looking to dent their city rivals' title ambitions. The game is Carrick's first match in charge after being appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season.",
      "The Reds come into the game on the back of two disappointing results following Ruben Amorim's exit. Following a 2-2 draw against Burnley in the league, United crashed out of the FA Cup at the first hurdle against Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "In the last two games, academy star Shea Lacey had been used by Darren Fletcher off the bench. The attacker, though, will be out of the City game after picking up a red card against Brighton.",
      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher were unused substitutes at Old Trafford. Bendito Mantato has also been used in the first team this season, playing over 15 minutes in the 1-1 draw against Wolves.",
      "However, on Friday night, Tom Curtis' men drew 2-2 at Fulham to maintain their three-point lead at the top of the table. Lacey bagged twice in the first 22 minutes to put United ahead before Farhaan Al-Wahid netted a brace to level the scoring.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The team selected at Motspur Park was missing several players, pointing to their inclusions at Old Trafford. Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson, Tyrell Malacia - who scored in the Under-21s' win over Wolves earlier this week - and Mantato were all absent.",
      "Lacey and Fletcher started alongside Diego Leon. Chido Obi came off the bench after an hour, despite scoring a brace in the 4-1 victory against Wolves.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the four players who missed Friday night's game will be in the United squad for the City game. Carrick will have the luxury of having Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back for the first time since they returned from the African Cup of Nations.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick will be feeling the weight of the job this afternoon when he takes charge of the Reds against Manchester City in the Premier League. Regardless of form or league positions, there is always an expectation on United to pick up a result in this game.",
      "Adding to the pressure is the fact that this is Carrick's first game as interim head coach since returning to the club. In defence, it is expected the Reds' new manager will lean towards experience for a game of this magnitude. Harry Maguire could partner Lisandro Martinez in central defence.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sitting in front of them is likely to be Casemiro. Ordinarily you would think Kobbie Mainoo would be in the deeper role next to Casemiro but Carrick's recent comments about the midfielder being better suited to attacking and his lack of minutes this season perhaps suggest Manuel Ugarte will keep his place in midfield. That means the Bruno Fernandes will occupy the attacking midfield role.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's return is a very welcome boost for Carrick. It was a disappointing AFCON for United's top goalscorer but he could be given the nod over Amad on the right.",
      "Matheus Cunha has done well cutting in from the left side and he will be hoping to provide striker Benjamin Sesko with plenty of chances. The Slovenian has hit a purple patch recently and Carrick will give him the opportunity to continue that form against City.",

      "October 23, 2011, remains etched in memory as one of Manchester United's bleakest moments - a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Manchester City on their own turf at Old Trafford. In the aftermath, United icon Wayne Rooney found himself at the centre of a storm after it emerged he'd been socialising with City players following the drubbing. Now, the England legend has finally explained his reasoning.",
      "What was anticipated to be a closely-fought encounter turned into one of the most memorable derby victories in Premier League history under Roberto Mancini's guidance. City's star-studded lineup featured the talents of Yaya Touré, David Silva and Sergio Agüero, among others.",
      "The fixture marked an unprecedented moment — the first Manchester derby where both sides occupied the top two positions in the league standings. Despite United fielding the likes of Wayne Rooney, Nani and prime Ashley Young, they were utterly overwhelmed by a dominant City performance.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"After something like that I'd usually just go home. But I had a birthday party. Joe Hart, Gareth Barry and a few of the City players were invited to my birthday party,\" he revealed on BBC's The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "\"You've got family, friends, everyone who's made their own plans to come. I was like, 'I can't cancel it' so I went.",
      "\"We've got the United lads, some of the City lads sat there. I think it was me, Crouchy [Peter Crouch], Harty [Joe Hart] - we all got up and did a song of Backstreet Boys.",

      "This game was also where Mario Balotelli produced this iconic celebration(Image: Photo by Sam Bagnall/AMA/Corbis via Getty Image)",
      "Mario Balotelli broke the deadlock on 22 minutes with a sublime side-footed strike into the bottom right corner, before unveiling his now-legendary 'Why Always Me?' celebration. United trailed 1-0 at the interval, but matters deteriorated when Jonny Evans saw red shortly after the break.",
      "Balotelli doubled his tally on the hour mark, before Sergio Aguero extended the visitors' advantage to 3-0 ten minutes later. Darren Fletcher, now the club's interim manager, pulled one back for United on 81 minutes, but the closing stages proved catastrophic for the hosts.",
      "It was a massive win for City(Image: Photo credit should read ANDREW YATES/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Edin Dzeko netted twice and David Silva also found the net as City plundered three goals in just four minutes, twisting the knife for United's supporters and players alike.",
      "Reflecting on the outcome, Rooney commented: \"I think that was a big moment for City back then because you could feel City coming up and getting closer to us.",
      "\"But to come to Old Trafford and win 6-1, I think that was a statement. I remember being on the pitch and it was horrible. It was like in the second half, just felt like it was goal after goal, and you're just like, 'oh, get me off this pitch'.\"",

      "Just 19 years old at the time, Veseli was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at Manchester City, but he found first-team opportunities at the Etihad Stadium hard to come by.",
      "After three-and-a-half years and not yet having made a first-team appearance, Veseli made the decision to leave. His next destination was not only a surprising one, but also close by too.",
      "Despite Roberto Mancini wanting Veseli to sign a new contract, the desire to progress his football career led him to sign for Manchester United, with Sir Alex Ferguson playing a key role in the defender's decision.",
      "Veseli's former agent Adam Bouskouchi previously said: \"These days, Manchester City are chasing titles and major trophies. It is difficult for them to have faith in youth because they obviously feel experience is the best way for them to get where they want to go.",
      "\"But that attitude didn't help Freddie, who just felt like he wasn't progressing. Freddie spoke with several clubs, here and abroad. But he wants to be a top player in England.",

      "\"Mancini would ask me all the time what was happening. I carried on playing. I played against United’s reserves who had Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager. United had a lot of first-teamers, we had reserves only and we drew 1-1. Fergie was there watching. I had a really good game.\"",
      "However, it was before the legendary Scotsman's initial intervention that the wheels started to turn on a potential move to United. It was a chance encounter with then-United assistant Rene Meulensteen at a pub while Veseli was picking up his girlfriend that the pair discussed his situation at City.",
      "It was a chance encounter at a pub that initially sparked Veseli's move to Man United(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",

      "Having played for five clubs in five years, Veseli now plays for Serie B side Sudtirol. The two Manchester clubs, meanwhile, meet at Old Trafford on Saturday, with City aiming to do the double over their rivals having beat them 3-0 at the Etihad earlier this season.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",

      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Nuno and Frank clashed in El Sackico and the latter came off definitively worse.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are still absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to…",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like five points away, that deficit cut down after the Hammers visited Dr. Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Is losing at home to West Ham more damaging than being beaten while holding an Arsenal cup for Thomas Frank? Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "Thomas Frank lost El Sackico to actual Nuno Espírito Santo and Arne Slot isn’t far behind in the sack race after extending Liverpool’s rank unbeaten run to 12 games.",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is likely to have “two or three games” left to prove himself at Spurs ahead of their match against West Ham.",
      "Tottenham v West Ham this weekend is also Frank v Nuno in El Sackico, sending us on a miserable jaunt down Sackico memory lane. Nuno comes up a lot.",
      "Manchester United need to take advantage of the latest ‘blow’ for Crystal Palace, who ‘face losing another key player’ after Marc Guehi this month.",
      "Harry Maguire has been “really impressed” by Michael Carrick’s impact in his short time in charge of Man Utd."

      "Michael Carrick, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger just made Ruben Amorim, Pep Guardiola and Nicky Butt among many others look really rather silly indeed.",
      "But there was justice at Old Trafford for one former Arsenal manager…",
      "",
      "1) It will presumably and obviously be after his post-game debrief with Sir Alex Ferguson, but Michael Carrick must be looking forward to a congratulatory phone call from the delirious Arsene Wenger on his 5-0 thrashing of Manchester City.",
      "",
      "2) The phrase that kept cropping up to explain how Manchester United landed on Carrick as their five-month safety blanket over closest contender Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was “more hands-on”.",
      "It would be foolish to draw conclusions on that assessment after Carrick’s first 90 minutes in charge, even before taking into account how Solskjaer inflicted this exact result and scoreline on Pep Guardiola at Old Trafford six years ago, down to the 11-7 shot count.",
      "These are not really the games on which Carrick ought to be judged. Ruben Amorim beat Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle this season but paid in part for mediocre displays, draws and defeats against teams in the bottom half. Those are the fixtures upon which this Champions League qualification charge must be built.",
      "But what a result and what a performance, indelibly engineered by a coach determined and talented enough to make this work. The game plan and patterns of play were clear, the tactics were exquisite, the team selection was exemplary and the substitutions were superb. Carrick does indeed appear to be at the wheel.",
      "",
      "3) The biggest yet most predictable call was the reinstatement of Kobbie Mainoo to the starting line-up for the first time this season in a game not against Grimsby.",
      "Carrick referred to the 20-year-old’s experience in games of such magnitude as part of the reason for his inclusion and Mainoo did “thrive” as the Manchester United manager predicted, excelling in a midfield two alongside the brilliant Casemiro in front of a back four.",
      "That was the template for the club’s best defensive display of the entire campaign. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox were right all along.",
      "Patrick Dorgu didn’t look particularly anxious either when scoring the nerve-settling second. The whole experience felt like a proper cleansing of the Amorim era, the latest in a long line of turned corners in this infernal Manchester United maze.",
      "",
      "4) With that said, it was funny to see something return alongside Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Casemiro, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Manchester United starting line-up: the team leaks.",
      "It did Manchester City no good, of course. But they’ll probably want to clamp down on that again soon.",
      "",
      "5) There is a flipside to that coin; Manchester City were atrocious.",
      "Three narrow offside calls and the excellence of Gianluigi Donnarumma spared them a more humiliating shot of the Old Trafford scoreboard as a makeshift defence eventually combusted, the midfield was bypassed and an imposing attack collapsed in on itself.",
      "Manchester City were the better team for 20, maybe 25 minutes either side of half time and even then were held at arm’s length by a vulnerable opponent who not only comfortably contained them, but posed a far greater and more consistent threat.",
      "A four-game winless run at the stage of the season when they generally reach their most imposing form would be damning even if they weren’t about to pluck a second of the league’s best players to make themselves the world’s biggest spenders in this January transfer window.",
      "Much like Antoine Semenyo can’t be a one-man solution to their problems going forward, Marc Guehi alone is no panacea to those defensive issues.",
      "",
      "6) There are injuries in that backline, but the Manchester United opener highlighted systemic and structural issues too.",
      "Within seconds of Rayan Cherki lofting in Manchester City’s latest imprecise, actively damaging set piece, the hosts had launched a three-on-two attack from which Mbeumo would score.",
      "It was his flick which created it after Maguire headed Cherki’s delivery back at him, isolating the Frenchman who was guarding a good 20 yards of space – and with it any prospect of the sort of quick counter Manchester United had leaned on all game.",
      "For Cherki to be deployed as that screen was amateurish and whether Manchester United’s jumble of coaches highlighted it as a potential point of interest before the game or the players sensed an impromptu opportunity to target it, that failure is on Guardiola and his staff.",
      "",
      "7) The visitors did not look much more stable in open play. Even beyond their two permissible United goals and three others that were disallowed, Manchester United had the game’s better chances.",
      "Maguire clattered the bar with a header from a corner. Casemiro should have scored from the rebound of Amad’s saved shot. Dorgu and Mbeumo tested Donnarumma from crosses, both of which were aimed at Manchester City’s right-hand side.",
      "Matheus Nunes cannot possibly be so important to this team that his absence reduces them to such a quivering wreck.",
      "The starkest sight was of Rodri drowning in midfield, passing the ball to opponents on the edge of his own area and being booked for pulling back Dorgu in the centre circle for his only foul of the entire game. Perhaps he needs a refresher course.",
      "",
      "8) It was probably a game too far for the encouraging Alleyne-Khusanov partnership, especially flanked with unfamiliar full-backs.",
      "Nico O’Reilly was booked within a couple of minutes of his half-time introduction for the former – which meant he was restricted against Matheus Cunha for the second goal – while Rico Lewis really struggled on the right and picked up a yellow himself soon after.",
      "Putting Rodri in front of that defence, with Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva as nominal runners tracking back, certainly felt like a choice. Nico Gonzalez might have usurped this current version of his midfield compatriot in terms of importance to Manchester City.",
      "",
      "9) The best part of a really quite uneventful and tiresome first half was Anthony Taylor shaking his head like an exasperated parent after watching Maguire shepherd the ball out for a goal kick before gently placing Bernardo into that dip between the pitch and the advertising hoardings.",
      "",
      "10) It is difficult to quantify but Maguire instinctively feels like the world’s best New Manager’s First Game player. The man oozes back-to-basics, keep-it-compact, fresh-start energy.",
      "He even treated the supporters to a trademark marauding run past the halfway line on the hour mark, just after Casemiro dispossessed Erling Haaland with a stunning wraparound sliding tackle. Imagine even contemplating that sentence under Amorim. It is mad what a little shot of confidence and clarity can do for a player.",
      "",
      "11) It was a particularly chastening experience for Haaland, who taken off in a triple substitution at 2-0 down with ten minutes remaining. Guardiola entrusted Divine Mukasa with closing that deficit in the second Premier League appearance of his career.",
      "Those 14 Haaland touches can be compartmentalised if they are accompanied by a goal but Manchester United stymied and stifled him exceptionally well. That absurd start to the season has now bled into one goal in seven games.",
      "That, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt might be interested to learn, is also four wins in five meetings against Haaland for Lisandro Martinez, and a second clean sheet. The speed with which he nipped ahead of the static Norwegian to intercept one pass suggested that even if Haaland could “pick Martinez up and run with him”, he’d never get close enough.",
      "",
      "12) Gary Neville calling Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes “problematic” on commentary felt a bit harsh.",
      "",
      "13) Mbeumo’s flicks were particularly potent. That combination of clever movement to pull a defender out of position, followed by a deft touch to a team-mate, wreaked havoc with Manchester City.",
      "It formed the basis of how the first offside goal and his own opener were constructed.",
      "And there is little point commending the range, weight and choice of Fernandes’ passing. For a player who bears almost the entire creative burden of the team at times, to so consistently make the right decision under pressure is ludicrous. Manchester United will not replace him easily.",
      "",
      "14) Carrick’s pre-match message to the omitted Cunha and Benjamin Sesko that “finishing the game is even more important these days” was realised in stunning fashion.",
      "Sesko never made it off the bench but Cunha’s impact was immediate and obvious. His first touch was a flying block on the edge of his own box from a Bernardo shot, then the Brazilian generated an assist out of nothing with his push to the byline and glorious delivery for Dorgu, who caught Lewis napping.",
      "As Carrick said, and as rarely seemed the case under Amorim, “we’ve got a good squad of players”. Manchester United might just have a manager capable of using it properly on a game-by-game basis.",
      "",
      "15) The contrast with Manchester City was evident. Cherki was a slight improvement on Foden in the minutes after his introduction but soon settled into the general rule of his team’s mediocrity, by which point the only attacking option Guardiola could call upon from his bench was either Mukasa or, at a push, Tijanji Reijnders.",
      "While Manchester United had a £74m unused substitute, Manchester City had basically no Plan B to an already flawed Plan A.",
      "That chequebook might not be closed even when Guehi shuffles through the door. Arsenal are firmly in their heads.",
      "",
      "16) Six offsides is the most Manchester United have had in a game since mid-February, and they scored from three of those attacks. It will be interesting to see if Carrick and his lambasted coaching team come up with something as effective against those low blocks.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has heaped praise on Michael Carrick for bringing back the “United DNA” to Old Trafford in a 2-0 win over Man City on Saturday.",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane insists that it would “probably be no” if the Red Devils asked him to help before they appoint a new permanent manager.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has heaped praise on Michael Carrick for bringing back the “United DNA” to Old Trafford in a 2-0 win over Man City on Saturday.",
      "The Red Devils were brilliant against the Citizens as Carrick claimed a well-earned victory in his first game as Man Utd’s new interim manager.",
      "Carrick was given the job until the end of the season, when Man Utd are expected to announce a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim, and he aced his first test.",
      "Many former players have claimed that Man Utd are yet to play with ‘United DNA’ since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club as manager in 2013.",
      "But Rooney was impressed by Carrick reverting to that type of football in an impressive victory over Man City, in which Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu scored the goals in a result which could have been even more comfortable.",
      "Rooney told BBC Sport: “Obviously I’m absolutely delighted. I think the team spirit, the work rate, the energy, everything about that team was fantastic today. I’m absolutely buzzing for the players, for the fans – the fans have been starved of that over the last few years. I know it’s only one performance but I think everyone could see how exciting that team can be.",
      "READ: Guehi to Liverpool, Neves to Man Utd among six forced hijack transfers to save this January window",
      "“You hear everyone, especially us as ex-players, talk about the United DNA and that has just shown what it is. Work rate off the ball, wingers getting back filling in and helping out the full-backs.",
      "“And the goals; crosses in the box and desire to get on the end of it. The first goal, counter-attack, sitting in and breaking fast – that is the United DNA and that was what we’ve been missing. And hopefully this continues.",
      "“The work rate, the shape, the organisation of Manchester United today, the desire to get back and double up and help your teammates out and tackle and run without the ball, as quickly backwards and you do forwards. I think that was really evident today.”",
      "Goalscorer Mbeumo thought the atmosphere at Old Trafford was “unbelievable” against Man City and claims Man Utd “used the energy of the fans” to win.",
      "When asked if it was the most special day he’s had at Man Utd so far, Mbeumo replied: “I think it’s one of them. Scoring in front of this stand is unbelievable. Derby is even more and like Licha [Martinez] said, we used the energy of the fans today. This place was unbelievable today.”",

      "On there being a lot of change while at AFCON, Mbeumo added: “When I came back a lot of things changed. I think we have a very good group. We always stick together. We have a fantastic unit, so it is unbelievable.",
      "“It is a bit of everything. It is not easy because we only had three days. Because we are all together, we all want to win the same way with the same aim.”",
      "Mbeumo’s team-mate Lisandro Martinez, added: “Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being here with the fans, with the team we really know how we suffer during the season. But the only way is putting the face here and showing here who we are. Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.",
      "“I think one important thing that Michael Carrick said was ‘use the energy of the people’ and today I think we did it and when we are together like this it is impossible to lose at home.",
      "“When you play against these kind of players, the team defend. Not just one or two players. Today we defend so good, we were compact all the times. And then you have the confidence to go to the duels. Today you feel a different energy when you see the eyes of the players. Today the team won and that is the most important thing.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "Michael Carrick, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger just made Ruben Amorim, Pep Guardiola and Nicky Butt among many others look really rather silly indeed.",
      "Man Utd legend Roy Keane insists that it would “probably be no” if the Red Devils asked him to help before they appoint a new permanent manager.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",
      "Former Premier League striker Troy Deeney reckons Man Utd should stop “bowing” to Sir Alex Ferguson as the legendary manager “doesn’t work there”.",

      "Earlier this week, a report claimed the Red Devils have ‘decided’ that they will not make any signings in this month’s transfer window, but this may not be the case.",
      "It is understood that Man Utd have limited funds after spending £230m on signings in the summer, with the potential exit of Bruno Fernandes and others required to boost their upcoming spending.",
      "After fixing their goalkeeper problem and strengthening their attack, Man Utd’s next priority will be to overhaul their midfield and they are expected to make at least one signing in this department this year.",
      "In the summer, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and/or Adam Wharton could be their marquee signings, but they could opt for a short-term solution with a loan or cut-price deal in this window.",

      "Regarding this window, journalist Ben Jacobs revealed on Friday that the Premier League giants have a “secret midfielder” on their radar.",
      "“There is one secret midfielder that Manchester United held talks with in the last 24 hours. Hopefully, I’ll be able to report a few more details in the coming days,” Jacobs said on The Football Terrace podcast.",
      "Jacobs continued: “It is just an indication that they are not exactly shutting up shop. They are in talks with at least one midfielder for a loan on a short-term deal. Whether or not it develops, let’s see.",
      "“I’m not yet in a position where I can divulge the name. The midfielder would only be available until the end of the season on a loan. They have got Premier League experience and are currently playing outside of England.”",

      "He added: “They have made an enquiry. It just shows you that they are not discounting backing Michael Carrick, much like his own role, with something from now until the end of the season.",
      "“It would not stagger anyone if they didn’t do anything, but they are definitely going to use this window time to explore opportunities, particularly in central midfield.”",
      "You can be forgiven if you instinctively assume that Jacobs is talking about Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves because the £20m-rated midfielder is claimed to be on Man Utd’s radar, but the reporter insists the player in question is “currently playing in Europe”.",
      "“The name I’m referencing is not Ruben Neves,” he confirmed. “I note the player is currently playing in Europe, not Saudi Arabia.”",
      "Instead, we think Jacobs is referring to former Chelsea midfielder Loftus-Cheek, who has spent the last couple of years playing for Serie A giants AC Milan.",
      "This is largely because a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk has revealed that Man Utd, along with several other Premier League clubs, have been ‘offered’ Loftus-Cheek with the view to a loan deal.",
      "Their report adds: ‘Intermediaries who have been sounding out potential moves have suggested Milan would be willing to let him leave on-loan with an option.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in need of a rest and thankfully for City they have a rare off week before a home game against Wolves.",
      "Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "With only three days of preparation, United's new head coach successfully brought back 4-4-2 and delivered a statement performance that reminded Neville of the club he used to play for.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville added.",
      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener came from a devastating counter-attack and wonderful combination play with captain Bruno Fernandes, no longer restricted to playing as a holding midfielder.",
      "\"I got quite emotional when that goal went in, because I thought, 'that's what I have been asking for, it's what everyone in this ground's been asking for'.",
      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes was Eric \"Cantona-esque\" back playing in the No 10 role after Ruben Amorim had so stubbornly stuck with him as a deep midfielder.",
      "\"That's where he's got to play, be near to goal, be where you can hurt them, because he's a great player. We don't want to see him back in a midfield two in front of a back three.",
      "\"Is that where we want to see him? No, it's definitely not right. I just saw so many things that reminded me of what this club plays like, what their DNA is, what they should be.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always said Manchester United's system is such, you have a forward and then you have a No 10, it can be [Dwight] Yorke, it can be Cantona, it can be [Wayne] Rooney, it can be [Carlos] Tevez, it can be [Dimitar] Berbatov. Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",
      "Despite his delight over the manner of the win, Neville said Carrick's aim should be handing over the team in the best shape possible for the next coach.",

      "Michael Carrick has refuted suggestions that Manchester United is a soulless club and says he's returned to a \"magic\" at the club's Carrington training complex.",
      "The former United midfielder returned to the club - where he had also previously held an assistant coaching role and been caretaker manager in 2021 - this week after replacing Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese left the club after 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Middlesbrough boss is the 11th different person to sit in the hotseat at Old Trafford since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Another managerial switch has added to fan discontent with protests planned for next month.",
      "Asked whether he felt the club is now soulless within their current slump, Carrick said: \"I certainly don't think it's soulless. I think there's a magic around this place. I feel it and I feel at home straight away, coming into the building.",
      "\"Results and sometimes from the outside things look a little bit different, but it certainly doesn't feel majorly different on the inside.",
      "\"Part of my role and the responsibility is shaping what we want to look like going forward as a group. What happens on the pitch and the tactical side and the performances is one thing, but certainly the culture as well and how we think, how we act, how we behave, what it means to us to be here - that's something that is part of my responsibility to spread in the right way.\"",
      "Carrick adds that player mood has been positive and that the training ground has been in a good place.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything. The players have been really good.",
      "\"[The players are] willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put on better performances. That's the feeling I've got.",
      "\"The support staff and everyone is desperate to do well and we need to channel that.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day-to-day. It's not something I sit here and talk about - a few words here and there and it makes it sound good.",
      "\"It's how you behave and what you end up doing day-to-day. That's something we've got to build but certainly at the moment, I feel it's a good place and the training ground's been a really good place.",
      "\"We need to make Old Trafford an even better place with the help of the supporters as well. That's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",

      "Friday 16 January 2026 18:08, UK",
      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth in the first half of the season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo provides another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right across his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different and his penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
