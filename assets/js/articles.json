      "Liverpool will win the Premier League title by two points, if the analysts have their predictions right. It's been a largely promising start to the new season for Arne Slot, as the Reds currently top the table after six games.",
      "However, the current campaign hasn't been without its teething problems for the defending champions. The Anfield side relied on last-minute goals to seal the deal against Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Arsenal and Burnley, while their 2-1 win over rivals Everton was cagey to say the very least.",
      "Liverpool hit their first stumbling block of the season after suffering a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park at the weekend, with Ismaila Sarr opening the scoring, Federico Chiesa equalising with three minutes left to play, and Eddie Nketiah stealing the show for the hosts seven minutes into stoppage time.",
      "Regardless, the Reds still hold a two-point lead over Arsenal heading into game week seven of the Premier League, when they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. According to the Opta Analyst, that's the way that the current season will wrap up next May.",
      "That's because the experts have Liverpool to finish with 78.56 points this season, to Arsenal's 76.10. While Mikel Arteta has guided the Gunners to four wins from their opening six thus far, a loss to Liverpool and a 1-1 stalemate with Manchester City sees them trail the league leaders ever so slightly.",
      "As per the analysts, City, Crystal Palace and Brighton will make up the rest of the top five come season's end, with 67, 63 and 58 points respectively. While Sir Jim Ratcliffe will hope that Ruben Amorim is able to turn the tide with Manchester United this term, the club's predicted outlook is far less positive.",
      "That's because Opta pin the Red Devils at 14th when the current campaign reaches its conclusion. Amorim has suffered a turbulent start to his tenure with United, currently occupying the spot they are forecast to finish in as a result.",
      "After suffering an embarrassing 15th-place finish last term, Amorim received the full backing of the United board and was afforded a full pre-season tour to fine-tune his team this time out. But it appears as though the £200million plus which has been spent on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko may have been better allocated elsewhere.",
      "That's because United have managed just two wins from their opening six matches this term, also suffering defeat at the hands of Arsenal and rivals City. Meanwhile, 11 goals conceded this early on should also be a major red flag for Amorim, who is still yet to utilise summer signing Senne Lammens over Altay Bayindir in goal.",
      "With an in-form Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to play in their next five outings, things could get far worse before they start to improve at Old Trafford, and by that point, Amorim may no longer be at the helm considering the pressure he will currently be facing.",
      "At the other end of the table, a newly-promoted trio of Sunderland, Leeds United and Burnley were favoured by many football fans and pundits to return to the Championship for 2026/27. However, Opta currently only see the Clarets facing relegation for those three sides after impressive starts for the Black Cats and the Peacocks.",
      "While Burnley currently sit 18th in the league standings with one win, one draw and four losses to their name, Leeds have climbed all the way to 11th thanks to two wins, draws and losses apiece. Sunderland, meanwhile, have excelled after making the step-up and a summer of big spending, currently sat fifth in the Premier League thanks to three wins, two draws and a solitary loss.",
      "As it stands, Opta have West Ham to finish 18th with 37.45 points after a dismal start to the season, Burnley to take 19th with 33.94 points, and Wolves to finish rock bottom with 33.75 - hardly surprising considering Vitor Pereira has already suffered five losses this term.",
      "Here's how the Opta Analyst sees the Premier League finishing this year:",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Zinedine Zidane has previously claimed he would need to master English before considering the Manchester United job. The legendary Frenchman has been repeatedly touted for the managerial role at Old Trafford.",
      "Those rumours have resurfaced again, with Ruben Amorim's position appearing precarious among fans following United's 3-1 loss to Brentford at the weekend. The Portuguese manager has suffered defeat in 17 of his 33 Premier League matches and is yet to achieve consecutive victories at the club.",
      "With fifth-placed Sunderland visiting on Saturday, former Red Devils legend Gary Neville believes the struggling boss could face the axe should the newly-promoted side claim all three points.",
      "Though Amorim is understood to maintain backing from the Old Trafford hierarchy, speculation continues to swirl around his future – and potential successors. Zidane has consistently been mentioned as a prime candidate for the role, although he has expressed doubts previously.",
      "Speaking about the prospect of managing in Manchester, he told L'Equipe in 2022: \"Would I want to go to Manchester? I understand English, but I'm not completely fluent in it.",
      "\"I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play in order to win, it is a global context. I know what I need to win.\"",
      "Despite being currently unemployed, the Frenchman is heavily tipped to take over the France national team after the 2026 World Cup. Emmanuel Petit, a former teammate of Zidane and a Premier League legend, expressed his doubts about the ex-Juventus star's possible move to Manchester in 2024.",
      "He said: \"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "Petit added: \"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid. I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

      "Another weekend defeat for Manchester United has left head coach Ruben Amorim under increasing pressure, and he has plenty of time to take in the 3-1 reverse at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium. With no midweek European responsibilities this season, there's just one more match - at home to Sunderland - before the October international break and, perhaps, decision time.",
      "United sit 14th in the table after Saturday's defeat, handed to them by an Igor Thiago brace and a late Brentford third from Mathias Jensen. Only three teams have conceded more than Amorim's men this term, and all three are in the relegation zone.",
      "There were some complaints, not least at Nathan Collins avoiding a red card for a foul on Bryan Mbeumo, but United need to look forward not back. Those looking on from the outside, however, have begun to argue the clock is ticking as far as Amorim is concerned.",
      "If Amorim survives the international break, a tasty fixture awaits on the other side. United are due to head to Anfield on October 19, by which point Arne Slot's Liverpool team could have been knocked off top spot in the table.",
      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville was at a loss when it came to explaining Ruben Amorim's decision to use Mason Mount out of position on Saturday. Mount played part of the Brentford game at left wing-back, with the midfielder replacing Luke Shaw late on and forced to cover after Patrick Dorgu left the field.",
      "\"There's sticking to your plan, and then there's your coach that's got an idea and making sure that he delivers that idea and not flip-flopping with his idea with players, which can sometimes undermine what you're trying to achieve,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast. \"But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back – and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes of the game – it starts to look awful.",
      "\"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back. I'm sorry, it just can't happen. I can't watch Mason Mount play left wing-back in a football team. I struggled at times to watch him in his natural position, but actually putting him out there on the left wing, is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is one of the bosses mentioned as a potential successor to Amorim, and he picked up another win against Liverpool on Saturday. After the victory, he was asked about a potential Old Trafford switch - and kept his cards close to his chest.",
      "\"I follow all the rumours – and that’s all there is – neutrally and completely relaxed,\" Glasner told Austrian media. \"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Palace are the only unbeaten team in the Premier League after ending rivals Liverpool's perfect record. Eddie Nketiah scored a late winner at Selhurst Park, helping lift Glasner's side to third in the table.",
      "Former England star Alan Shearer has doubled down on his belief that Nathan Collins should have seen red for his foul on Bryan Mbeumo on Saturday. Not only that, but he anticipates an apology from PGMOL chief Howard Webb.",
      "\"Well, I'm told that was the match centre, that put that out, that's what the VAR relayed to each other and put that out,\" Shearer said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"But I'm pretty certain, you will probably, no you will see Howard Webb coming out to say, 'That's another one we got wrong.' There's no way he's going for the ball.",
      "\"He clearly pulls him back, Mbeumo would've put it in the back of the net – it's a ridiculous decision, it's clearly a massive error by the referee and the VAR again.\"",

      "If Manchester United decide to part with Ruben Amorim and appoint Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, they could inadvertently aid Liverpool's pursuit of Marc Guehi. Glasner, 51, recently handed Arne Slot his first defeat of the season after Palace clinched a 2-1 victory with goals from Ismaila Sarr and Eddie Nketiah, either side of Federico Chiesa's equaliser.",
      "With Palace sitting pretty in second place and maintaining an unbeaten start to the new campaign, Glasner's reputation is on the rise. Meanwhile, United suffered a 3-1 away loss to Brentford, piling more pressure onto Amorim.",
      "Post-match, Glasner artfully dodged questions about recent rumours linking him with a move to United. If United were able to sway the FA Cup winner to Old Trafford, they could find themselves helping Liverpool's pursuit of Guehi.",
      "TalkSPORT recently claimed Glasner is part of a three-man shortlist also featuring ex-England manager Sir Gareth Southgate and Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola. If United were to secure Glasner, it could speed up Guehi's departure from Selhurst Park, much to Liverpool's advantage.",
      "Liverpool are understood to be keen on signing Guehi next summer when he will be available as a free agent. The England international is reportedly still eager for a move to Anfield, despite a transfer deadline day deal to the Reds falling through at the last minute.",
      "Whilst there's been scant suggestion Guehi might reverse his stance and pen fresh terms at Selhurst Park, Glasner's departure during this season or when his own deal expires next summer would most likely kill off any slim chance of him staying in south London.",
      "Palace are presently enjoying a stunning campaign, climbing to second spot in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Amorim is struggling in 14th place following the defeat to Brentford.",
      "Having ended last season in 15th last term, the United chief currently holds a victory rate of merely 27.3 per cent, which is similar to former West Ham United boss Graham Potter, who got the axe and was succeeded by Nuno Espirito-Santo at the weekend.",
      "When Glasner was quizzed about recent speculation connecting him to United by Austrian publication Kicker, he chose not to clarify his stance. He said: \"I follow all the rumours. That's all there is. Neutrally and completely relaxed, (I) focus on the daily work with my players and coaches and try to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Slot endured a massive setback in his centre-back ranks ahead of the defeat to Palace. Following an outstanding debut for the club, summer recruit Giovanni Leoni ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament during the 2-1 triumph over Southampton in the League Cup.",
      "The Italian will be sidelined through injury for a year, as Slot confirmed during his pre-match press conference ahead of the defeat to Palace. Whilst some might have expected the injury to trigger a January pursuit of Guehi, the Dutchman insisted it won't alter Liverpool's winter transfer window strategy, unless further injuries occur.",
      "He said: \"That all depends on whether we get more injuries, yes or no, and if there's a chance in the market - all the answers I always give. I would not prefer to go to 24/25 players. Also, if it is ever a situation where I lead a team that has four or five injuries throughout the whole season, it might be a bit smarter to go to 24/25, but recent history showed that [we have a good record] until now.",
      "\"We don't have five or six injuries at the same time throughout the whole season. If that would be the situation, then we would end up with 15/16 players and that would normally be difficult.\"",

      "Manchester United are confronting a 'major problem' regarding Marcus Rashford's future next summer, according to former Manchester City financial adviser Stefan Borson. Rashford, 27, who has three years remaining on his contract at United, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan in July after Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim made it clear he was not in his plans.",
      "The Catalan club hold the option to secure Rashford in a permanent move worth £30million in 2026. Following his impressive displays since the turn of the September international break, Barcelona are eager to sign the England international but for a discounted fee in the region of £26m.",
      "And Borson believes that it's a headache for United because the club do not have command of the situation. He told Football Insider: \"The player is going to end up boxing Manchester United in. I think it's clear that United obviously want to sell the player. I mean, you just loaned him out. Where are we going to get to next summer?",
      "\"Whatever he does, whether he plays well or whether he's mediocre, whether he's patchy, you get to next summer and there's one bidder on the table and the player says he only wants to go to Barcelona. Well, in that scenario, they may well get him for £25m.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a big issue for Manchester United because it is very hard to see where the upside is.",
      "\"You're not going to bring him back unless there's a change of manager and he's very keen, which must be unlikely. Not so much the first bit, but the second bit.",
      "\"So, he's not coming back, and he's almost certain to say he wants to go to Barcelona if Barcelona want to sign him, so you're negotiating against yourself.\"",
      "Rashford struggled initially following his season-long loan switch from United to the Catalan giants during the summer transfer window, but has found his groove since netting for England whilst away on international duty.",
      "The forward has now contributed either a goal or assist in each of his previous five outings for Barcelona.",
      "His maiden goals for Barca arrived against Newcastle United in the Champions League this month, whilst he has provided one assist across his last quartet of La Liga fixtures.",
      "On Sunday, Rashford delivered the cross for Jules Kounde to nod home Barcelona's leveller as Hansi Flick's team fought back to defeat Real Sociedad courtesy of Robert Lewandowski's second-half decider.",

      "Wayne Rooney has claimed that Florian Wirtz is \"damaging the balance\" of Liverpool at present. The attacking-midfielder was snapped up by the Reds this summer in a groundbreaking £116million deal with Bayer Leverkusen after impressing for club and country.",
      "However, the 22-year-old has failed to impress on English soil thus far, raising questions about his suitability for the Premier League. With 10 goals and 13 assists to his name for Die Werkself last term, coupled with his at-the-time club-record price tag, expectations were high for Wirtz as he arrived at Anfield.",
      "But with six league appearances to his name this season and no return in terms of goals or assists, football fans worldwide have began to wonder whether the talent will turn out as a tremendous waste of money. As for Rooney, the Manchester United legend believes that he will come good in time, although he may be throwing a spanner in the works in Arne Slot's set-up at present.",
      "Speaking on his Wayne Rooney Show on YouTube, the player-turned-pundit said: \"It's been tough for him. I don't think there's any denying that and he'll be searching deep within himself to fix that and trying to figure it out.",
      "\"I think he's played okay and better, but I think when you sign so many players like Liverpool have - and this is not normal for Liverpool. Liverpool don't normally do this, and they've signed a whole new front line and then you've got Mo Salah there as well.",
      "\"So they're all competing, they all want to do well, they're all fighting against each other to get in the team and I think Wirtz is the one who's probably not doing as well. He's got so much ability and for me, I don't see where he gets in the team.",

However, Slot now has a headache in terms of team selection as a result, especially considering how Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah have thrived as of recent.",
      "Meanwhile, Slot was handed the first stumbling block of his season thus far on Saturday when Crystal Palace secured a 2-1 win at Selhurst Park. Ismaila Sarr opened the scoring for the Eagles early doors during the clash, before Federico Chiesa equalised on the 87th minute.",
      "And while late goals have saved the champions' skin on so many occasions this season already, it was Palace who snagged the winner deep into stoppage time, with Eddie Nketiah finding the back of the net in 90+7' to seal the deal.

      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher believes it's going to be tough for Ruben Amorim to turn things around at Manchester United following their latest defeat in the Premier League. The Red Devils were disappointing in the 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium this weekend.",
      "Keith Andrews' side raced to a 2-0 lead inside 20 minutes thanks to a brace from Igor Thiago, before Benjamin Sesko halved the deficit with his first goal for United since joining the club this summer. However, the flashpoint in the game saw Amorim's men awarded a penalty after Bryan Mbeumo was dragged to the floor by former teammate Nathan Collins.",
      "VAR took a look at the incident to adjudge whether or not the Brentford defender had denied the United forward a goalscoring opportunity after referee Craig Pawson brandished a yellow card for Collins. After a four-minute wait - including a double-substitution from the hosts, VAR deemed the foul not worthy of a red card with Bruno Fernandes stepping up to take the spot kick, but his effort was saved by Caoimhín Kelleher.",
      "Things would go from bad to worse with Mathias Jensen grabbing a third in injury time to pile further pressure on the Portuguese head coach. The result leaves United in 14th place with seven points from their opening six games amid reports that the club hierarchy has drafted up a three-man shortlist to replace Amorim.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager, but bringing in a manager like that in, in terms of the system that he played, I don't think really suited the traditions of Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker Manchester United make the decision on the manager, I think it's better for everybody because as I said, it's been a disaster for the club, but also the manager. We're only waiting for the inevitable.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as Duncan [Ferguson] said, you don't want to see people lose their jobs, but his has to end as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Duncan Ferguson said: \"You're talking Manchester United here, one of the biggest clubs in the world. Let's be fair, he's a lucky, lucky boy to still be in a job.",
      "\"I think he's got a bit of credit from what he did last year before coming to Man United. They were struggling and he didn't really want to come last season, so I think they've given him a bit of credit in the bank there.",
      "\"The stats are there for all to see. He's very lucky to stay in his job, but hopefully he gets a few more games to stay in his job as we always want a manager to be successful. But it's just not good enough.\"",
      "When asked if the group of players were better than they were currently performing, Ferguson added: \"I think they are but I think the system, he talks about that a lot but he's not tried to change the system or find a way.

To be fair, whenever they recruited him, they recruited him to play this formation and they knew what they were getting. They wanted that style of play and they've got that.\"",
      "Carragher agreed: \"100%, I think you're right and I'm big on that. I've never been one of those to say he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say 'the system might change but my style doesn't.'",
      "\"His baby is his system. It's like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Jurgen Klopp not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is and that's on [Omar] Berrada or Jason Wilcox, or Jim Ratcliffe, they brought him in.",
      "\"Talking about him changing centre-backs, a stat came out that in his 49 games, 42 times he's changed the back three. He did that at Sporting Lisbon. You knew that when he came in - the powers that be.",
      "\"The problem I think, when you look at Ruben Amorim, every other Premier League manager will look at Manchester United and think I can do a better job than that. The only positive for Manchester United, is they haven't gone all in on his system.",
      "\"They've gone all in, in terms of giving him money to spend but they haven't bought lots of centre-backs, they haven't bought lots of wing-backs. The players they bought in the summer can easily be flipped into a back four, getting Bruno Fernandes as the number ten, Bryan Mbeumo right wing, maybe [Matheus] Cunha to the left, Sesko up front.",
      "\"I think a competent football manager could get that Manchester United team in that system to the European places or certainly fighting for them. It couldn't have gone any worse.",
      "\"What he did at Sporting was really special, but it will be better for everyone to just shake hands and move on.\"",

      "Manchester United were at the centre of a viral joke on BBC Match of the Day following their defeat to Brentford with pressure on Ruben Amorim increasing as a result. Following a third Premier League loss of the season, United sit fourteenth after positive results for Leeds United and Brighton.",
      "Amorim's side kicked off the weekend's action at the Gtech Community Stadium and were two behind after just 20 minutes after an Igor Thiago brace. Benjamin Sesko halved the deficit before half-time, but United failed to find an equaliser with Bruno Fernandes missing a penalty before Mathias Jensen grabbed Brentford's third in stoppage time.",
      "As things stand, the United board are sticking behind Amorim with no replacement being lined-up. \"I am never concerned about my job - I am not that kind of guy,\" he told BBC Match of the Day on Saturday. \"It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.\"",
      "This weekend's clash against newly-promoted Sunderland at Old Trafford has seemingly become must-win for United. With games against Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come between the international breaks in October and November, it is unclear where United's next victory may arrive.",
      "Taking those games and two domestic pauses over the coming weeks into account, sacking Amorim could make sense with numerous verdicts delivered on his future at the club.",
      "Former Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart was the latest to offer his thoughts on Match of the Day. Prior to that, he was asked by presenter Gabby Logan if things could get any worse for United which saw Hart reference a viral Mick McCarthy clip and reply by saying, \"it can.\"",
      "The two-word quip from Hart left fellow pundit Ellen White and Logan in stitches.",
      "\"I don't know, you know,\" he then admitted when asked how much longer Amorim may have. \"They have very much made their bed with him, and they're sticking with him. I think they do believe in him, internally, but externally it is tough at the moment. Those sorts of results at the weekend are making it very difficult.\"",
      "The performances are also a concern with the two victories that United have picked up this season coming against 10-men and Burnley deep into added time. Man United icon Gary Neville made his thoughts very clear on Amorim and the decision facing the United hierarchy.",
      "Speaking on NBC, he said: \"I'm really, really worried. I would never go on television as I know how difficult a manager's job can be and say a manager should be sacked, but I suspect the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround.\"",

      "Off the pitch, things don't look much brighter for United. Since Ratcliffe took the reins in February 2024, he has introduced significant cost-cutting measures, resulting in several rounds of redundancies affecting hundreds of employees. Additionally, United announced a substantial ticket price hike during the summer.",
      "Considering everything together, United icon Rooney has voiced his concerns about the path that United are currently taking, both on and off the field.",
      "\"There needs to be a clear message from the owners,\" Rooney told BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show. \"Whether that is the Glazers, [minority owner] Sir Jim Ratcliffe, there has to be a message of where this club is going. At the minute we are all sitting there waiting for it to crumble.",
      "\"The culture of that football club has gone. I see it on a daily basis. I see staff losing jobs, people walking out of jobs. I've got two kids [in the academy] at that football club and I really hope this doesn't affect what they're doing. What I'm seeing at that football club is not Manchester United.",

      "Alan Shearer has hit back at Roy Keane after the Manchester United icon accused him of foul play. Keane alleged that Shearer deployed \"sneaky elbows\" throughout his prolific Premier League career.",
      "When questioned about whether he would have wanted Shearer in his own team rather than facing him as an opponent, a furious Keane responded: \"No, I didn't admire people who were nasty. Why are you saying that? I wouldn't I don't like nasty people. He was nasty, sneaky elbows, back of the head.\"",
      "Attempting to calm tensions, Ian Wright interjected: \"No, I don't think he's nasty,\" before Neville stoked the flames further by saying: \"I think he was horrible Alan, as a player. He knew how to dig you.\"",
      "When Jill Scott questioned whether that quality makes an effective player, Keane maintained his stern expression as he replied: \"No. [Eric] Cantona, [Andy] Cole. All these strikers I played with weren't sneaky. They were good honest pros, turned up every week and they weren't sneaky.\"",
      "Shearer has since hit back at Keane's remarks with backing from long-time friend and colleague, Gary Lineker. Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker raised the subject by saying: \"I saw Roy Keane had a swipe again at you, Alan.",
      "\"Sneaky, sneaky, he said, nasty, sneaky elbows and all this. It's amazing what rival pods will do to get a bit of PR.\"",
      "Pointing out apparent double standards from Keane, given the midfielder was notorious for his crunching challenges and fiery approach on the field, former Newcastle frontman Shearer responded: \"Someone sent me that the other day, Micah [Richards] sent me and Wrighty, I mean really? Come on. I mean, sneaky and nasty, some of the tackles? Come on, really? Yeah, okay.\"",
      "Lineker then reinforced his position by adding: \"Pot, kettle, black and all that kind of stuff,\" before the pair moved on. Premier League legends Keane and Shearer shared an intense rivalry during the early 2000s whilst representing United and Newcastle respectively.",
      "Tensions boiled over notably during a clash between the sides at St. James' Park in September 2001. In the dying moments of the match, which finished 4-3 in Newcastle's favour, Keane hurled the ball at Shearer after moving to the touchline for a throw-in, prompting the striker to shove him back.",
      "Keane then lost his cool, taking a swing at Shearer and earning himself a straight red card from referee Steve Bennett. He was then restrained by his team-mates as he charged towards the Newcastle player.",
      "Reflecting on the incident, the now 54-year-old said: \"I lost my temper, we were losing 4-3, I think, in the last minute. If you're going to get sent off, the worst thing is, I pushed him. If you're going to get sent off you might as well punch him properly because you're going to get the same punishment. You might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. That's what I was thinking afterwards. It was just a push. It was ridiculous.\"",

It also stated that all of the 32 teams involved in this summer’s Club World Cup who were analysed in the report, did not have the minimum 28-day rest period recommended by FIFPRO.",
      "This comes on the back of FIFPRO finding that just 14 per cent of players in Europe’s big five leagues who featured in Euro 2024, had the same minimum rest period. And Nottingham Forest striker Wood has called on the game's authorities to start listening to players, before they take matters into their own hands.",
      "Wood, who has joined FIFPRO's Global Player Council, was asked if a strike could happen. He said: \"It's a potential thing I'm sure, but we don't ever want to get to that point. We want to be able to try and safeguard as early as possible, to prevent anything happening.",
      "\"As FIFPRO we want to work with FIFA and other governing bodies, to come to a better outcome and protect the players of the future, or the players of now.",

      "Nevertheless, numerous managers have been linked to the role, following the disappointing result at the Gtech Community Stadium. Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner and Fabian Hurzeler have all emerged as possible candidates on United's shortlist.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims Xavi would eagerly seize the chance to manage at Old Trafford. The reporter revealed that the Spanish tactician has been \"studying\" the Premier League and would \"immediately\" accept the position if approached.",
      "Romano also suggests that United's absence from European competition hasn't deterred Xavi's interest. The former midfielder remains unemployed after departing Barcelona, where he secured the La Liga championship.",

The Premier League's all-time top scorer had previously slammed the decision not to dismiss the Bees defender for his role in Saturday afternoon's penalty incident.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo appeared set for a clear sight of goal as he latched onto Matheus Cunha's delivery, but Collins dragged him down, leading to a spot-kick. Despite preventing a clear goalscoring chance, the Irishman only received a booking.",
      "He was let off the hook by Caoimhin Kelleher, who denied Bruno Fernandes from 12 yards. The Premier League Match Centre explained that the 24-year-old centre-back avoided dismissal because it was adjudged that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "However, the justification from the Stockley Park officials failed to convince the Newcastle United legend, who maintained it was an incorrect call. Shearer expects the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss, Howard Webb, to acknowledge the error.",
      "\"Well, I'm told that was the match centre, that put that out, that's what the VAR relayed to each other and put that out,\" he said on the Rest is Football podcast.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has launched a scathing attack on the club, claiming it has lost its soul under the leadership of Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils suffered another setback in their Premier League campaign, slipping further down the table after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.",
      "Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag as head coach in November 2024, has struggled to find consistent form, failing to secure back-to-back victories in the English top-flight. The Portuguese head coach, whose contract at Old Trafford runs until June 2027, has managed to gather just 34 points from 33 matches.",
      "Rooney, speaking on his podcast with the BBC, expressed his dwindling faith in Amorim's abilities. The former England captain said: \"I just don't know what's going on. I have tried my hand in management, and it didn't work out too well – so I get it.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is my age, he's still a young manager, and I'm sure he's got a massive future, but what is going on at Man United? This is not Man United.\"",
      "The 39-year-old also criticised the current squad. Rooney said: \"I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting. I don't see character. I don't see a desire to win. I don't see ability. I don't see match winners.",
      "\"Nothing gets me off my feet. I go into a game watching, expecting, 'Okay, here we go again,' expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point. This is not Man United.\"",
      "Rooney continued: \"All day I've been debating this... do I say this? Shall I say it? Because I know it's going to bring pressure, and it's going to go into media, and it's going to get picked up, and the manager's going to get asked questions about it, but I feel I need to.",
      "\"I was at the football club for 13 years, and what is going on is not right. And this is not all on the manager, by the way. I'm seeing players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt, and it hurts.",
      "\"When you've been at a football club for that long and you care for the club, this is not acceptable what is going on. Man United haven't won back-to-back games for I don't know how long.\"",
      "Taking aim at the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Rooney said: \"I think there needs to be a clear message. A clear message from the owners. Whether that's the Glazers, whether that's Radcliffe, whether that's– there has to be a message of where this club is going. Because at the minute, we're all sitting there waiting for it to crumble.\"",
      "Rooney called for action from the United board, adding: \"The soul has gone from the club. It needs a new engine, a new lease of life. It needs something to kickstart that football club. What is going on? This is not all on the manager, by the way. Players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt and it hurts.\"",
      "On his view as a parent, Rooney said: \"The culture of that football club has gone. I see it on a daily basis. I see staff losing jobs, people walking out of jobs.",
      "\"I've got two kids (in the academy) at that football club and I really hope this doesn't affect what they're doing. What I'm seeing at that football club is not Manchester United.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney says has seen nothing to suggest Ruben Amorim will be able to turn things around at Manchester United after admitting he has \"no faith\" in the former Sporting Lisbon chief following Saturday's defeat at Brentford.",
      "United were beaten 3-1 by the Bees, meaning Amorim is still yet to win successive Premier League games since he arrived at Old Trafford back in November. The Portuguese coach has managed just 34 points from the 33 league games he has overseen during that period and scrutiny is beginning to grow on the beleaguered United chief, whose refusal to deviate from his preferred 3-4-2-1 system has also raised eyebrows.",
      "Although Amorim's torrid record continues to be questioned, the top brass at United insist they have no plans to replace their manager. But Rooney says he has not seen anything over the past 11 months to convince him that a turnaround is imminent.",
      "“I just don’t know what’s going on,” the former England and Manchester United striker said on the latest edition of his new BBC podcast, The Wayne Rooney Show. “I have tried my hand in management and it didn’t work out too well, I get it. Ruben Amorim is my age, he is still a young manager and I’m sure he still has a massive future.",
      "“But what’s going on at Man United – this is not Man United. I honestly hope he can turn it around and he does. But if you’re saying to me: ‘Do you believe he will?’ then, after everything I’ve seen, honestly, I’ve got no faith in it.",
      "“I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence. There needs to be big changes in my opinion. Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back.”",
      "United spent in excess of £260million on new players in the summer, including £200m on three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who scored his first goal for the club in Saturday's chastening defeat at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "While Rooney does not believe Amorim is the right person to fix the problems at United, he went on to make it clear that there are issues far beyond the manager, saying the \"soul from the club has gone\" in a brutally honest exchange.",
      "“I don’t recognise the whole football club,” he added. “I don’t see players fighting, I don’t see character, I don’t see desire to win. I go to a game watching, expecting, here we go again – expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point.”",
      "He continued: “It’s not even just results on the pitch. It’s everything about the club that needs fixing – Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have walked into a real challenge. We’re seeing staff members getting sacked after 20, 30 years who are very important people to that football club.",

      "Just goal difference keeps Sunderland in fifth behind Tottenham Hotspur in fourth, and they sit just four points adrift of table-toppers Liverpool. United would typically be fancied to overcome the newly-promoted side, but Neville is concerned the Black Cats could cause an upset.",
      "Speaking on his podcast at St. James' Park after Arsenal's win over Newcastle, the United legend insisted 'very big questions' would be posed to the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe should Sunderland emerge triumphant. He also explained why he's 'worried' about the club's future.",
      "\"I think when it gets to this point, you've got to see what happens next Saturday against Sunderland,\" said Neville. \"You've got a game at home against Sunderland.",

      "\"Big questions. They brought a young manager in. He's played a completely different system. They've invested in a completely different system. They brought [Patrick] Dorgu in, and they brought other players.",
      "\"And if they were to be 14th, 15th, 16th in October, which was where I said at the start of the season, if Manchester United are where they were last season in October, it's not a one-off.",
      "\"It becomes what you are, and it becomes a pattern, and then managers come under huge pressure. We've seen what's happened with Graham Potter (at West Ham) in the last few days.\"",
      "Neville continued: \"So, look, that's why I'm worried. That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away, and it's going to build up in this next week or so. And I think that a victory is needed more than ever at Old Trafford on Saturday against Sunderland.\"",
      "Speaking about the Brentford result, the ex-England international said: \"I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry. I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.\"",

    "body": [
      "Ruben Amorim is no stranger to dealing with pressure since becoming Manchester United manager, but this time it feels different.",
      "Amorim has won just 18 of his 49 matches in charge of United since November. As he approaches a year in charge, his players still appear no better at playing his prescribed formation. The 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday wasn't a nadir - that honour would have to go to Grimsby - but it was still telling.",
      "United were completely outplayed by their opponents and their manager appeared powerless to turn the tide. Amorim's side are 14th in the Premier League, having won two of their six matches, and owners Ineos are beginning to get twitchy.",
      "Sorry, Crystal Palace fans. Look away now. Oliver Glasner is the best and hottest managerial property in the Premier League right now. If Manchester United were to make a change then he would be the perfect fit.",
      "Glasner is not a flash in the pan. Unlike Ruben Amorim, he has got a proper body of work and real experience behind him. The job he has done at Palace has been phenomenal. They are hard to beat - they have not lost in the Premier League for nearly six months - and won the first trophy in the club’s history under him. Now they are enjoying a European campaign. But he has also managed big clubs - Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt - and won the Europa League.",
      "I am absolutely convinced that he would be RB Leipzig manager now if he had not won the FA Cup and had such a brilliant end to the season with Palace. Steve Parish, the Palace chairman, did so well to keep Glasner amid strong interest. Glasner is also a manager on the up. That is so important. He has got energy, experience and improves players. He would be perfect. But getting him would not be easy…",
      "Manchester United need someone to bring some calm to all the chaos at Old Trafford. Someone with experience and a level head. Someone who makes teams better and gets results. David Moyes, anyone?",
      "Moyes might have tried but failed - spectacularly it has to be said - in his previous time as United manager. But since then he has become older, wiser and better equipped to deal with the all-consuming challenge of managing United.",
      "He won a trophy for West Ham and is currently doing a wonderful job back at Everton. They say you should never go back, but if I was Sir Jim Ratcliffe I would be looking at appointing Moyes. Because this time round, the Scot wouldn't be filling the boots of a certain Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Simone Inzaghi is the man to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. At Inter Milan, he took a financially-cautious, patched-up squad (ring any bells, United fans?) and spun them into gold: one Serie A title, two Coppa Italias, three Supercoppas, and two Champions League finals. That’s exactly the kind of alchemy Old Trafford has been crying out for.",
      "His three-at-the-back system slots perfectly into United’s recent tactical shift, removing the need for another expensive squad overhaul. More importantly, his robust, no-nonsense approach would jolt United’s underperforming dressing room, instilling discipline and accountability where it’s sorely needed.",
      "Unlike tactically rigid managers - whose predictability increasingly feels outdated - Inzaghi thrives on flexibility. He adapts formations and rotates players based on context, ensuring he thrives in the modern game’s dynamic demands. His ability to balance spark with defensive grit would also address United’s fragility while unlocking their offensive potential.",
      "Inzaghi’s success, forged at two clubs (Inter and Lazio) burdened by big expectations but haunted by inconsistency, proves he’s ready to revive a sleeping giant like United. He may have just joined Al-Hilal, but if the hook is baited well enough, he'll bite.",
      "Ruben Amorim seems to be keeping his job on the strength of the Manchester United managers before him losing theirs. The cold, hard fact is he has been the worst of the lot since Fergie. They should be turning elsewhere and should be looking at current Premier League managers who have been successful in England. I think Spurs were really shrewd in appointing Thomas Frank and believe he would have been perfect for United.",
      "Now he's off the table, I'd be looking at Andoni Iraola. The job he's done at Bournemouth has been nothing short of remarkable. Yes, he's had a bit of money to spend. But the Cherries are by far and away the Premier League's smallest club, you only have to take one look at their stadium, and they continue to punch well above their weight.",
      "Not only that, they are doing it by playing attractive football and taking the game to their opponents, whoever they may be. They came close to securing European football last season and have made an impressive start so far this term, already sitting sixth.",
      "The Old Trafford hotseat is becoming something of a poisoned chalice, and it says it all when Iraola might actually think whether taking the United job right now is worth it. But he'd be my choice if I was Sir Jim.",
      "If Manchester United are to part ways with Ruben Amorim, and they may well decide it’s time to pull the trigger, they’ll need someone capable of hitting the ground running. They’ll also need someone capable of playing with a three centre-back system, and someone who can deal with an atmosphere which often looks to be just a minute away from turning poisonous.",
      "Step forward Gareth Southgate. One of his biggest cheerleaders, Dan Ashworth, might have left Old Trafford, but the argument for his appointment remains. The question is whether the former England boss wants this to be his first foray back into management. It feels like a poisoned chalice, but - on the plus side - any club job taken by Southgate would come with plenty of attention. The England job felt like just as much of a hiding to nothing when Southgate took the reins, and he did okay then. Surely it’s worth a try.",
      "The perfect Ruben Amorim replacement? Ruben Amorim. Without going full Unai Emery and repeating his name like Marco Bizot, there's no other solution for Manchester United right now than sticking with him. If Ineos truly want to breed a new era at Old Trafford, they have to break the groundhog day cycle. And they're in too deep with Amorim regardless having recruited for his unique system.",
      "How did it work out having Ralf Rangnick in interim charge for months on end? That's the situation United will be in if they axe him because doing so at this point in a season might work well for a relegation-threatened side who can call in a firefighter, but it very rarely works when you want to be competing at the other end of the table. I'm firmly in the 'give managers time' camp and so should Jim Ratcliffe be.",
      "Even after the poor start to the season that United are experiencing, I would still be surprised to see Amorim leave. It seems that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is determined to stick by his man no matter what. Were he to leave though, I feel that a move for Oliver Glasner would be exactly the sort of hire they should go for. In my mind, Glasner comes with the same kind of reputation that Thomas Frank had heading into Tottenham.",
      "He has overachieved at Crystal Palace and would be the kind of manager to install confidence into these players. My only fear would be whether or not the job would begin to wear him down. However, you look at the calibre of player that Glasner has managed and nurtured since arriving at Selhurst Park, you have to feel that his appointment would be both realistic and a step in the right direction.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chief Manchester United Football Correspondent. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way as his predecessor.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system and refusal to move away from it, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings would make the team stronger from the get-go.",
      "United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casmerio's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for him to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim held a team bonding day for players and their families – despite his increasingly precarious position.",
      "Amorim's future was plunged further into doubt following Saturday's dismal 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which means the Portuguese head coach has still to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "The open day for players and their families, attended by Amorim and his family and held at United's Carrington training ground on Sunday, is understood to have been arranged before the start of the season to allow the squad's wives, partners and children to see first-hand the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex.",
      "United's players took part in a training session, watched by their families, then food for everyone was served in the revamped canteen for the first-team squad, with activities for children laid on to keep them entertained.",
      "The fact the open day still went ahead, despite the crushing loss at Brentford, shows that, for Amorim at least, it remains business as usual, despite the pressure mounting on the United boss, who has won just nine of his 33 league games in charge, losing 17 of them.",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney has described the club as “broken” and said there are some players there who are “not deserving to wear the shirt”. Amorim has also come under fire from other United legends, including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, but continues to have the backing of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "How long that remains the case, only time will tell. United's players were given Monday off and are back in training on Tuesday, to begin preparations for Saturday's visit of Sunderland – currently riding high in fifth place - which has become a must-win game for Amorim before the two-week international break.",
      "When United return to action, they have a daunting trip to champions, arch rivals and league leaders Liverpool. Whether Amorim is still in charge for that Anfield visit, only the United hierarchy know, but Saturday's result will undoubtedly go a long way to deciding the fate of the club's sixth permanent manager in the 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down.",
      "If United can beat Sunderland, Amorim will likely live to fight another day. Lose, and the hierarchy's proclaimed faith in him will be pushed to the limit, under pressure from fans to make a change, many of who have already had enough of a manager who has so far flattered to deceive.",

      "Ruben Amorim is under growing pressure at Manchester United after a bad start to the season.",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the weekend, which means Amorim is still yet to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Amorim is understood to retain the backing of the board, despite suffering a further setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, and United have insisted no replacement is being lined up.",
      "That hasn't stopped Amorim's future from dominating headlines. United were forced to clarify that Amorim would not be axed after defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last month, and supporters are becoming increasingly impatient with United's failure to string together a run of positive results.",
      "They were all asked to react to the start of the campaign and give their honest thoughts.",
      "Tot Barling, a lifelong United fan and European away regular, said: \"I mean, inevitably you've got to be disappointed [with the start to the season]. I know it took Fergie five years and Klopp five years, but that doesn't happen these days. You have to give time to build, but in the modern game, he's been there long enough. With the summer signings, one was hoping for a good start.",
      "\"It looked ok against Arsenal, albeit the result wasn't good. I was talking to friends after Saturday and I was disappointed with the whole feeling. The players don't look like they're up for it.",
      "\"Amorim has lost his spark, that joyous spark that he had when he first came, and so there's not a lot at the moment to grab hold of in terms of when is it going to get better? How will it get better?",
      "\"I'm disappointed and worried to summarise. For a man who seems to be so tactically aware, he is intransigent. It's clearly not working for whatever reason. Maybe the Premier League does not suit his formation compared to Portugal's top-flight.",
      "\"I can't believe now with the turnover of players that it's because they are not all up to understanding what he wants. Maybe it just doesn't work. I'm not sure that giving him more time will help.",
      "\"I don't know whether getting rid of him is going to help either because I'm not sure what the deep-seated problem is at the club. We've gone through so many managers who haven't been able to turn it around. Although I have one controversial view that if we hadn't brought Ole back, I think he would have done a good job. But that scuppered him.",
      "\"Apart from that, it always ends up in these dressing room conflicts, reports of the manager losing the dressing room, and that's how it appears to be at the moment, because the players don't seem to be responding to what he wants.\"",
      "Barling continued: \"He's an intelligent man, he's principled and knows what he wants, but I was just looking it up. The phrase 'madness is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result' is what he seems to be doing at the moment.",
      "\"You would have thought common sense... The opposition is different each week, so you surely have to change your system, and given that the players at the moment aren't responding, that's another reason to tweak it. His refusal to do that either before or during a game is baffling for somebody with a good understanding of the game. That is what is confusing me.",
      "\"I don't know whether he is actually just not that good at understanding the game, or whether he only knows this way of doing it and he's got nothing else to try. But my view would be, he must know the writing is on the wall with the way things are going, so why not mix it up a bit?",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is being played out of position, in a role he cannot fulfil. Why didn't he take the wrath of the fans, take the £100m and sell Bruno, and say well, he wasn't going to get in the No.10 role because I have Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There are too many inconsistencies. And likewise, I'm not saying he's better or worse, but why sell [Rasmus] Hojlund and bring in [Benjamin] Sesko. They are very similar players, Sesko is untried in the Premier League. Everybody agreed Hojlund wasn't working because he wasn't getting service from the wings or midfield.",
      "\"You go and replace with him with a guy who has scored a few goals in the German league, but who relies on service from the wings and midfield. And you're not giving him that service. All they've done is spend money on a young and unproven striker in the same mould.\"",
      "Matt Pickett, who has a season ticket in the Stretford End, said: \"It's the same s***. We're just getting worse. I was at the Arsenal game and I saw a completely different team. The chances we were creating, the way we were playing. We were unlucky with an individual error costing a goal, and then we should have had a penalty. Even though we lost, I was quite happy.",
      "\"However, if he can't adapt to different systems now, I wouldn't be sad if he were gone tomorrow. I liked him for getting rid of some of the deadwood, wanting to bring back standards and not pandering to some of the bigger names.",
      "\"But the stats don't lie now. At any other serious club he would be gone, regardless of what he's good at saying or doing in a press conference. I don't want him to go because I would like him to stay, but if he did go, then it wouldn't be an issue for me. If anything, it would be more exciting.",
      "\"You can't go that long without winning back-to-back games in the Premier League. It's inexcusable now. Sunderland are above us in the league. The players we have, that shouldn't be the case.",
      "\"I know we had a tough start with the fixtures, but we should have beat Fulham, we shouldn't be getting beat by Brentford, we scraped it against Burnley and only beat Chelsea probably because they had 10 men for a large part of the game.",
      "\"And I was looking at it, the games Amorim has won have been against bad teams. He keeps changing the starting team. He's stubborn and it will cost him the job, but I don't think he cares any more.",
      "\"Fergie was always making little tweaks to his system and evolving. It's obvious to everyone, you're going to have to be able to change how we play. Certainly if it's short-term to depend on who we are playing.",
      "\"The wing backs don't really do anything, Dalot has been poor and Amorim is just digging in more. We're getting into Ten Hag territory now. And why did Yoro not start on Saturday? It's just concerning.",
      "\"As a match-going fan, I'm getting bored, and getting bored of the excuses, bored of getting beaten. It's hard in the work group when I can't even stick out. We have bought decent players.\"",
      "Pickett added: \"If you look at Madrid, Barca, even some of the lower league teams, if it's not working, they make a change. You don't get time now. If you're losing because we're playing so well and someone makes a mistake, you can forgive it, but not when we're getting overrun by Brentford.",
      "\"We don't look like we have the capacity to score against some teams. I was firmly behind Amorim with Garnacho. It was disappointing, but I was behind him. The way he managed that one was good. Even with Rashford. He did nothing for two years and couldn't be a****. When Amorim got rid of him, I thought fair play because you're making hard decisions and putting the club first.",
      "\"Even with the Mainoo thing when he wanted to leave on loan. Just because he wants to play at the World Cup, what if someone got injured and we needed him? He's 20, you play for United.",
      "\"I like his man management, and the decisions he makes like that are refreshing and almost Fergie-esque. But then his ability to actually look at a game and change the system isn't there. He's stubborn.\"",
      "Salford-based Will Cooper said: \"They're incredibly inconsistent, which is annoying. There are moments we do look good, and then there are times when we look like we've never played football before.",
      "\"I thought we could have won 4-0 against Burnley, but we made a meal of it. City game was a disgrace. It looked like the players didn't want to be there against Grimsby, but the system is irrelevant for that game because our players are so much better than their players. It shouldn't have even been a close game.",
      "\"I don't think he should be sacked, though. I can see what he's building towards, but I think the entire system is built around having two great midfielders. You can't play with two in midfield against a three-man midfield without having the players for it. We need someone who can win the ball back, who can carry it.",
      "\"I think he should be given more time. The team selection is sometimes a bit odd, but I still think he's trying to figure out his best team.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim received a comforting tap on the back from a Manchester United staff member in the bowels of the Gtech Community Stadium after finishing his press conference.",
      "Amorim spoke for six minutes and 12 seconds during his post-match address to the media. And it's starting to feel like United's head coach is on borrowed time in Manchester.",
      "Amorim praised United's aggression against Chelsea, but that was absent against Brentford, who did not look like the team that had suffered a bad defeat the previous weekend.",
      "The warning signs were there from the first whistle. Brentford found pockets of space to exploit and Amorim did not look pleased, pacing up and down the touchline with his water bottle.",
      "Nathan Collins should have received a red card for bringing Bryan Mbeumo to the ground, but Bruno Fernandes did not convert the penalty. That decision went against United, but they were not good enough.",
      "Amorim chugged water and dropped his bottle to the floor when Mathias Jensen scored Brentford's third goal. He looked like a manager on the brink, although United sources have insisted he retains the backing of the board and no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Speaking before Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's normal the fans don't know what is going to happen in the next game. To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager.\"",
      "Amorim was not joking when he said he doesn't know which version will turn up, but that is the reason many fans are starting to believe he is not the manager to take United forward.",
      "It's worrying that Amorim still needs to micromanage his players during matches, despite being in charge for 11 months. His behaviour on the touchline hasn't changed from his first game against Ipswich Town.",
      "Every football manager gives instructions from the touchline during matches, but the extent to which Amorim must gesture for players to get into the areas he wants is a red flag.",
      "There have been concerns with the system from the moment Amorim was appointed. Some loyal season ticket holders questioned why a coach who plays a formation that does not align with United's traditional philosophy had been appointed, while others suggested it was time for meaningful change.",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has joked that even the Pope could not make him change his approach. That stubbornness may prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlook for the weeks ahead looked significantly better after a spirited Chelsea victory, but Amorim was unable to win back-to-back league games for the first time. United continue to take one step forward and two steps back, which has made progress impossible.",
      "The underlying data suggest United have improved this season, but a spreadsheet will not save Amorim from the chopping block - securing wins and moving up the league table will.",
      "The three games sandwiched between the September and October international breaks felt huge for Amorim, although it's illogical to decide his future on a game-by-game basis.",
      "What would change if United win against Sunderland before the October break? It feels like a victory would only delay the inevitable, but it's not a surprise that Ineos are dithering.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment. It reflects badly on United's chiefs if they decide to sack Amorim.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window and Amorim has no excuses not to make it work. However, a roaring success story is now required for him to turn it around.",
      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Amorim on the final day of last season, and a banner with those words has recently been unfurled in the Stretford End to show support for him.",
      "It will be interesting to see whether that banner is raised against Sunderland this weekend.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings, would make the team stronger from the get-go. United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for Amorim to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it, in the face of such overwhelming evidence.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, September 30.",
      "Ruben Amorim finds himself under renewed scrutiny at Old Trafford following United's 3-1 loss to Brentford. Reports indicate that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United's minority shareholder, continues to back the Portuguese manager.",
      "This follows claims that United have compiled a three-man shortlist to replace the head coach, with former England manager Gareth Southgate among the names. Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola, credited with impressive work at Crystal Palace and Bournemouth respectively, are also reported to be on the shortlist.",
      "Former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has also been tentatively linked, while sensational reports have suggested Sean Dyche and recently-sacked Graham Potter as possible successors to the Portuguese coach.",
      "Reports also suggest that former Barcelona manager Xavi is interested in making the switch to the Premier League and returning to management in the Old Trafford hotseat.",
      "In transfer news, United have once again been linked with a move for Nigerian star Victor Osimhen.",
      "The forward currently plies his trade in the Turkish Super League after leaving Napoli. He has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, including last summer but it didn't materialise.",
      "Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane remains in the headlines and spoke recently about a possible return to the Premier League.",
      "Meanwhile, there is talk that Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is on the radar for United too.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner could have been managing a different Premier League side this season as the Austrian is linked with Man United.",
      "Bookmakers have named Glasner as the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim, amid growing speculation about Amorim’s future at United following their 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend. The Portuguese head coach is believed to still have the backing of the board despite the latest setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, with United maintaining that no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Club sources said similar following the humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and supporters have grown increasingly frustrated with the team's inability to put together a consistent run of positive results. The 2-1 win over Chelsea lifted spirits at Old Trafford, but the performance against Brentford was a setback.",
      "A number of managers have been rumoured as potential replacements, and Glasner, who has won the FA Cup and Community Shield, could have replaced Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham earlier this summer.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Under-pressure Man United boss Ruben Amorim held a team bonding day for players and their families – despite his increasingly precarious position.",
      "Amorim's future was plunged further into doubt following Saturday's dismal 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which means the Portuguese head coach has still to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "Reds legend Wayne Rooney has described the club as “broken” and said there are some players there who are “not deserving to wear the shirt”. Amorim has also come under fire from other United legends, including Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, but continues to have the backing of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",

As a result, Zirkzee has reportedly emerged as a potential target for the January transfer window.",
      "FourFourTwo understands that there was interest from Italian giants in bringing him back during the 2025 transfer window.",
      "Man United reportedly remain keen on Bournemouth star Semenyo, having apparently held talks in the summer.",
      "In addition to united, it's said that Tottenham, Manchester Cirty and Aston Villa have shown interest in him and have scouted him this season.",
      "But other clubs in Europe are also thought to be monitoring the 25-year-old. Speaking to TBR Football, correspondent Graeme Bailey said: \"He had Man United and Tottenham showing interest in the summer and now some of Europe’s top clubs are looking.",
      "\"As it stands, Bournemouth are intent on making progress this summer and that means no sales. They have lost the likes of Huijsen, Kerkez and Zabarnyi in recent months and they are insistent Semenyo won’t be following them through the exit doors in January.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand told his Rio Presents podcast: \"If they played 4-2-3-1, I think you've got all the players playing in positions that they're super comfortable in. You've got two central midfielders out of three probably in Casemiro, [Manuel] Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo to play in there.",
      "\"And then you've got three across the front, anyone from Amad [Diallo], [Bryan] Mbeumo, [Matheus] Cunha, Mason Mount - even Mainoo. All of them and Bruno [Fernandes] can all play in them positions anywhere across that front line.",

      "The Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday afternoon, with Igor Thiago scoring twice and Mathias Jensen adding a late goal to seal all three points for the home side.

      "After impressing since the turn of the September international break, Barcelona are keen to sign the England international but for a reduced fee in the region of £26m. And Borson believes that it's a problem for United because the Reds don't have control of the situation.",
      "He told Football Insider: \"The player is going to end up boxingManchester United in. I think it's clear that United obviously want to sell the player. I mean, you just loaned him out. Where are we going to get to next summer?",
      "\"Whatever he does, whether he plays well or whether he's mediocre, whether he's patchy, you get to next summer and there's one bidder on the table and the player says he only wants to go to Barcelona. Well, in that scenario, they may well get him for £25m.\"",

      "The Catalan outlet writes: \"No other player in the major leagues has done more than him in a season that was presented as a test for the Manchester United loanee. A test he is passing with flying colours so far, with fundamental contributions such as long-range shots.\"",
      "\"I think that's the sad state of affairs where the find themselves. It's worrying and it's something we'll get into a bit more detail tonight. The system doesn't suit the players and I totally understand that.",
      "\"The powers that be employed the manager knew what system he played, that's what gave him success. If you've had success as a manager, that's always going to be what you fall back to or fall back on when things aren't going well.",
      "\"I can understand that he sticks with his system because that's his baby, that's his thing. That's what he does. The people in charge of Manchester United picked a manager who doesn't sort of stand by or signify - certainly going forward - the traditions of that club going back 60 or 70 years.",

      "Bookmakers have named Glasner as the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim, amid growing speculation about Amorim’s future at United following their 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend. The Portuguese head coach is believed to still have the backing of the board despite the latest setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, with United maintaining that no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Club sources said similar following the humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and supporters have grown increasingly frustrated with the team's inability to put together a consistent run of positive results. The 2-1 win over Chelsea lifted spirits at Old Trafford, but the performance against Brentford was a setback.",
      "A number of managers have been rumoured as potential replacements, and Glasner, who has won the FA Cup and Community Shield, could have replaced Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham earlier this summer.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, former Palace chairman Simon Jordan revealed that he suggested Glasner to ex-Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy during the summer. Spurs were searching for a new manager to replace Postecoglou, but Levy ultimately chose to appoint Thomas Frank from Brentford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I like Glasner. With all due respect to the departed, I actually said to Daniel (Levy) about him during the summer, ‘Why not Glasner?’,\" Jordan disclosed. \"He had his own views on it, but I think he's a top, top manager.",
      "\"Do I think he'll be Palace manager at the end of the season? I'll be amazed because he's got nothing left on his contract now. This is his last year. He hasn't been given the support yet. He's working the oracle. They're taking their best players out, repeatedly taking their best players out.",
      "\"Fortunately for Palace, which is the great thing they're not taking them out, these clubs are having to pay for them now. That's the good thing about it. [Eberechi] Eze's gone and for top money, Olise went for decent money and people are having to pay for it. And Guehi, he didn't walk out the door. But again, they're operating at their highest level.",
      "\"It's like Nottingham Forest last year. Their run of form, as a unit, as a team is fabulous. Look at the teams that they're beating, look at the results that they're getting and they've got a European competition. So, we'll see how that plays out with the strength of their squad.\"",

      "The last time an Austrian took charge at Manchester United things went downhill. And fast.",
      "That was back in 2021 when Ralf Rangnick became caretaker boss at Old Trafford, given the job on an interim basis following the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure. Rangnick went on to become known as 'Wreck-it Ralf' - and left at the end of his first season.",
      "But fast forward to now and elsewhere in the Premier League, another Austrian is doing the exact opposite to what Rangnick did. He's repairing the reputation of his nation when it comes to success, winning trophies, leading his side to new heights and enhancing his own reputation beyond what anyone had ever imagined. Take a bow, Oliver Glasner.",
      "In fact, the only thing Glasner has got wrong since taking charge of Crystal Palace is to defend Rangnick in an interview, insisting people have got it all wrong when it comes to his close friend. We can forgive him for this, because the ex-Eintracht Frankfurt manager's work at Selhurst Park has been nothing short of remarkable.",
      "When Glasner replaced Roy Hodgson in south London in 2024, he walked into a club that had never landed a major trophy. He made dreams come true with their FA Cup success, beating Manchester City in the final.",
      "Then they outlasted Liverpool in the Community Shield. Arne Slot's side, the best team in the land and reigning English champions, again fell to the Eagles at the weekend. It left Slot, of all people, complaining about too much stoppage time at the end - talk about a lack of self-awareness.",
      "But more importantly, it left Glasner's men boasting an 18-match unbeaten record. That equals a club record dating back to 1969. The high-flying Eagles now sit third in the table and if they can continue on this path, they're Champions League contenders.",
      "This season, on the back of that FA Cup triumph, they're in Europe for the first time. Had it not been for some baffling bureaucracy, Palace would be competing in the Europa League instead of the Conference League.",
      "Now what would United give for European football? The lofty heights of a place in the top four?",
      "Heck, what would they give for back-to-back wins right now? That's still something Ruben Amorim hasn't been able to manage.",
      "Even Palace's decision to sell big names for big fees, including Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, has had no impact on Glasner's progress.",
      "Chairman Steve Parish deserves huge credit for appointing Glasner. He did his homework and targeted someone with a genuine talent for rejuvenating struggling sides. The biggest decision a chairman ever has to make is deciding who the manager should be. And no doubt, Parish appears to have hit the jackpot.",
      "United boss Amorim earns almost double what his Austrian counterpart banks - and while the Portuguese can't get his 3-4-3 formation to work at Old Trafford, Glasner's 3-4-3 has turned Palace into a nightmare opponent for the Premier League elite.",
      "But in the fanciful and fickle world of football, there's no question that United should be looking to replace Amorim - and Glasner ticks a hell of a lot of boxes.",
      "Parish would do well to secure Glasner's future. But doing so won't be easy, when Glasner knows he's on bigger clubs' radars and has seen the likes of Thomas Frank make big moves - doubling his salary.",
      "However much it costs Parish to keep Glasner it will be money well spent, because he's worth his weight in gold. But if United are looking into a post-Amorim era, then hiring the club's second Austrian boss may be the smart move.",

      "As the Portuguese boss continues to struggle, Glasner, who currently has Crystal Palace in second position in the Premier League, has been linked as a potential replacement, should United decide to part with Amorim. It was recently claimed the Austrian manager would relish the opportunity to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "TalkSPORT claim that Glasner would accept the opportunity to manage United \"in a heartbeat\", having also recently stated the Austrian was on a three-man shortlist also featuring ex-England manager Gareth Southgate and Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola.",
      "Amorim remained defiant in the face of questions about his job potentially being in peril if performances do not improve. He said: \"I'm always comfortable with the job.",
      "\"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "One of the biggest criticisms levelled against the ex-Sporting manager is his stubborn refusal to shift from his 3-4-3 formation, despite mounting evidence the current crop of players are not suited to it. This thought was recently put forward by Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former central defender urged Amorim to move to a more functional 4-2-3-1 system, which was regularly played by Erik ten Hag and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He told Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"If they played 4-2-3-1, I think you’d have all the players in positions they are comfortable in.",
      "\"You’d have two of the three midfielders – probably Casemiro, (Manuel) Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo – playing in there. Then you’ve got three across the front: Amad (Diallo), (Matheus) Cunha, (Bryan) Mbeumo, even Mainoo or Bruno (Fernandes).",
      "\"All of them can play anywhere across the front line, with (Benjamin) Sesko up top and you’ve got Bruno in the number 10 role, where he has produced astronomical numbers since joining the club. I don’t think it’s rocket science – everyone can see the same.”",
      "Fernandes missed another crucial penalty kick in the loss to Brentford. The United skipper, who also blasted a spot-kick over the crossbar in the 1-1 away draw with Fulham, tried to send the keeper the wrong way, only for his tame effort to be easily saved.",
      "Summer signing Sesko did manage to score his first goal for the club, but there was little time for him to celebrate as the Red Devils were already trailing by two goals from Brentford forward Igor Thiago.",
      "As United pushed for an equaliser, Mathias Jensen scored a vital third for Keith Andrews side, who moved ahead of United in the table.",

      "Two goals from Igor Thiago in the first half at Gtech Community Stadium saw that hope diminish significantly with Mathias Jensen grabbing the Bees' third in the final knockings. Benjamin Sesko grabbed his first United goal earlier in the game but it did not impact the overall outcome with Bruno Fernandes also missing a penalty.",

      "Alan Shearer has called out Roy Keane's double standards after the Manchester United legend recently accused him of dirty tactics during his playing days.",
      "Speaking on a recent instalment of The Overlap, Keane claimed that Shearer utilised \"sneaky elbows\" during his goal-laden Premier League tenure with the likes of Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United, while Gary Neville was compelled to agree with his stance.",
      "Keane said: \"Shearer was sneaky. Sneaky elbows,\" before Neville added: \"I thought Alan was just, to be fair, nasty I'll be honest with you. He was nasty, Alan, he was horrible.\"",
      "When probed on whether he would have supported Shearer in his own team rather than playing against him, an incensed Keane replied: \"No, I didn't admire people who were nasty. Why are you saying that?I wouldn't I don't like nasty people. He was nasty, sneaky elbows, back of the head.\"",
      "In a bid to diffuse the situation, Ian Wright said: \"No, I don't think he's nasty,\" before Neville added fuel to the fire with: \"I think he was horrible Alan, as a player. He knew how to dig you.\"",
      "When asked by Jill Scott if that makes a good player, Keane remained straight-faced as he said: \"No. [Eric] Cantona, [Andy] Cole. All these strikers I played with weren't sneaky. They were good honest pros, turned up every week and they weren't sneaky.\"",
      "Shearer has since defended himself against Keane's comments with a little help from long-time friend and colleague, Gary Lineker. Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker brought up the topic by saying: \"I saw Roy Keane had a swipe again at you, Alan.",
      "\"Sneaky, sneaky, he said, nasty, sneaky elbows and all this. It's amazing what rival pods will do to get a bit of PR.\"",
      "Highlighting perceived double standards from Keane, considering the midfielder was known for his meaty tackles and aggressive nature on the pitch, former Newcastle striker Shearer replied: \"Someone sent me that the other day, Micah [Richards] sent me and Wrighty, I mean really? Come on. I mean, sneaky and nasty, some of the tackles? Come on, really? Yeah, okay.\"",
      "Lineker then underlined his stance by adding: \"Pot, kettle, black and all that kind of stuff,\" before the duo moved on. Premier League icons Keane and Shearer endured a fierce rivalry against one another in the early 2000s while playing for United and Newcastle respectively.",
      "Tensions bubbled over particularly during a clash between the two teams at St James' Park in September 2001. In the final minutes of the match, which ended 4-3 in Newcastle's favour, Keane threw the ball at Shearer after heading to the touchline to take a throw in, before the striker pushed him in response.",
      "Keane then lost his temper with Shearer, taking a swing at him, receiving a straight red card from referee Steve Bennett as a result, before he was held back by team-mates as he furiously rushed towards the Newcastle man. Speaking previously about the incident, the now 54-year-old said: \"I lost my temper, we were losing 4-3, I think, in the last minute.",
      "\"If you're going to get sent off, the worst thing is, I pushed him. If you're going to get sent off you might as well punch him properly because you're going to get the same punishment. You might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. That's what I was thinking afterwards. It was just a push. It was ridiculous.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United lost yet again in the Premier League as they were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday.",
      "United found themselves 2-0 down inside 20 minutes, with Igor Thiago scoring twice for Brentford. Benjamin Sesko scored his first United goal to give the Reds hope of a comeback.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had the chance to make it 2-2 from the spot in the second half after Bryan Mbeumo was brought down in the area but his penalty was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher. Mathias Jensen scored late on to make it 3-1.",
      "Stick with us for reaction from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "It turns out Ruben Amorim was right to say he had no idea which version of his Manchester United side would show up.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, the version that turned out at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium was the one that continues to frustrate and infuriate him and United's fans.",
      "Every time this United team seems to have turned a corner, as they did with their hard-earned win over Chelsea the previous weekend, in which they showed hitherto unseen character and aggression, they somehow manage to regress and revert to type.",
      "Here, the seeds of their latest setback were sewn inside the first 20 minutes, Brentford striker Igor Thiago profiting from the uncertainty in United's defence to plunder two goals, the United boss left shaking his head at his team's continued failings.",
      "Where this leaves Amorim, only the United hierarchy know. There is an unwillingness to countenance the prospect that his position as head coach is under threat, after the United chief executive went all out to hire him and in so doing put his own reputation on the line.",
      "But those in charge at United cannot hide from the glaring truth that the team is simply not showing enough signs of progress under Amorim. Seven points from a possible 18 is simply not acceptable, after he was backed in the summer with £236million worth of new signings to strengthen his squad.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "No chance with the opener but kept United in it with two fine first-half saves in succession. Did well to make the initial save moments before conceding the second. Beaten from range late on. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Sloppy header moments after the restart nearly allowed Brentford through on goal, but made a vital tackle to clear the danger. 5",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Culpable for Brentford's opener, allowing Thiago to get away from him and failing to track his run from an onside position. Solid aerially thereafter. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Found himself exposed on several occasions when Patrick Dorgu pushed forward, allowing Brentford to exploit the space left down the left side he was tasked with defending. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Back in the starting line-up after missing United's previous two games through injury, he looked rusty, with Brentford's second goal coming down his side. Sloppy. 5",
      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle here at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Brentford counter-attack and make it 3-1 through Jensen.",
      "Eight minutes added here.",
      "Dorgu has been replaced by Zirkzee.",
      "Mount has replaced Shaw for the final 10 minutes.",
      "Fernandes' penalty is saved - that was a huge moment.",
      "Mbeumo is brought down and United have a penalty.",

      "He's already been an improvement in the midfield",
      "Mainoo and Yoro ON.",
      "Ugarte and Maguire OFF.",
      "The 1,721 United fans who have made the trip to Brentford are getting frustrated by what they’re seeing and have made clear their feelings with a sustained chant of “Attack! Attack! Attack!”",
      "They have every right to demand more from their team, who have been meek and insipid going forward, failing to cause Brentford any problems, aside from Sesko’s first-half goal. There is no sense of United getting in behind Brentford’s defence and threatening their goal, and as it stands, the visitors are toothless in attack. Changes need to be made, with Mount and Zirkzee surely set to come on soon.",
      "Lovely ball in the box from Mbeumo, but Sesko can't connect and Dorgu failed to meet it at the back post.",
      "United have been poor on the ball today, which is why Amorim looks so stressed on the touchline.",
      "Dorgu just lost possession and Mbeumo waved his arms in frustration at the other side of the pitch.",
      "Here we go for the second half of the game in London.",
      "Here are your half-time ratings:",
      "Bayindir - exposed 6",

      "Maguire - hesitant 4",
      "Shaw - sloppy 4",
      "Dalot - erratic 5",
      "Ugarte - busy 6",
      "Fernandes - quiet 5",
      "Dorgu - determined 6",
      "Mbeumo - peripheral 5",
      "Sesko - clinical 6",
      "Cunha - industrious 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Brentford are leading at the Gtech.",
      "Dorgu just told Bayindir to calm down and take his time on the ball.",
      "Brentford fans just heckled Shaw for sending a long ball into the stands instead of finding Fernandes.",
      "Although United have not made the start they wanted, it's an entertaining game. The early-kick off slot can often produce slow contests, but there's a good pace to it and there has been chances at both ends.",
      "Sesko hardly celebrated and Amorim gestured his players to rush back for the restart - game on.",
      "Sesko has his first goal for United, although VAR are checking the goal for a foul in the build-up.",
      "United are undone once again, conceding a sloppy second, with the home fans singing “Bryan, what’s the score?” to their former forward Mbeumo, who left them for United in the summer. Amorim’s defence found themselves on the back foot again, Bayindir palming away Schade’s cross and very nearly kept out the rebound, which was turned in by Thiago, for his second of the game. It’s a long way back for the Reds from here.",
      "This could be a repeat of the embarrassing defeat 4-0 in August 2022. Brentford lost to Fulham last weekend, and this was a huge chance to build momentum after Chelsea. United have made a shocking start and have given themselves a mountain to climb in London.",
      "Thiago scores again for Brentford, who have been the dominant side in the opening exchanges.",
      "Bayindir made a save, but Thiago was there to tap in the rebound to make it 2-0.",
      "Cunha is becoming unhappy with Sesko, who picked the wrong pass just there.",
      "He had another word with him when the ball went out of play.",
      "Cunha comes close to producing an immediate response, just shooting wide of the post. United need to get him on the ball because he is bound to make something happen.",
      "Amorim is clearly not happy with how deep his United team are sitting, shaking his head and imploring them to push up.",
      "Moments later, United are caught cold, a long ball from Jordan Henderson met by Igor Thiago, who lets it bounce before thrashing it past Bayindir. United’s defence were convinced Thiago was offside, but after a VAR check, the goal stands and Brentford lead 1-0.",
      "That's a horrible goal to concede. It was far too simple to launch that ball forward to Thiago. Maguire was left isolated. Amorim did not look pleased before the goal, and certainly won't be happy now."

Ruben Amorim's side failed to make it back-to-back wins, giving themselves a mountain to climb in the capital as Bruno Fernandes missed a second-half penalty.",
      "It was the manner in which the Bees conceded the spot-kick which has sparked uproar. Matheus Cunha played it across to Bryan Mbeumo, with a clear sight of goal, before he was hauled down in the penalty area by Collins.",
      "The penalty was given and the Republic of Ireland international was shown a yellow card for the action of pulling the Cameroon forward but following an explanation from the Premier League Match Centre X account, a community note has emerged on the tweet.",

      "Premium users of the platform are able to add community notes where they can prove that the initial point is incorrect.",
      "Citing the International Football Association Board (IFAB) laws of the game, a rebuttal was put forward which read: \"Control of the ball is not required for a red card.",
      "\"For DOGSO (denial of a goalscoring opportunity), referees consider distance to goal, direction of play, likelihood of keeping/gaining the ball, and defenders' positions. It's about likelihood, not current control.\"",
      "In the IFAB laws, it states: \"Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.\"",
      "In the context of the game, Collins remained on the field when the red card would have given United a lift.",
      "While there is no guarantee that Fernandes would have dispatched the penalty anyway, it could well have aided their response to the 2-1 scoreline - which eventually became three when Mathias Jensen rounded off proceedings in the fifth minute of stoppage time.",

      "Ruben Amorim is coming under increased pressure after Manchester United lost again in the Premier League.",
      "Having beaten Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend, Amorim had the chance to earn back-to-back league wins for the first time since he joined United nearly a year ago.",
      "But once again, he failed, overseeing a poor 3-1 defeat away to Brentford. United were battered in the opening stages before a goal from Benjamin Sesko, his first for the club, gave them hope of a comeback.",
      "But when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty after a bizzare decision not to show Brentford's Nathan Collins a red card, it became clear that it wouldn't be United's day. The Bees added a third in stoppage time, condemning Amorim to his 17th league defeat in just 33 games.",
      "Now speculation over his position is intensifying, as MEN Sport takes a look at a new development.",
      "Gareth Southgate is reportedly on Manchester United's three-man shortlist to potentially replace Amorim - and he's already been in direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. That's according to talkSPORT, who report that United are likely to wait until November to pull the trigger.",
      "This would be to reduce the level of compensation, as Amorim will've been in charge for 12 months. Ratcliffe has reportedly been in contact with Southgate in recent weeks to gauge the possibility of him taking over, having been out of work since resigning as England manager in July 2024.",
      "The two other options that United reportedly have shortlisted are Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Southgate, 55, was heavily linked to the role prior to his England exit, and his name was also mentioned during the process of appointing Amorim, who could have four games to save his job.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Gareth Southgate has made it increasingly clear that he's decided to move away from football management. In December 2024, the former England boss told the BBC: \"I've been 37 years a player and coach, and I'm not against the next period of my life being totally different. When you've had one of the biggest jobs, how do you follow that up?\"",
      "\"Southgate's comments suggest that he's looking for leadership roles outside of football, as he's hinted at during other media appearances since leaving the Wembley hot seat. Perhaps Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trying to convince Southgate to change his mind, but without ex-FA chief Dan Ashworth on board at United, it seems far-fetched that Southgate would get the job at this point - if he even wants it.",
      "\"Some would argue, though, that United is an even bigger job than managing England, so maybe it is a worthy next role. But the stars don't feel aligned, and given Glasner and Iraola's current careers in the Premier League, they look more suitable candidates for what United are trying to build.\"",
      "The Manchester United hierarchy, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, remain in full support of Ruben Amorim, according to BBC Sport. Their report dismisses speculation that a shortlist has been drawn up, insisting that Old Trafford chiefs are fully backing the Portguese to turn things around.",
      "Ratcliffe feels that it's only fair to judge Amorim over the course of a full season with what the United co-owner views as the right squad to make progress. Sources add that no one is currently being lined up.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Sir Jim Ratcliffe is once again showing patience with a Manchester United manager. He allowed Erik ten Hag to continue despite a dreadful 2023-24 season, backing him with a summer of spending before ultimately pulling the plug, trusting fellow bigwigs Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada's judgement.",
      "\"But he's playing a dangerous game as ire builds up within the fan base. Constant false dawns are filling United supporters with apathy and if results don't improve, it'll only be a matter of time before things turn toxic at matches.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former France international Emmanuel Petit has previously claimed that Zinedine Zidane would need demands to be met before taking charge of Manchester United. The Champions League-winning head coach has been mentioned in the conversation to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure mounts.",
      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins as they failed to build on last weekend's triumph over Chelsea, with Brentford running out 3-1 winners on Saturday. Two first-half strikes from Igor Thiago gave the visitors a mountain to climb following a slow start in the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko reduced the arrears, netting his first for the club, before Bruno Fernandes squandered a golden opportunity from the spot to level proceedings 15 minutes from time.",
      "Mathias Jensen rounded off the scoring deep into stoppage to compound a miserable afternoon for the travelling United contingent.",
      "It leaves United in 14th on seven points as Keith Andrews' side leapfrogged them with their triumph.",
      "Amorim continues to face speculation over an exit after failing to arrest their inconsistency and poor form. It has led to Zidane being linked with the post, but should a decision be taken, they will have to coax the former Real Madrid head coach in from the cold.",
      "Zidane has not been in the dugout since 2021 after leaving Los Blancos for a second time. In order to do so, Petit, one of his former teammates, says demands will have to be met.",
      "\"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United,\" Petit said in 2024.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "He added: \"Could he manage to overturn the situation over there? I think the only answer is yes. But at the moment, when you look at the team, I'm not convinced at all about the level of some players.",
      "\"So if I am Zizou, I think it will be very easy, actually, to answer this question [of joining United]. If I don't speak English on top of it, that will be more problems in terms of communication in the dressing room.",
      "\"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid.",
      "\"I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "There have been mixed reports over whether Amorim’s position is under imminent threat but one thing is clear: results must start to improve.",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65.",
      "",
      "Of the 14 ever-presents through the first five games, no keeper has conceded fewer than the three goals Henderson has seen past him. As we’re certain he’d tell you.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list has done Trafford. Though the PSxG stat won’t account for the way he gave Tottenham the ball before their crucial second at the Etihad in his home debut for his boyhood club.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the highest saves percentage (84 per cent) in the league and only one keeper has made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",
      "Four clean sheets in five games – still the best record in the Premier League – is keeping Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. He bumped his PSxG up against Arsenal, though that stat won’t highlight his mistake in giving Arsenal back the ball prior to their late winner.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced five shots more than any other goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "Darlow has replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form has given Daniel Farke a decision to make when Perri becomes available again next weekend.",
      "",

      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic keeping clean sheets in half of his six appearances so far. All the more impressive when you consider that Bournemouth sold almost their entire defence.",
      "",
      "Leno is bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign. Villa scoring three from an xG of 1.11 has hurt the German here, but there is very little he could have done to prevent any of those goals.",
      "",
      "Only one keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 83.3%. Gary Neville would still prefer someone bigger.",
      "",
      "Perhaps this metric really is a nonsense because Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. At Chelsea, he looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys.",
      "",

      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they almost certainly have if we accept the Bees need some patience while a remodelled team settles under a new manager. Defeats – both 3-1 – at Forest and Fulham cost Kelleher here, with the Cottagers scoring three from an xG of 1.0. But saving Bruno Fernandes’ penalty certainly helps.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and, despite playing two games fewer than the ever-presents, no keeper has faced a higher PSxG per 90 (0.46) than the Dane. Hermansen has not convinced anyone at the London Stadium, and one of Nuno’s first acts was to bench him and reinstate Alphonse Areola.",
      "",
      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal has done for the £16million new boy here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle.

      "Another defeat for Manchester United prompted the inevitable handwringing and hilarity over the position a once-great club continues to find itself.",
      "The next obvious move for United would be to change their manager. Again. Given the lack of tangible improvement since he was appointed almost a year ago and the lack of optimism over a swift and dramatic reversal of their current fortunes, Ruben Amorim could have few arguments if he was handed his cards.",
      "Actually, he might gladly receive them. On numerous occasions, Amorim has presented as a manager aching to be put out of his misery, despite the outward defiance while steadfastly, stubbornly refusing to even consider that there may be good reasons why few clubs employ his formation of choice.",
      "Certainly, only United use it while so woefully ill-equipped. Amorim knows, but persists regardless, and so too do his bosses, if the noises coming out of Old Trafford are to be believed.",
      "Apparently, United are not thinking of dispensing with Amorim because Sir Jim Ratcliffe feels it is only fair to judge him after a full season with, as the BBC’s Simon Stone reports, the ‘right team’.",
      "Amorim may get a full season. But not one with the right team.",
      "How can it be when the individuals don’t fit the system? That was a very fair and reasonable excuse for the sh*t that was served through the second half of last season. But even after a full summer transfer window, United have failed to furnish Amorim with the players necessary to make his system work.",
      "We can all spend hours picking apart the components of Amorim’s United team – it’s how many get their kicks – but the flaws that really stand out: the absence of a No.1 goalkeeper, wing-backs of the necessary standard, a midfielder to hold it all together, and the redeployment of their best player in a wholly unsuitable role.",
      "Even if we look beyond the fact that Amorim is putting his devout faith in his system above the immediate needs of the team he is paid handsomely to improve, there are plenty of reasons to target the manager. But Amorim is taking all the bullets, providing cover for those who set him up to fail.",
      "Perhaps the root of many of United’s problems can be found in the layers between the manager and minority owner who remain the faces of the club’s failures. At what point do we look at Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and Christopher Vivell? And how would anyone ask: what the f*** are you doing, lads?",
      "Wilcox is United’s director of football. No one has really thought to question the power the solid-if-unspectacular ex-winger wields at one of the world’s biggest clubs. Except Dave Tickner, of course. Perhaps we ought to have scrutinised his ascent more rather than simply waving it through, just because it was said for so long that United needed a sporting director, it almost passed the point that it mattered who.",
      "MORE: Jason Wilcox is one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "Wilcox was initially technical director, working alongside Dan Ashworth before it was quickly realised that his face didn’t fit. So Wilcox stepped up – or across; given the lack of definition around these types of roles, it’s often hard to know for sure – to take overall responsibility for football operations at Old Trafford and Carrington.",
      "Wilcox was said to harbour concerns over Amorim’s suitability for the United job when the Red Devils first considered the Portuguese as a replacement for Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2024 prior to a U-turn on their decision to ditch the Dutchman. Before U-turning again less than three months into the season. Wilcox’s concerns: the level of recruitment required to make United 3-4-3 ready in a timely fashion; and the fact it is not a system that has regularly provided a foundation for success in the Premier League.",
      "When perhaps he ought to have trusted his instincts, Wilcox was swayed by Amorim, since it was him who led the process which identified the then-Sporting coach as the best man for the job.",
      "It is unclear how Amorim’s arrival impacted Wilcox’s quest to develop a ‘game model’, a clear and cohesive playing style that should permeate through the ranks at Carrington, but it seems that project has been shelved while United pin everything on a system their director of football never fancied anyway.",
      "If Wilcox did have doubts, then it explains why United were reluctant to fully equip Amorim with the players he needed in the summer. Perhaps Christopher Vivell could explain what happened there.",
      "He after all is United’s director of recruitment, a role he has held since summer 2024. No doubt United fans would relish the opportunity to ask the German why the club signed three forwards – two were needed, no question – but no midfielder in the summer; and why they opted against recruiting an experienced, proven goalkeeper. But the chances many supporters could pick Vivell out of a line-up are as slim as their title hopes.",
      "Few of these execs possess the kind of profile where they might be identified in the street. And there are reasons for that. The modern-day football club structure is still relatively new, evidenced by the fact that whenever a sporting director job comes up, it is always the same few names that are mentioned. With so few proven track records in the candidate pool, you can see the temptation in appointing your brother, son, agent, mate.",
      "New enough too that there is no provable link between visibility and competence. Especially when fighting with coaches, players and occasionally owners for the spotlight on a crowded stage only opens you up to greater scrutiny.",
      "Which highlights the contradiction with these roles: Wilcox, Vivell, Berrada and their peers at other clubs, all appear to wield more power than the managers and coaches – considerably so, in some cases – yet are too often unaccountable to anyone outside their boardroom.",
      "These are football’s cushiest gigs. Just as turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, why would any sporting director or recruitment guru volunteer to go on the record, even just to own their decisions if not to explain them?",
      "Managers must go before the media three times a game. In the Premier League, there is no obligation for those above them to put themselves out even once a season and, given the power they wield, that should change.",
      "Until it does, we are likely to hear scandalously little from Wilcox, Vivell and Berrada while they cower in the shadow of their shield, for now taking the form of a handsome-but-beleaguered Portuguese football coach.",
      "Arsenal want credit. But not too much credit. Are Liverpool and their new expensive attack still the favourites?",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer.",
      "The last manager Maresca wants at Stamford Bridge right now is Mourinho and we can’t imagine Konate is much more positive about the prospect of Osimhen.",
      "The Newcastle medical department is working overtime to expedite the recovery of their problem solver; Manchester United might get desperate soon too.",

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Arsenal) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Crystal Palace) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Spurs) – £45m",
      "5th (Sunderland) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Bournemouth) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester City) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Chelsea) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Brighton) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Fulham) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Leeds) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Everton) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Brentford) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Manchester United) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Newcastle) – £15.9m",

      "17th (Nottingham Forest) – £10.7m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",
      "=1st) Chelsea and Liverpool (11 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £9.13m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (10 games) – worth around £8.3m",
      "8th) Newcastle (9 games) – worth around £7.47m",
      "=9th) Brentford, Everton and West Ham (8 games) – worth around £6.64m",
      "12th) Leeds (7 games) – worth around £5.81m",
      "=13th) Brighton, Fulham and Wolves (6 games) – worth around £4.98m",
      "=17th) Bournemouth and Crystal Palace (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",

      "Instead, Rashford secured a loan move to Aston Villa and returned to form under Unai Emery, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, Amorim, Palace, Forest, Sunderland, Maresca, Buendia",
      "This boosted his chances of joining Barcelona in the window and they sanctioned a loan deal after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",

While reputable journalists write about how Guehi ‘dropped his head and walked off alone’ while ‘the rest of his team-mates ran over to celebrate’ with Ismaila Sarr after the first goal, Glasner, his captain and players have all knuckled down and reached a whole new level.",
      "This is a phenomenal team under a remarkable coach, players as comfortable chasing a goal as they are defending a lead, with full clarity about their roles and responsibilities in any game state.",
      "The title questions will be asked by those on the outside looking in because they have to be. But the only thing on the agenda internally is to keep pushing the boundaries of what this club and those of a similar size should be. Palace are not supposed to win trophies, play in Europe or beat the champions but each achievement has been entirely on merit and glass ceilings are being shattered each week.",
      "Guehi will have been disappointed at the breakdown of his Liverpool move, and there is every chance both he and Glasner depart this Palace project within the next year or two. But to be part of this piece of ongoing history must feel incredible – and it entirely vindicates some difficult business decisions.",
      "",
      "It does appear to have been embedded in the Brentford DNA to beat Manchester United at home, so Keith Andrews and his employers will know not to read too far into an ostensibly impressive result.",
      "But it is another tick against the name of a manager thrown in at the deep and and expected to survive. Brentford had a clear game plan with enough flexibility to adjust when needed. This is far from the scalp it once was but the Bees still had to take it.",
      "It will not always be as simple as Jordan Henderson thumping it long and Igor Thiago smashing one in off the post. But Brentford do seem to have rediscovered their home form and Andrews is halfway to matching Martin O’Neill for Premier League wins against Manchester United, which he will quietly enjoy.",
      "",
      "Those familiar with Regis Le Bris will know that two of his favourite words to use when discussing Sunderland are “solutions” and “connections”.",
      "Six games into his first season as a Premier League manager, him and his players seem to possess an abundance of both.",
      "Sunderland are picking up points in vastly different ways: from resounding counter-attacking victories to late comeback wins and obdurate defensive performances. They scored five goals and conceded three in their first three games for six points, then scored two and conceded one for five.",
      "Only Brighton and Fulham have gained more points from losing positions and Sunderland are one of just six clubs not to drop points from a winning position.",
      "Against Nottingham Forest, six summer signings started – not including the loanee made permanent in Enzo Le Fee – and looked as though they had played together for years. They have established the “connections” and Le Bris more often than not will find the “solutions”.",
      "",
      "More than a few strays have been aimed in his general direction already this season but Buendia has often seemed alone in his willingness to see Aston Villa’s situation as an opportunity rather than a predicament.",
      "While others have bemoaned the PSR overlords, complained about the shackles placed around them and wilfully ignored that ludicrous revenue-to-wage ratio, Buendia has sought to provide solutions instead of more problems.",
      "Already given about three times more Premier League minutes in 2025/26 than in the last two seasons combined, Buendia has knuckled down and maximised the chances which would never have fallen his way had Villa been able to spend what they please – and more importantly found a buyer for the Argentine as they had clearly hoped.",
      "Buendia’s mere presence in the side was for many a negative reflection of their squad-building issues in toeing the financial line. Even his introduction for Harvey Elliott against Fulham was polarising, a decision Unai Emery might have suspected would go down as well as a Fabian Delph tribute video at Villa Park.",
      "But within six minutes the mood was transformed as Buendia became the fastest half-time substitute in Premier League history by quite some margin to score and assist after coming off the bench.",
      "Emery was right to think his “energy” would help, but the key part is that Buendia “wanted to stay, be involved and work for Aston Villa”. That has not applied to many at the club since the summer but that win could turn the tide.",
      "",
      "The good doctor changed the prescription at the last second to a medication rather less transformative, but once it gets into Wolves’ system they should feel the benefits from simply stopping their losing run.",
      "On which note, Pereira was right to take heart from the fact Wolves “can play in different systems” now when the opponent or game state suits. Having not started with a four-at-the-back formation in the last 66 games of his coaching career, spanning reigns at two different clubs, the 57-year-old has showed he can change to deliver a deserved win and spirited draw.",
      "A relegation-adjacent Portuguese manager who has received undue backing from the owners, displaying tactical flexibility and a willingness to compromise when the need to do so has become painfully obvious? It’ll never catch on.",
      "",
      "The split in the Brighton fanbase between Fabian fanatics and Hurzeler haters might never fade. That comes with the territory of a 32-year-old manager essentially learning on the Premier League job at a club whose motto is the Latin translation of ‘upwards mobility thanks to Paul Barber’s laptop’.",
      "The critics and supporters can agree on one thing: whether Brighton are winning, losing or drawing, Hurzeler’s substitutions are game-changing.",
      "He turned defeat into victory against Manchester City after sensing a shift in momentum, conjured one point out of three with needlessly defensive changes against Spurs, and capitalised on Chelsea’s apparent desperation to surrender any match once they have a player sent off.",
      "The Trevoh Chalobah red card was transformative but only because Hurzeler made it so. All three goals were scored or assisted by one of his substitutes.",
      "",
      "It will only be solidified when Pep Guardiola aggressively and performatively remonstrates with him on the pitch at full time but as the Spaniard said of his “unstoppable” forward, Doku is “an incredible threat against teams that are a low block and deep” and his decision-making has improved markedly.",
      "Doku racked up 13 carries into the penalty area against Burnley. Only Yankuba Minteh (21) and Jack Grealish (19) have registered more in the Premier League across the entirety of the current season.",
      "And ten goals or assists in 14 games for club and country since the June internationals does suggest that end product is being supplied more reliably by a player whose floor and ceiling at the Etihad has often resided in different postcodes.",
      "",
      "Only the second teenager ever to score a Premier League goal for Bournemouth – and Football Manager enthusiasts would be willing to bet good money that he follows the same sort of career trajectory as Dean Huijsen.",
      "The Cherries will take their time with Kroupi; keeping him on loan at Lorient for the rest of last season after signing him in January underlined how he was more for the future than the present.",
      "But Bournemouth will not regret unwrapping him early. The runaway top scorer in Ligue 2 last campaign is up and running in the Premier League, obviously with his shirt removed.",
      "",
      "The first player ever to score in consecutive Premier League games twice under Scott Parker. The knighthood is in the post.",
      "Anthony has 32 matches left to find the two goals which will take him past Bobby De Cordova-Reid as the highest scorer in a single top-flight season for Parker. The race is on.",
      "",
      "Only Arsenal, Brighton (both eight) and Liverpool (seven) have had more different scorers in the Premier League this season than Leeds, who will need such variation and shared responsibility in attack when that version of Dominic Calvert-Lewin shows up.",
      "Daniel Farke and company would understandably prefer to forget the Carabao Cup disaster against Sheffield Wednesday but Jayden Bogle’s goal in that shoot-out defeat means seven players have scored precisely once for Leeds in this season’s hottest Golden Boot race.",
      "",
      "After a 17th defeat in 33 Premier League games which have garnered 34 points, Manchester United are left entirely alone in thinking this could work. And even those inside the club drinking from a half-full glass are only doing so because of how badly the inevitable would reflect on them.",
      "It is a phrase used frequently on these pages but one which becomes more relevant with each defeat: this is Sunk Cost Fallacy FC, sacrificing results, performances and dignity at the arrogant altar of not only Ruben Amorim, but those responsible for his appointment.",
      "This falls on Amorim, on Jason Wilcox, on Omar Berrada, on Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The players too, of course, for these are ultimately their losses, their reputations being shredded, their livelihoods reduced to weekly ridicule and derision in front of the world.",
      "Manchester United have backed Amorim to such a ludicrous extent that he cannot simply be sacked without every other element of their footballing operation coming into question, without the very edifice of their grand plan collapsing in on itself.",
      "That helps explain why Amorim is still there. That old Ratcliffe quote about employing “the right people” who are “best in class in all aspects of football” comes to mind once or twice a week, no more so than when watching his side be outcoached by a first-time manager of a club which was plundered in the summer, including for the £71m forward Manchester United ended up playing at wing-back while chasing a deficit.",
      "Accepting that the head coach they have yielded so heavily to is not even vaguely “the right people” or “best in class” would prompt too many uncomfortable questions as to who at Old Trafford precisely is. On current evidence, no-one comes close.",
      "",
      "It is all starting to feel a little bit Roberto Martinez at Everton, but without the year of slightly misleading brilliance in between.",
      "Perhaps it is easier for a trophy-winning, attack-minded coach to inherit and build upon a sound defensive structure in the summer with a pre-season than it is to oversee that drastic metamorphosis in the middle of a campaign.",
      "Maybe that transition is also far better as a natural process in replacing a headhunted manager rather than sacking an overachieving coach who is popular with the squad.",
      "Martinez was able to elevate Everton’s attacking platform for a while before the instincts and muscle memory in the squad David Moyes left behind started to wear off. Ange Postecoglou has not yet been able to make sense of the myriad forwards he has come into possession of, and the regression to the defensive mean which had started under Nuno Espirito Santo has only been accelerated.",
      "Forest had not kept a clean sheet in 11 games under Nuno, their last coming against Manchester United in April. Postecoglou is without one in 17 Premier League matches, his last coming against Manchester United in February. That is, as ever, reason to laugh at Manchester United, but also the club which chose to engineer this unnecessary mess.",
      "And again, it is not as if security has been sacrificed for entertainment. Forest are conceding as frequently and scoring considerably less often, just with far more of the ball.",
      "Before this season the most possession they had managed in a Premier League game since promotion three years ago was 61%. Postecoglou has already beaten that mark twice and garnered a single point for it against sides who have just come up from the Championship.",
      "",
      "The world is slowly realising Maresca’s ideal game state.",
      "The Italian revealed after the Manchester United defeat that he would “prefer to be 1-0 down after three minutes than one player down”. It can probably be assumed that he would also rather it be 1-1 with 11 men after 53 minutes instead of leading 1-0 with ten.",
      "An obvious solution would be for his players to stop putting themselves into situations whereby such a crucial snap decision has to be made. Robert Sanchez, Andrey Santos and Trevoh Chalobah have all made diabolical calls in consecutive weeks, compounding systemic mistakes with individual errors.",
      "But Maresca must understand the message his reaction sends out. He surrendered to Manchester United after a matter of minutes and seemed to instantly accept a fate Chelsea could still have avoided against Brighton.",
      "Three defenders and Romeo Lavia were brought on for Santos, Estevao, Jorrel Hato and Pedro Neto in the 40 minutes or so after that red. Having a player sent off is sub-optimal but it only automatically equates to a defeat through the manager’s response.",
      "",
      "As Arne Slot said, “we can only blame ourselves” and the opponent “deserved to win”.",
      "Liverpool have probably been spoiled in that respect. Those six exhilarating victories, the majority of which were delivered through late winners, bred that some monster mentality Jurgen Klopp used to revel in harnessing. It creates a team that never knows when it is beaten, that always sense the game is there to be won.",
      "Perhaps that is where Slot will benefit from a little more self-analysis.",
      "“One of our players ran out because he wanted to play a counter-attack, which was of no use because time was up, so it was only about defending,” he said after the Palace defeat. “One player was too offensively minded in that moment, which led to them scoring the winner and us losing the game.”",
      "It was a situation which had echoes of the opening weekend when Jamie Carragher pushed Slot on Liverpool committing players forward at the wrong times, and something the Reds will be more minded than ever to work on now their vulnerabilities have been exposed.",
      "",
      "There is admittedly not a great deal of shame in losing to Liverpool, Barcelona and Arsenal, especially with those two Premier League defeats being meted out in the depths of second-half stoppage time.",
      "But there remain concerns over Newcastle’s attacking output and two league defeats at St James’ Park is already as many as they suffered throughout the whole of 2022/23, one off their 2023/24 total and just three behind last season.",
      "It is heartening that Eddie Howe chose to focus on those collective shortcomings going forward, the general effort of his players and how Arsenal were ultimately better, steadfastly refusing the referee-blaming olive branch offered post match. Newcastle need introspection rather than excuses right now.",
      "",
      "It just had to be. The Spurs of last season do probably lose that through some absurd hilarity like a Richarlison overhead kick own goal, so the progress under Thomas Frank remains clear.",
      "But so too does the room for improvement. Spurs are struggling to create chances and no-one is currently available to reliably convert them in any event.",
      "",
      "It is a phenomenal bit that Fulham’s longest winning run in the Premier League since January 2023 is still two entire games, and that at absolutely no point in those intervening years have they been even vaguely concerned by the threat of relegation.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate is “definitely” someone that Man Utd are “looking at” to replace Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal want credit. But not too much credit. Are Liverpool and their new expensive attack still the favourites?",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…",
      "It is wrong that Jason Wilcox wields more power at Man Utd than Ruben Amorim but, like so many other club execs in the Premier League, faces a fraction of ...",
      "It is now ‘when and not if’ Man Utd will sack Ruben Amorim after the Red Devils hierarchy requested a change of formation, according to reports.",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer."

      "Shearer picked up on his scattergun approach to staging a comeback and was in disbelief at how many changes he made in terms of players in positions, all while sticking with his beloved formation that clearly isn’t working.",
      "A lack of adaptability, or desire to adapt, will be what costs Amorim his job, Shearer has said. And the Premier League’s all-time leading goalscorer has labeled his tactics against Keith Andrews’ side as “alarming”.",

      "Pundit Alan Shearer has revealed why he thinks Ruben Amorim hasn’t been sacked by Manchester United, with his axe to be a “terrible look” for INEOS.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd have had a disastrous eleven months as they have only won 19 of their 49 matches in all competitions.",
      "The Red Devils suffered their latest defeat against Brentford on Saturday afternoon, losing 3-1 thanks to a brace from Igor Thiago and a late strike from Mathias Jensen.",
      "This result leaves United 14th in the table as Amorim appears to be on the brink as the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Shearer and Gary Lineker gave a damning assessment of Man Utd’s loss against Brentford, with the Newcastle United legend claiming that Amorim was “out-schooled” by novice boss Keith Andrews.",
      "“Just one long ball over the top, and they’re in desperate trouble. And they’ve not come into grips with that system,” Lineker said on The Rest is Football podcast.",
      "READ: Amorim £13.5m sack incoming with ‘shaman’ touted as next Man Utd manager",
      "“It seems to me, still, they don’t have the players, or they’ve not really brought in the players that fit in that system. He’s keep saying he’s not going to change.",
      "“Brentford knew exactly how to play against them, because I’ve voiced my concerns for United before on this, that if you play a certain way, and you’re never prepared to change it, and you actually tell everybody you’re not going to change it, so everybody knows how you’re going to play, well, it’s easy to plan to play against them, isn’t it, right? Brentford had their plan, didn’t they?”",
      "Shearer responded: “Brentford without doubt had their plan? He was out-schooled by Keith Andrews, and what Brentford did. That will be his downfall.",
      "“It really will be his downfall, unfortunately for him, because he’s not going to budge. He’s right, everyone else is wrong, I guess. I know they worked really hard last week for their win, but it was back to normality.”",
      "After Lineker suggested that the Red Devils got “lucky” against Chelsea due to Robert Sanchez’s red card, Shearer explained why he thinks Amorim remains in charge at Old Trafford, claiming INEOS won’t take to “admit another error”.",
      "“But then Casemiro got sent off and they had to work really hard. I said last week that at least he knows that his players are still working hard for him,” Shearer explained.",
      "“But I did say on Match of the Day last night, that when you look at the Graham Potter situation at West Ham, which I’m sure will mention, 26% win and he’s been fired for that, he’s got 27% win rate, despite the fortunes that have been spent at Manchester United and currently, I think the last time I looked they’re 14th or 15th in the Premier League, despite all the money that’s been spent?",
      "“I also said that I genuinely believe that the owners, or the people are running the club at the minute, have made that many errors in the last two years or 18 months since they’ve been there, it would look terrible to admit another error.",
      "“And secondly, whether you look at the Dan Ashworth, whether you look at the ticket increase, whether you look at people losing their jobs, whether you look at the new stadium, whether you look at paying for Dan Ashworth and then sacking him, and then he’s contract being paid up, then for them to go and say, ‘Actually, we went hell bent on getting this manager and paying a fee for him and demanding he comes now, rather than when he wanted to come’ for them now say you’re firing him, and then pay out another huge chunk of wedge to for someone to lose their contract.",
      "“I genuinely believe that’s probably one of the reasons why he’s still there, because they’re not they’re not any better, They’re not getting any better. They look miles off it. And if he’s not going to change, which clearly he said he’s not, then that will be his downfall.”",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate is “definitely” someone that Man Utd are “looking at” to replace Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "It is now ‘when and not if’ Man Utd will sack Ruben Amorim after the Red Devils hierarchy requested a change of formation, according to reports.",
      "Carragher says Man Utd are “only waiting for the inevitable” and told them to sack Amorim “as quickly as possible” as his appointment has “been a disaster” for everyone involved.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs have reached a verdict on whether to sack head coach Ruben Amorim, with the ‘dressing room astonished’.",
      "One Sir Jim Ratcliffe quote helps explain why Ruben Amorim is still at Man Utd. Maresca and Liverpool messed up but Arsenal, Palace and Sunderland impressed.",
      "Ruben Amorim did something “alarming” during Manchester United’s defeat at Brentford, says Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer."

      "Let me tell you something you already know: VAR has institutionalised ignorance and stupidity whilst selling itself as informed and clever. If you somehow didn’t realise that, Saturday’s Brentford v Manchester United game must surely have proved it to you.",
      "But what is VAR really? More than just an extra rule to obey, it has altered the very fabric of the game and installed a dark cloak of fear after every goal is scored, as they scour the footage desperately trying to find a reason to disallow it. And they often find something which ‘proves’ there was a miniscule offside, invisible to the naked eye, that could only be discerned in slow motion. The striker gained no advantage, but nonetheless it’s ruled out. Even though the offside rule was invented to stop a player gaining advantage by being ahead of the ball, not to find a boot ahead of the ball by an inch which doesn’t gain an advantage and can’t even be seen with the naked eye.",
      "Great moments are spoiled by its presence, like when Fulham scored a great headed goal at Aston Villa. Even though it wasn’t disallowed, there was still a wait while it was assessed and that markedly reduces what should have been a great moment. It almost feels like you’ve got to ask if you’re allowed to score. Why do we even allow this intrusion? The rest of football gets by without it; why do the top leagues have to endure a patently flawed system?",
      "It’s put perversion at the game’s core, not fairness. In fact it has clearly made the game less fair. As we typically saw at Brentford, it took three minutes to decide Nathan Collins had not stopped a goalscoring opportunity by pulling Bryan Mbeumo eight yards from goal but nonetheless that it was enough for a penalty yet not enough to qualify as a goalscoring opportunity, so it wasn’t a red card, even though it was a goalscoring opportunity. If that doesn’t illustrate the pathetic nonsense of the system to you, nothing will.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, not the most emotionally stable player at the best of times, was left to think about the enormity of the task ahead. The weight of the occasion was ignored, Fernandes was broken on the back of ‘getting it right’.",
      "MAILBOX: Amorim is done, Bruno was ‘awful’ and Man Utd are ‘trash’ but what about the ‘two VAR shockers’?",
      "A system designed to help officials has made them palpably worse. Of course it has. They actually look smaller, neutered and pathetic. A weedy Walter on a field of Dennis the Menaces.",
      "I actually feel sorrow for them through my rage. What are they even for now? It looks like they don’t even know. If the guidance is to go with the on-field decision where possible, that doesn’t happen because ‘going with the on-field decision’ means the referee’s performance is being judged in real time, which in turn makes them paranoid they’ll get something wrong, which means they will, which will then make VAR intervene. On Saturday they took five minutes to decide the referee was right in the first place.",
      "It was said that it would fix blatant mistakes, but Sunderland were awarded a dubious free-kick which led to a goal (after the inevitable scrutiny for a miniscule offside). Forest have every reason to think that free-kick should not have been allowed. VAR failed to legitimise contentious decisions and left everyone feeling cheated. Exactly the opposite of what is supposed to happen.",
      "Time and again they won’t rule on things that happen in a phase before a goal but will rule on the goal, thus compounding their inadequacy. Get a free-kick unfairly but when that leads to a goal, it is ruled offside by a knee. Everyone hates it. Dissatisfaction is absolute.",
      "Decisions to correct mistakes are declared to be out of the remit of VAR, as if one phase of football can be divorced from the next. Yet things in their remit are called wrongly or take forever or are against the spirit of the game. And what is handball now? It used to be simple. But now they can’t decide and unfair decisions are made all the time. People have got so used to the confusion that have even stopped questioning it.",
      "That explosion of emotion when a goal is scored has been ruined, the groan of despair has replaced it. And people thought this was a good idea. Every round of games is dominated by terrible VAR and refereeing decisions. The overall standard has obviously dropped with the introduction of VAR. The stats will tell you more decisions are called right, but that’s only because they’ve defined what is correct. The offside knee decision can be called correct but it’s a bad decision.",
      "We’ve lost the soul and heart of football and turned it into a fussy, pathetic and often just as incorrect sport. At Brentford we saw how their actions can affect the result. VAR is altering the table, it’s become that pernicious. And as we see sweating referees wandering the pitch waiting to be told in his ear what to do as the players cool down and risk tearing a muscle, is there a more heinous, tragic and impotent sight in football?",
      "There was nothing wrong with football when various idiots insisted it be introduced. Unquestioningly it’s made the game worse but the money in football is almost entirely from TV and they bloody love it. Football as content provider rather than sport is the new normal. Stay tuned for more of the same coming right up after the break.",
      "Arsenal want credit. But not too much credit. Are Liverpool and their new expensive attack still the favourites?",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…",
      "It is wrong that Jason Wilcox wields more power at Man Utd than Ruben Amorim but, like so many other club execs in the Premier League, faces a fraction of ...",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer.",
      "The last manager Maresca wants at Stamford Bridge right now is Mourinho and we can’t imagine Konate is much more positive about the prospect of Osimhen.",
      "The Newcastle medical department is working overtime to expedite the recovery of their problem solver; Manchester United might get desperate soon too."

      "",
      "If Sir Alex was right, and you learn more from defeats than you do from victories, is Amorim the most knowledgeable manager around?",
      "No. He’s rubbish. 17 losses in 33 games. Get him gone. There’s literally no more words left to say on him, and every defence is full of obvious holes. Just like the one he sets up.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "I had largely fallen out of love with football but the decision of my 10-year-old son to start supporting Man Utd has dragged me back in. Suffice it to say, it has been miserable watching him suffer. All he has known is this dross.",
      "What is striking is how, no matter what Utd try, they fail. They have tried a Fergie mould (Moyes), a legend of the game (Van Gaal), the winning bastard (Mourinho), the good vibes guy (Solskjaer), methodical tacticians (Rangnick and Ten Hag) and now young hotshot (Amorim). And they’ve also thrown literal billions of pounds at it. But nothing seems to work.",
      "It is, of course, reminiscent of Liverpool’s fall from grace in the 90s and their long years in the wilderness. It’s not quite the same and less money was involved but still the parallel is reasonable. No matter what Liverpool tried it just didn’t seem to work. More than that they seemed “unlucky”. How else to explain Gerrard’s slip in 2015 that ended up giving away the one decent chance they’d had at the title in 25 years? The poor man had only delivered a rousing speech to his teammates admonishing them specifically not to let their title lead slip. He meant it figuratively but the universe took it literally and threw him on his arse. It was sheer banter just like it is now with Utd. No matter who they buy, no matter how well they play (it happens occasionally), they still fall on their arse. They seem, as it were, “cursed”.",
      "For Liverpool, though, that curse was lifted and I think often about how that happened.",
      "There was, of course, Fenway taking over and introducing sabermetrics that resulted in a wonderful recruitment programme. A well-run club is no doubt important but that does not lift curses. For that you need a shaman. And so, Liverpool hired one.",
      "Jurgen Klopp was the most remarkable football figure I had ever seen. Tall, loud, a grin like a madman, an exuberance like a bear high on honey, he dominated every room or stadium he walked into. I realise now that when he famously forced the Liverpool team to salute the fans after a miserable draw against West Brom early in his tenure he was actually performing an exorcism. He was grabbing the club by the scruff of the neck and shaking out all the trauma, all the scars and all the suffering so they could start again. He transfused belief into the players and the fans through sheer personality. While other managers were devising gameplans he was performing rituals. The success came later but that West Brom game was when the magic started.",
      "And that now is what Man Utd need. They don’t need a tactician or an organiser. They need a shaman like Klopp. They need a talismanic figure who can root out the negativity that has infected the club to its core and instil in everyone the belief needed to grow and return to success. They need someone who can perform spiritual surgery on their very soul.",
      "Unfortunately, these people are in short supply. You don’t learn this stuff on your UEFA Pro Licence course and Klopp himself is out of the question even though he’s exactly what Utd need. My head tells me Glasner should be appointed when Amorim is given the boot but another name draws my attention.",
      "Gareth Southgate is not Klopp. He is as uninspiring a prospect now as he was when he somehow got the England job. And yet, he did work out (sort of). England got to two major finals and a World cup semi. He did something right even though that something didn’t appear to be tactical or organisational. Rather, he helped move England past something. They won a knockout penalty shootout. More than that, the players seemed…happy? They played with a freedom and verve, liberated seemingly from the psychological dungeon the national team had been locked in for several decades themselves. He even seemed “lucky”, with England apparently receiving favourable draws in tournaments.",
      "In other words, despite not having anything like Klopp’s charisma or presence, Southgate dragged his team out of a psychological hole – a bigger one perhaps even than that inhabited by either Liverpool or Man Utd.",
      "So, maybe, just maybe, despite every indication to the contrary, Southgate is exactly what Utd need right now.",

      "Enough so for the ‘eye-watering’ pay-off to be revealed, at least. But at around £12m there have been far more expensive conscious uncouplings in dugouts across the world. Although mainly at Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "With the realisation having finally dawned about halfway into a three-year contract that Emery and Arsenal were incompatible, the decision was made to part and replace the Spaniard with the far more suitable manager whose appointment they bottled in the first place.",
      "",
      "It should forever go down as one of the more absurdly diabolical managerial succession plans in history. Manchester United let Ten Hag survive an internal review, oversee another £200m worth of signings he wanted or had previously worked with, sacked him a couple of months into the season and somehow found someone even worse to take his job.",

      "Even though the Russian Football Union was in significant debt to the point that billionaire Alisher Usmanov had loaned them £3.9m for some unpaid wages owed to Capello, it was felt that one of the more financially lucrative contracts in international football should have been worth more than a dreadful start to Euro 2016 qualifying which put Russia eight points behind Austria and four off the pace of Sweden in their group.",

      "It was described in official communications as a ‘joint agreement’ but a sizeable pay-off suggests something slightly less than mutual terminated Mancini’s £21m-a-year deal with the Saudis, who felt their chances of qualification for the 2026 World Cup were in jeopardy.",
      "",
      "“I would have liked that things happened in a different manner as it was a bit brutal,” said Blanc, whose alternate timeline would presumably still have included that healthy bank transfer. He was the most PSG of managers, winning 11 of a possible 15 trophies in three seasons but never advancing past the Champions League quarter-finals.",

      "How different things might have turned out if the £20m paid to Pochettino and his staff had been set aside for an actual incoming transfer at any point between February 2018 and July 2019.",
      "",
      "The hat-trick is complete. Mourinho has made a small fortune out of burning bridges and scorching earth, with a gargantuan pay-off marking his first divorce from Chelsea. It was another expensive mutual consenting less than halfway through a five-year contract extension he signed in 2005.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s own financial accounts listed “exceptional items of £26.6 million” relating to “changes in respect of the men’s team management and coaching staff, together with associated legal costs” after finally reaching a settlement with Conte over what was later judged to be an unfair dismissal. The Italian was ‘disgusted’ – and that was before he took over at Spurs.",
      "We can’t spend our whole lives laughing at Manchester United; sometimes we have to doff caps to the clubs smashing this football lark.",
      "Arsenal want credit. But not too much credit. Are Liverpool and their new expensive attack still the favourites?",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…",
      "It is wrong that Jason Wilcox wields more power at Man Utd than Ruben Amorim but, like so many other club execs in the Premier League, faces a fraction of ...",

But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",

We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",

      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "Arsenal defender Gabriel's 'handball' and his collision with Newcastle's Nick Woltemade also analysed on Ref Watch; other incidents include Mo Salah's handball and an incorrect award of a corner that led to a Crystal Palace goal, plus Malo Gusto's high boot and Trevoh Chalobah's red card",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 10:23, UK",
      "Brentford's Nathan Collins was lucky not to see red against Manchester United, said Dermot Gallagher on Ref Watch, as Jay Bothroyd described the decision not to send him off as \"baffling\".",
      "Read on for Gallagher and Bothroyd's thoughts on the weekend's action...",
      "INCIDENT: The decision was made not to send off Collins after he conceded a penalty. VAR checked the yellow card shown to Collins after a penalty was given, but they agreed with the referee's decision with Bryan Mbuemo deemed to be not in control of the ball.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Nathan got really, really lucky. The VAR would have looked at it and decided Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "\"Nathan panics. He pulls his shirt and if he doesn't do that, Mbeumo, who got a touch to the ball, would have got it. He's got a clear goalscoring opportunity eight yards out.",
      "\"They looked at it, looked at it and looked at it. I have a theory that your gut takes over. You look at a replay and you make up your mind. The more you look at it, the more you doubt yourself.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"It baffles me. Mbeumo is not in control of the ball because he's not going to control it.",
      "\"He's going to hit that first time. The pace is on the cross and all he is going to do is redirect the ball towards the corner.",
      "\"He's not going to control that in a million years.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR Darren England intervenes after referee Jarred Gillett awarded a penalty to Arsenal after Nick Pope appeared to foul Viktor Gyokeres. The referee changed his mind after looking at the screen and overturned the decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",
      "\"Pope does get a touch on the ball. My immediate instinct was penalty... but Pope does plant his foot so he doesn't follow through with the tackle so that's why it was overturned.",
      "\"This year, they've tried to stick with the on-field decision as much as possible, but once the VAR looks at it, he's decided that Pope has played the ball - that's the key factor.",
      "\"He's sent the referee to the screen but he can still hold his ground. He can still say it's a penalty. Referees take everything into consideration - where the ball is going, the direction of play, would the player have got it?\"",
      "On the similarities with the Robert Sanchez incident from the previous weekend: \"It was different. He touches the ball and follows through with the tackle... with the Pope one, he touches the ball but he plants his foot and does no more.",
      "\"Pope does not go into Gyokeres. He's stopping.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Newcastle's appeals for a penalty for handball against Gabriel were turned down by Gillett. VAR checked the incident but stuck with the on-field decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"This is a really interesting decision.",
      "\"The rule is that if the ball strikes your body and flies up onto your arm, it's not going to be given because it is not possible to get out of the way.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gabriel also escaped punishment after a clash with Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Gabriel is lucky he doesn't actually strike Woltemade properly.",
      "\"Where he is lucky is the referee hasn't seen it. It's gone to VAR and they don't think it's a red card. I don't think it's a red card.",
      "\"The referee has seen something has happened and what he does well is he calms them down and takes the sting out of the incident.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Trevoh Chalobah was sent off after a VAR review for the denying of a goalscoring opportunity with a foul on Diego Gomez.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I wonder whether Simon Hooper initially thought he caught him with his shoulder, but he's definitely tripped him.",
      "\"Gomez got across the defender and he's in the ascendancy. Once he's got there, the defender clips him and it's a red card.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR said no penalty as Malo Gusto's boot looks to have made contact with Yankuba Minteh's head.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think penalty. Once you raise a foot that high, you run a massive risk. He catches him.",
      "\"VAR looked and said there's no conclusive evidence that he's caught him.\"",
      "INCIDENT: There was a long check on Liverpool's equaliser. Federico Chiesa was the scorer, but VAR looked at whether Mo Salah had handballed it in the process and eventually ruled the goal out.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I honestly don't know about this one. I usually have a gut reaction when I look at a replay and then I make up my mind.",
      "\"I've looked at this again this morning, I looked yesterday and on Saturday, and I still can't tell if he's handled the ball.",
      "\"In that case, unless you are convinced he's handled the ball, play on.\"",
      "Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"I think it's handball. I've seen different angles, I've seen it slowed down, and it looks like it has hit his hand.",
      "\"It even looks like it has put off the defender. He's not able to get a full head on the ball and that's how you can tell it has hit his hand. Liverpool got away with one.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Crystal Palace's first goal came from a corner awarded in error - it should have been a goal kick. Why can't VAR intervene?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The referee doesn't see it because he's behind the play and he doesn't see it strike (Tyrick) Mitchell, with the assistant on the other side and that's why it's unlucky.",
      "\"This probably happens once a game that something goes the wrong way but it becomes vocal because it leads to a goal.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",

      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",

      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",

      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 12:31, UK",
      "Jamie Redknapp believes Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea is the biggest win of Ruben Amorim's reign at Old Trafford, while the Portuguese head coach has called for his side to build on their newfound momentum.",
      "United raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro following a red card for Robert Sanchez, but the result was thrown into question when the Brazil midfielder picked up his second yellow of the evening.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back for Chelsea with 10 minutes to go but Amorim's side held on - thanks to a defensive performance that Luke Shaw described as \"desperate\" after the game - to secure a much-needed win.",
      "United headed into the fixture with just four points from as many games, their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, but pressure will now be momentarily alleviated on Amorim and his squad after what was described by Redknapp as their \"biggest win\" since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "\"This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "United broke into the top half as a result of their win against Chelsea, with games against Brentford and Sunderland now on the horizon before the October international break.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim remained level-headed regarding his team's performance and called for them to create momentum moving forward.",
      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "Pressure had been ramped up on Amorim and his side in the build-up to the visit of Chelsea, which arrived as the following fixture to a dismal 3-0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",
      "The United boss continued: \"People don't have too many good things to say about our team and our results.",
      "\"I understand that, I'm just joking around all the time. I have nothing to say to the critics; they are right most of the time. But we won, and that's a good thing for us.",
      "\"It's really important because I understand the environment around the team and the coach. This game was really important for that. It's Manchester United winning a game at home, it's just that.\"",
