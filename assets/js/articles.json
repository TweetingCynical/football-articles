      "Liam Delap is set to imminently decide on his future after meeting interested clubs. The coming days will likely see the Ipswich Town forward confirm his departure from the club to remain in the Premier League.",
      "The ex-Manchester City youngster is available for £30million, due to a relegation clause placed in his contract after moving to Portman Road last summer. Delap was given permission by the Tractor Boys to hold discussions with suitors who are willing to stump up that fee.",
      "Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Everton have all made their case to the 22-year-old striker and Delap is now weighing up his options. The transfer window opens for the first time this summer on June 10.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have agreed the framework of a deal for the young forward, including an outline of personal terms with Delap's representatives, as first reported by ESPN.. A deal could move quickly should the England youth international choose to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Delap scored 12 goals in 36 games in his first Premier League season as Ipswich could not prevent relegation. The striker's reputation only grew however after he completed his £20m move last summer.",
      "Delap and his family have a good relationship with United's technical director Jason Wilcox from their time together at Manchester City when Wilcox was in charge of youth teams. The ex-Blackburn midfielder worked throughout the academy before becoming the academy director where he stayed until 2023.",
      "Chelsea can also offer some familiarity for Delap, with ex-Manchester City under-21s coach Enzo Maresca in charge at Stamford Bridge. Recruitment director Joe Shield also worked at the Etihad as part of the academy's talent management set-up.",
      "Earlier this season, Maresca spoke highly of Delap. The Blues' head coach said: “In terms of numbers, he's doing fantastic. I think he's scored 12 [Premier League] goals already.",
      "“It's not just in terms of his numbers — [it’s] the way he plays and fights and is always there. But he's an Ipswich player. He's an enemy on Sunday because we need to beat them, and then after the game I wish him all the best for the future.",
      "“In the first game, he was quite good for them. We need to deal with that, and we need to do much, much better compared to the first game [the loss at Ipswich].”",
      "Everton boss David Moyes have not given up hope of landing Delap however. Speaking last week he said: “He's spoken to three or four clubs and you know, he's given us the opportunity to pitch our case.",
      "“We're probably a little bit behind the black ball, but you never know what happens.”",

      "It’s fair to say the alarm bells have been ringing for Ruben Amorim for a while now.",
      "The Manchester United manager began his press conference to promote Tuesday's post season friendly against the mighty ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur with an apology after his phone burst into life. “First of all, I want to apologise for the house alarm,” said Amorim. “When I’m away, I like to control my kids!”",
      "Amorim is getting used to saying sorry. Addressing the fans at Old Trafford on the pitch after Sunday’s final-day 2-0 victory over Aston Villa, the Portuguese apologised for their disastrous, trophyless campaign, which saw United finish 15th in the league.",
      "Little wonder he was so keen to close the book on 2024/25, even if it has been extended by United’s money-spinning jaunt to the Far East, with another match in Hong Kong to come on Friday. “It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,” said Amorim.",
      "“I closed that chapter, I’m excited, I’m nervous, I want to work towards the next season. I don’t have that feeling to disconnect. I had the feeling to close the season, but now it’s a new season. I don’t need rest.”",
      "There will be precious little time for the United boss to spend on the sunlounger this summer - not when a major rebuild is required. Failure to beat Tottenham in the Europa League final closed the door on the Champions League and with it a potential £100million windfall.",
      "But a £62.5m deal to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is close to being rubber-stamped, while they continue to be linked with more forwards in the shape of Ipswich’s Liam Delap and Bryan Mbeumo of Brentford. Landing that trio would stretch United’s PSR restrained spending to the limit.",
      "And Amorim’s admission they “cannot do much” to improve their squad after their worst campaign since they were relegated in 1974 suggests doing so may currently be beyond their means. Hence why United are ready to listen to offers for any of their players, despite Amorim’s insistence skipper Bruno Fernandes is vital to his plans.",
      "“Omar (Berrada, the chief executive) is here, he can explain better than me,” Amorim said. “We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League.",
      "“Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course. But our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future. It was the past, so can be the future.",
      "“It’s not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",
      "“It’s important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.”",
      "A leaner, meaner squad is the plan. And Amorim once again claimed the lack of European football may prove to be a blessing in disguise.",
      "“I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better, to prepare better for the games, to build that work that we need for the future,” he reasoned. \"I think it’s a good thing for us to take advantage, not to have European games.”",
      "He better be right, otherwise those alarm bells will soon become too loud to ignore.",

Recorder Eric Lamb also banned Williams from driving for three years and ordered him to complete 180 hours of unpaid work as part of a community order.",
      "“I would like to thank my legal team headed by Richard Littler KC and Philip Williams of Blackfords LLP for establishing that I was not under the influence of any substance at the time of the accident,” Williams said.",
      "“I have always accepted that my driving that day fell below the standard that is expected of me. It was never my intention to cause injury to anyone but I am responsible for the standard of my driving. I make no excuses. I have learnt from this experience and will ensure there is no repetition.",
      "“I wish to apologise again to those who were involved in the accident. Now that the case has concluded I look forward to resuming my career with a new team later this year.”",
      "Williams has not played since a loan spell at Ipswich Town, with his most recent appearance coming against QPR in late December 2023.",

      "United have been on a cost-cutting mission since Ratcliffe took over control of sporting operations in February 2024, with the petrochemicals billionaire slashing hundreds of jobs, including the ambassadorial role for legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Ratcliffe has made it clear that he believes he inherited an inefficient club which has been wasting money across the board.",

      "Ruben Amorim was summoned to Monaco for crunch talks in the wake of Manchester United’s defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. United’s season ended in disaster, with Spurs’ 1-0 win in Bilbao denying them a place in the Champions League and making a crucial summer of recruitment more difficult.",
      "After a dreadful domestic campaign, which saw them finish 15th following a contentious 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day, United were counting on the Europa League to offer solace. But Brennan Johnson’s scrappy goal was hugely damaging for the club’s shaky finances and Amorim, who will now have a task convincing new recruits to join in the summer transfer window.",
      "United reacted by making it clear they would listen to offers for any of their underperforming squad, who have now jetted off to Malaysia for the first of two money-spinning post-season friendlies. But that wasn’t the first flight for Amorim, who travelled to Monaco on Friday to attend a high-profile meeting with the club’s owners and executives.",
      "The meeting takes place every month in INEOS’ spiritual home, but doesn’t normally involve the manager, The Athletic reports. Amorim left having received backing from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the other club bigwigs, but he is under increasing pressure to deliver following a miserable start which has seen him win just 16 of his 42 games in charge.",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final defeat, but before he flew to Monaco, Amorim offered to walk away without compensation. “I have nothing to show to the fans, so at this moment it's a little bit of faith,” said Amorim.",
      "“So let’s see. I'm always open. If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day, without any conversation about compensation. But I will not quit. I'm still really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change anything in the way I do things. I am always really honest.”",
      "He sounded a different note on the Old Trafford pitch, when addressing supporters following the Villa win. “First of all, I want to apologise,” he said. “It was really disappointing with the team. Secondly, I want to say thank you.",
      "\"We are very grateful for your support during the season. I know it was really hard to support us in many games. But now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. Because this season is in the past, it's over.",
      "\"We fight each other or we stick together and move forward. Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you a storm is coming. Today, after this disaster season, I want to tell you the good days are coming.”",
      "United are planning to be busy in the summer transfer window, with the £62.5million arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves the first of what the club hopes will be many signings. The club are also in the running to sign Ipswich striker Liam Delap, but Amorim knows he only has around £100m to play with and that sales are therefore key.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are the top priorities when it comes to exits, while Alejandro Garnacho has been told he is not part of Amorim’s plans. He is being targeted by Napoli, while there is also interest from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in captain Bruno Fernandes.",

Only six players scored more in Italy's top flight this term, and needless to say, that contribution could have been used by a United team that just set a new record low for goals scored in a Premier League season (44).",
      "Not bad for a £25.7million investment deemed surplus to requirements by his boyhood club. Ferguson's admiration of the player is well documented, and it was during the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that the United great made it clear he felt McTominay deserved to be a prominent part of the XI.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "That testimony to the player's moral fibre describes exactly the profile of player Amorim could have used more this season. Too often did United take the lead in games this season, only to welcome pressure upon themselves, while their 18 defeats are the most they've recorded in a league campaign in more than half a century.",
      "To Ten Hag's credit, the Dutchman said in October that he \"didn't want\" to see McTominay leave in a decision that was more so pushed by the club. McTominay appeared to confirm as much in December when he told the BBC Football Daily podcast Financial Fair Play (FFP) was a factor.",
      "Much of United's transfer travails in the post-Ferguson era come down to prioritising the wrong profile of player. The club has spent vast sums bringing in big names or expensive prospects who often don't fit the bill in their positions, frequently overlooking certain intangibles that McTominay possesses.",
      "\"I signed [McTominay] when he was seven or eight years of age and he was actually a centre-forward as a kid,\" added Ferguson in 2021. \"He's just sprouted, a little bit like Darren Fletcher. Darren had a few little annoying injuries as he was growing and needed some rest periods and things like that.",
      "\"McTominay is of a similar type to Darren - long, lanky, good winner of the ball and a good turn of pace going forward, a great attitude to the game. All these attitudes that Darren Fletcher had, he's got them.\"",
      "Ferguson, 83, developed a knack for recruiting somewhat under-the-radar talents who made his teams greater than the sum of their parts. And these players often had a hand in making the glossier names on the team sheet shine, with Park Ji-sung, Nemanja Vidic and John O'Shea perhaps among the best examples.",
      "The £25m or so United received for McTominay's signature may look like a pittance now, considering what he has achieved in Italy. It's fair to say the Red Devils' loss was Napoli's gain as he took to Italian football with ease, displaying the kind of all-action midfield presence that was plain to see in his last season at Old Trafford."

      "Ruben Amorim reduced his Sporting CP squad to tears when he left the club in November to take the reins of Manchester United. The Portuguese tactician enjoyed a stellar four-year stint with the Primeira Liga side between 2020 and 2024, winning three league titles and three domestic cups before the Red Devils spent £11million to bring him and his coaching staff to Old Trafford.",
      "And while Amorim has had a far-from-stellar season with United, winning just eight Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag and finishing a record low 15th in the standings, it is clear that the 40-year-old is able to build budding relationships with his players.",
      "That is, of course, if his former Sporting CP squad's opinions of him are anything to go off. As per Abola, Eduardo Quaresma broke down in tears in the wake of Amorim leaving the club last year, telling the publication: \"I was sad, we had a very good relationship with the manager, I feel sad for him, he deserves everything good.",
      "\"I don't believe it. There were times when I didn't believe it would happen. I don't know if I can say it. We had a meeting and he said to us, 'Guys, I don't know anything, trust me.'",
      "\"The next game, the guy said he was leaving, but he stayed for another four games. All I could think was, 'Go away'. I cried a lot. I think I cried the most.\"",
      "Quaresma was not the only player who was emotional as Amorim parted ways with the European stalwarts either, with Pedro Goncalves also noting an incredibly strong relationship with his former manager. The attacking midfielder said: \"I wouldn't be here today [without him].",
      "\"We had a very strong bond, both professionally and personally. He liked my wife very much and was concerned about my well-being, both on the field and in my family life.",
      "\"He knew when players were happy or sad, and he knew exactly what to say. We were sad. I started crying because I really liked him, and I was sad. I never told him not to go; I wished him good luck. The players understood. He was like a father to us. We were sad, but we understood. I wish him the best of luck.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Maximiliano Araujo, who was brought to the Jose Alvalade by Amorim last summer, highlighted the impact that the manager had on not only him, but the squad as a whole. He revealed to Abola his disappointment in seeing Amorim leave for United: \"It was normal.",
      "\"I noticed it, yes, in many of my team-mates, because it was normal. That's what I'm telling you. When you have a really good coach like that, you don't want him to leave. When so many players cry... I have no doubt that many players felt a lot of affection for him. And, yes, it was a bit difficult. As I say... it was normal, understandable, given all the affection the players felt for him.\"",
      "After Amorim's exit from Sporting CP, Joao Pereira took the reins of the club for a month before he was replaced by Rui Borges in December.",
      "And the 43-year-old not only managed to guide his team to a Taca de Portugal trophy, but also to beat rivals Benfica to a Liga Portugal title by two points. It comes as Amorim held his hands up for a lacklustre first season at Old Trafford, as he has failed to get his inherited squad to adapt to his patented style of play.",
      "While the manager was able to oversee a 2-0 win over Aston Villa during Sunday's seasonal finale at Old Trafford - courtesy of goals from Amad and Christian Eriksen - the victory came as all but a consolation prize from an otherwise dreadful term. Addressing fans from the pitch after the full-time whistle, Amorim said: \"First of all, I want to apologise for this season.",
      "\"I know you are really disappointed with me, and really disappointed with the team. Second thing, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, and I know that was really hard.",
      "\"I know it was really hard in many ways, but now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past. It's over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge with two victories and one draw, I said to you, 'The storm is coming.' Today, after this disaster season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming. If there is one club in the world that proved in the past, that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"Now I want to say sorry also to my players. Sometimes I was not fair, but I tried always to be honest to you guys. Thank you very much, see you next season.\"",

      "Amid a lack of European football next season, United will not need to manage a squad as big as they have this season, meaning they are unlikely to require the same number of incomings as outgoings.",
      "Nevertheless, there is no doubt that head coach Ruben Amorim needs to add fresh blood and injections of quality, particularly in attacking areas. United struggled for goals domestically this season and desperately need to improve their attacking output ahead of next term.",
      "It is looking increasingly likely that Wolves ace Matheus Cunha will be drafted in as the club's first signing of the summer. The Brazilian has been identified to fill one of the two playmaker positions and United are expected to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Having played as a No.10 at Molineux, the former Atletico Madrid man is a suitable fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. The United boss wants an increased attacking presence buzzing around the central striker and Cunha fits the mould.",
      "As for bolstering the No.9 position, United have also made good progress with their identification process, long since pinpointing Ipswich Town's Liam Delap as an option.",

      "Available for £30m via a release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's relegation, Delap is no stranger to United technical director Jason Wilcox from the time they spent together at City. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna confirmed last Friday that Delap is increasingly likely to leave Portman Road this summer.",
      "Already planning to spend north of £90m on two Premier League-ready players to strengthen their attack, United have also been credited with interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo by multiple outlets in the last day or so. The Cameroonian has enjoyed an excellent season for the Bees, scoring 20 Premier League goals.",
      "The jewel in Brentford's crown, Mbeumo, who was signed from French club Troyes in 2019, was only outscored in the Premier League this season by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22). He also registered seven assists.",
      "Capable of playing from the right wing or up front, Mbeumo is a suitable fit to operate close to Delap in the right-sided No.10 position. He also has the athleticism United so desperately need to add in this summer's window.",
      "Reportedly valued at around £50m, there is no doubt United will have to maximise the seller's market to go after Mbeumo's signature.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo, Cunha and Delap all being signed in one window is an ambitious thought. However, it is not beyond the realms of possibility if United manage to offload the likes of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony.",
      "United need to strengthen other areas beyond their attack, such as the centre of midfield, but bolstering their forward line is poised to take initial priority this summer. The club can ill-afford to be as limited up front again next term.",
      "Should Mbeumo, Delap and Cunha be signed this summer, they should form United's strongest attack, forcing Bruno Fernandes into a more reserved role and Amad the right wing-back berth. The aforementioned duo are two players the Reds must retain this summer amid their increased importance.",
      "There is also a case for United to strengthen in goal and possibly at wing-back. For now, though, bolstering the attack has to take priority.",
      "United's strongest line-up with three new signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Delap."

      "However, head coach Ruben Amorim has warned the club \"cannot do much\" amid their failure to secure Champions League qualification for next season.",
      "Qualification for Europe's premier club competition would have significantly boosted United's coffers, giving them an increased chance of signing Amorim's top targets. Instead, they will have to be shrewd and sales will be much more important.",
      "United plan to offload Alejandro Garnacho after Amorim informed that he can leave at the right price, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been earmarked as figures United want to sell as a priority. The Reds have also made it clear to the players who are under contract for next season that nobody is immune from being sold this summer.",
      "But with Amorim having warned that a hive of activity is unlikely, certainly in terms of a mass turnover, it is guaranteed that some players many United supporters would be in favour of being offloaded this summer will still be in situ come the start of next season.",

      "Should United successfully get a deal over the line, he is likely to occupy the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Bruno Fernandes could be tasked with dropping deeper and operating from midfield. He has demonstrated several times throughout his United career that he can pull the strings from a reserved role.",
      "United have also been linked with bringing in one of this season's leading lights in the Premier League in the form of Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star scored 20 goals this term and reports elsewhere have linked United with a £50m swoop for the Cameroon international.",
      "If United were able to lure him to M16, it would mark a serious statement of intent. He is an excellent player and has established himself as a reliable source of goals at this level.",

      "Delap is available via a £30m release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's immediate return to the Championship. He scored a respectable 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "Bolstering the attacking department is set to be United's first port of call this summer, but additions in other areas will be required to fine-tune the squad ahead of next season.

      "One of them, Florian Wirtz, is being tipped to collect a fee well in excess of €100m (£85m), which would give Ten Hag a healthy budget to use on his new squad, while Jeremie Frimpong is expected to fetch £30m from Liverpool.",
      "The most obvious shouts would be members of his former Ajax cohort who followed to Old Trafford. First and foremost is Antony, who has been revitalised on loan at Real Betis and faces an uncertain future once he returns, could make an interesting replacement for Wirtz.",
      "There is a report from BILD stating that a new playmaker will be on the agenda if the 22-year-old moves to Anfield, and whilst Antony is not a direct substitution, he has the skillset.",
      "If he is looking for a No.10, Christian Eriksen is now confirmed to be leaving as his contract ends, so wouldn't get United a fee as Antony would but could move to Germany for free.",
      "A goalkeeper is also said to be required at the BayArena, so perhaps Ten Hag could once again seek out the services of Andre Onana, who has failed to impress this season. Altay Bayindir is an alternative option.",
      "With two central defenders also said to be sought after, Victor Lindelof is another player who could complete a free transfer now that his time in England is coming to an end after eight years.",
      "Finally, BILD's report comments on the expectation of Victor Boniface being sold, therefore Leverkusen would need a new striker. Both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee face extreme uncertainty this summer should Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap both be signed, so could offer Ten Hag and United a surefire solution to their respective conundrums.",
      "Three more suggestions can be made, starting with Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine winger has been told he can leave the club by Amorim. As Ten Hag brought him through into the senior team, their bond could prove strong once again in a new environment.",
      "Finally both Leverkusen full-backs are linked with moves away - Jeremie Frimpong seemingly all-but confirmed to be another Liverpool signing whilst speculation grows over Alex Grimaldo.",
      "United have Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot who Amorim has so far used but sees alternative signings, like Patrick Dorgu, as the way forward."

      "It was a season to forget for Manchester United with the club knowing that there will be no European football played at Old Trafford in the 2025/26 season.",
      "A 15th place finish in the Premier League and a 1-0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final last week means that there will be a rebuild at Old Trafford. A lot of that will happen in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim came into the club at the end of last year, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag. But he was unable to turn the season around. Addressing supporters following the final game of the season - a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, the United boss promised that “the good days are coming.”",
      "“We have to make a choice, or we stay stuck in the past because this season is in the past; it's over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward,” he said.",
      "\"Six months ago, after my first three games in charge with two victories and one draw, I said to you, 'the storm is coming'. Today, after this disastrous season, I want to tell you the good days are coming.",
      "\"If there is one club in the world that has proven in the past that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it is our club. It is Manchester United Football Club”",
      "As eyes turn to next season, a lot of work will be needed in the transfer window for what the club hopes will be a more successful campaign.",
      "Here’s our look at just some of the things we think should happen over the next few weeks and months.",
      "United look to be closing in on their first signing of the summer, just days after the end of the season. An agreement is said to have been reached with Matheus Cunha, which will see United pay his £62.5 million release clause to Wolves.",
      "The player is reported to have agreed a five year contract at Old Trafford with the option of another year, with the final details of the transfer being ironed out.",
      "Cunha has been one of the standout players in the Premier League this season, despite Wolves’ struggles before the arrival of manager Victor Pereira. The 26-year-old scored 15 times in 33 Premier League appearances in the season just gone.",
      "Given United’s need for attacking players in the summer, he will add quality in the forward areas at Old Trafford. Getting the deal done early will also show a good statement of intent by United.",
      "Another attacking player who has impressed in a struggling team this season. There is a lot of competition for the signature of Ipswich Town striker Delap, with the player having a £30 million relegation release clause in his contract.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 12 times in 37 appearances in his first full season in the Premier League. Given his age, he has shown huge potential to be able to make the step up to the next level.",
      "Given the struggles and the uncertainty of the future of both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, a new recognised striker should be one of the priorities for United in the summer.",
      "Delap has already proven that he can score in the Premier League. For £30 million he could prove to be a bargain.",
      "As well as incomings, it’s expected to be a busy transfer window for United in terms of outgoings too. It has already been confirmed that Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and Cristian Eriksen will all leave the club at the end of their contracts in the summer.",
      "They will be joined by other players who will move on. The three most obvious candidates to raise funds are Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho",
      "All have spent time away from the club on loan this season, and are not expected to be reintegrated into the squad upon their return.",
      "United have put a price of £40 million on Rashford, while Antony will be available for around £32.5 million.",
      "Chelsea have an obligation to make Sancho’s move permanent for £25 million, but look set to pay a penalty fee of £5 million to send him back to Old Trafford. United would then be on the lookout for another buyer.",
      "Two more players who United could look to sell are Alejandro Garnacho and Hojlund. There has been talk over the future of the former since January, with him hinting that he didn’t know what the future held following the Europa League defeat.",
      "Hojlund has struggled to make an impact at United since his move. The arrival of a new striker such as Delap is likely to push him down the pecking order.",
      "United could look to cash in on the Danish international to raise funds for more incomings."

      "After being the subject of interest and back and forth negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain for much of last summer, United got a deal over the line for the midfielder on the final day of the transfer window.",
      "United were desperate to add a defensive presence to their midfield amid Casemiro's sharp decline in 2023/24 and Ugarte was drafted in for an initial fee of £42.3million, with a further £8.5m to be paid in add-ons.",
      "Ugarte was drafted in with the expectation of providing a much-needed defensive presence. United's midfield often went missing last season, with huge gaps being exposed on countless occasions.",
      "Ugarte was an attainable option after not being deemed of having a long-term future in the French capital. On paper, it looked like a smart addition from United's point of view.",
      "However, there was huge pressure on his shoulders to deliver the goods from the start. United needed somebody to marshal their midfield and provide some steel and grit.",
      "However, before he had even made his debut for United, legendary midfielder Paul Scholes expressed concerns that Ugarte would not be able to single-handedly fix United's midfield woes.",
      "\"He's going to have to be some player,\" said Scholes, speaking last September. \"I think he will play the position well, he's still 23, he's had a few clubs which slightly concerns you.",
      "\"But he does play the position well. I don't think he'll vacate that area as much as we've seen, a bit more discipline, he'll plug the gaps I hope, that's going to be his role.",
      "\"I don't think he's going to be the greatest of playmakers – I don't think you're looking at a Toni Kroos. [Erik ten Hag] needs discipline in there, he's obviously seen that already. Casemiro, okay, not great legs. I don't think [Kobbie] Mainoo as an athlete is that great. He relies more on his manipulation of the ball and his quality on the ball.",
      "\"Ugarte has got to be everything. He's going to have to be some player to make this team better, it's a big job on his hands and I just can't see it.\"",
      "Ugarte, who was not Ten Hag's first-choice option to fix United's midfield last summer, has provided United with a defensive presence this season, with his best run of form arguably coming in January, with his performances away to Liverpool and Arsenal particularly impressive.",
      "However, the increased pace of the Premier League in comparison to what he had previously been used to has hindered him. He was caught out for West Ham United's second goal at Old Trafford earlier this month, being dispossessed when trying to turn with the ball, and that pinpointed a flaw in his game.",
      "The Uruguayan does not have the same amount of time to dictate proceedings as he did in France and Portugal, meaning concerns have been raised about his suitability as a starter for United. The Reds, once more, could find themselves on the hunt for a midfielder this summer that can take the ball on the half turn and progress the play, while at the same time offering a defensive presence.",
      "Expected to excel after being reunited with Ruben Amorim, his absence from United's starting XI for their final three games of the season felt telling, particularly for the Europa League final last week.",
      "By no means should United give up on Ugarte yet, but he has not been as perfect as they would have hoped for, meaning Scholes' concerns have been vindicated. However, they may feel the need to buy an upgrade this summer."

      "\"However, the problem Amorim has with Alejandro Garnacho would likely reappear with Leao. The Milan star is a natural wide man who likes to cut inside and cause damage, rather than a player like Mbeumo who will take up positions centrally and out wide.",
      "\"He’s a headline name would be a pull for some supporters but it would go against what United need to do this window and that's to give Amorim the players which suit his formation. Leao should be swerved.\""

      "United are keen to strengthen their attacking options in the upcoming transfer window, with Delap seen as a key target. The club are reportedly closing in on a £62.5 million deal for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha as they look to back Ruben Amorim after a disappointing Premier League campaign.",

      "It is said that a key consideration for the player is a guarantee of regular playing time in hopes of catching the eye of England manager Thomas Tuchel ahead of next summer’s World Cup.",
      "The lack of European football on offer at United may be a stumbling block, but it is added that the club feel that their pitch to Delap is ‘strong’, and the Manchester City academy graduate's desire to return to the north west could be a factor.",

      "“Do I think a loan move would help him? No – I think what’s best for him as a young man is moving somewhere else permanently. Everything seems to be too much for him and I think he’s in the mindset where he’s letting everyone down, which is a horrible place to be in.",

I question whether the club has the power to go out and sign someone like Alexander Isak? I don’t think they have the ability to pull in some of the best players in the world anymore, and that is a problem.",

I look at clubs like Fulham and Brighton and their identity remains the same regardless of the system – high tempo, brave on the ball, running without the ball.",

    "body": [
      "We had a lovely Bank Holiday afternoon poring over the F365 tables now 2024-25 is in the bag. Don’t pretend you were having more fun with your family and friends…",
      "After all, we’ve got 21 different tables, and within those, plenty of nifty filtering options and all sorts of other user-friendly features. You just don’t get that in the pub or out in the fresh air.",
      "So here are 16 Conclusions drawn from those very tables…",
      "1) Let’s start with the one that really matters: the actual league table. In short: Liverpool are the best team in the country; Arsenal are Arsenal; Nottingham Forest caught us all out; Manchester United and Tottenham are each a genuine disgrace; and the gap between the Premier League and the Championship, evidently, is getting bigger. Need we go on? Well, yes, apparently we do…",
      "",
      "2) Why are Liverpool the best team in the country? The ridiculousness of Mo Salah has something to do with it, and the Egyptian will be a largely responsible for their collective creative genius. The Reds have scored 66 of their 86 goals from open play, 16 more than third-placed Arsenal in that metric. Liverpool have topped the big chances created table for the last five years now, but not like this. Having created 112 big chances, they are 19 clear of second-placed Chelsea, who might have felt like telling their critics to ‘eff off’ but perhaps their passage into the Champions League might have been more serene had they not been so wasteful.",
      "3) Nottingham Forest, in sharp contrast, have been razor sharp in front of goal. Only West Ham and the three relegated teams created fewer big chances than Forest (58). They outperformed their xG by five goals (4.85 actually, but…) which is creditable. But, sustainable?",
      "",
      "4) Forest faded, but Manchester United and Tottenham unashamedly downed tools in the Premier League once they realised their best chance of rescuing a wretched season lay in Europe. The form table leaves Spurs second-bottom over the last six games. The only reason they aren’t bottom is because they scored one goal more than Ipswich in that time. If we go back even further, over a 10-game period, they’re still second-bottom.",
      "Still, Ange Postecoglou’s gamble paid off and Spurs fans right now aren’t likely to give a shiny sh*te while they bask in Europa League glory. Especially while they can reasonably claim to have had a better season than Arsenal despite being hilariously crap for the last quarter of it.",
      "",
      "5) Spurs and United weren’t rubbish for a lack of the ball. In terms of possession, they are fifth and sixth respectively. So what the f*** were they doing with it? In United’s case, nothing much. Only Everton and three relegated sides scored fewer from open play, while 11 teams created more big chances. Further proving that possession means nothing, Forest are Europe-bound despite having had the ball less than anyone bar Everton and Ipswich.",
      "",
      "6) If Ruben Amorim wants an easy way of improving United, he might simply tell his players they kick off an hour before they actually do. Because if matches ended at half-time, they would have been relegated.",
      "",
      "7) Similarly, thanks to the table that allows us to break matches into 15-minute intervals, it is possible to pinpoint the particular period where Spurs go full Spurs. They start well. Only Forest are better through the opening quarter of an hour. And from 16-30 minutes, they’re seventh. Then they remember they are Tottenham and plummet to 18th between the half-hour and 45-minute mark.",
      "",
      "8) Fulham have been unfathomably fun. No team is more reliable for your both teams to score acca, and the Cottagers have pissed on the chips of their top-half opponents to such an extent that only Liverpool have taken more than the 30 points amassed by Marco Silva’s side. What makes them such a head f***, though, is the fact that only the relegated sides have a worse record against bottom-half sides.",
      "",
      "9) Everton are also proper weird. Away from home against top-half opposition, they won 17 points and in that respect there isn’t a better team in the Premier League. But on the road against bottom-half teams, only Southampton have taken fewer than the Toffees’ seven points.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Winners: Liverpool, Salah, Newcastle, Forest, Chelsea, Moyes and more",
      "",
      "10) If Mikel Arteta is looking for reasons why Arsenal were Arsenal, the most obvious one is they drew too many games – 14. Only once in the Premier League era have they drawn more matches and that was in a 42-game season. They suffered the same number of defeats as runaway champions Liverpool, but too often failed to turn one point into three, resulting in a 10-point deficit, even after Liverpool swapped boots for flip-flops upon sealing the title a month ago. Fair play to the Reds for highlighting their dominance by chucking in the last month, during which time only Wolves, Ipswich, Southampton and – obviously – Spurs have taken fewer points.",
      "",
      "11) Back to Arsenal: for a team with title ambitions, their home form has been sketchy (fifth-best in the league) but on the road against top-half opposition, they’ve won only once and taken the same number of points as Man Utd. Which, as we know, is the polar opposite of title-winning form.",
      "",
      "12) Changing managers doesn’t always have the desired effect. Just ask Man Utd. But sometimes it definitely does. Everton dismissed Sean Dyche in January while languishing in 16th. In the table since David Moyes returned, the Toffees are eighth.",
      "Similarly, Wolves were second-bottom with nine points – 0.6 ppg – when Gary O’Neil was given the elbow in mid-December. Since Vitor Pereira came in, that table has them 12th with 1.5 ppg.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Losers: United, City, Arsenal, relegation farce and more",
      "",
      "13) Don’t turn your backs on Bournemouth when the clock ticks over to 90. The Cherries have scored 10 goals in added time during their record-breaking season, including a couple at Everton in August to turn a deficit on 90 to a victory at full-time.",
      "THE greatest comeback in @premierleague history 🍿 pic.twitter.com/emI7nZ0y1x",
      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) August 31, 2024",
      "14) No one needs telling that trailing to Tottenham usually means nothing. But don’t go ahead against Brighton and think it’s job done – those Seagulls will still nick your chips and unload on you as they go.",
      "15) Pep Guardiola, much like Sir Alex Ferguson, likes his teams to put their foot down come January. But Manchester City coughed and spluttered so much through the first half of the season, the Premier League’s best record in 2025 was unable to save their season.",
      "",
      "16) Tables are fun, aren’t they?",
      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "Oliver Glasner got into the mind of Pep Guardiola to end the major trophy drought of Crystal Palace and make a fair few people look foolish in the process.",
      "Chelsea playmaker Cole Palmer ended his long goal drought, and deservedly so. This was his game, everyone else including Liverpool was just living in it.",
      "Liverpool wrapped up their long-inevitable Premier League title success as they entirely overwhelmed a predictably hapless and hopeless Spurs.",
      "It was not a classic between Manchester United and Man City but Bruno Fernandes tried his best and Pep Guardiola kept things interesting after the game.",
      "Declan Rice rescued Arsenal twice and then absolutely nailed them after their draw with Manchester United. But Gary Neville is not bothered about all that."

      "",
      "Whistle blower\nAlright then. A few thoughts on the Man Utd/Villa controversy. I’ve caught up now having been out playing cricket and reading/hearing about what was happening from the BBC live feed, fielders, mates on WhatsApp. Whilst umpiring. Good job there were no vociferous LBW appeals.",
      "Law 12 states a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when: ‘The ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save’…",
      "What an earth does the second half of that sentence mean. ‘by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds…’ Genuinely, can anyone explain that to me? If that ball is in contact with the back of a keepers hand they’re deemed in control? If it’s touching the elbow? Why do they makes the laws so ambiguous? I wouldn’t expect my keeper to get away with Bayindir’s error, so (along with seemingly the majority of others) thought the goal should have stood. However…",
      "That, alone, has not cost Villa a CL spot. In fairness as well, I’m not sure McGinn or Emery claimed afterwards that it did. The complaint to the PGMOL seems a little churlish, but it is only a ‘complaint’. Or, if viewed differently, a suggestion of how to improve things.",
      "Villa are not asking for anything specific in regards to that inicident. In the 90 minutes against a poor Man Utd team Villa were awful. They froze when in mattered most. (Palace and Olympiacos anyone?). Martinez’s madness is a fitting way for him to end his Villa tenure. What on earth was he thinking? Hojlund had so much to do still. Hojlund!",
      "Villa have missed out on goal difference having drawn twice with Ipswich and conceded late late goals far too often (Bournemouth at home, City away, Forest away… I could go on). There are plenty of moments over 38 games where Villa could have done better. The thing is though, both things can coexist. I.e. that decision could have cost us CL football whilst, at the same time, Villa didn’t turn up and should take a look at their own performance in that game and over the season.",
      "Anyhoo, three years in a row in Europe ain’t too shabby. I would imagine Villa will be amongst the favourites in the Europa League as well. What’s that Unai? Oh, you have, have you?\nGary AVFC, Oxford (Never a dull moment with Emi!)",
      "MORE: Emery ‘owes the referee a drink’ for screwing Aston Villa as ‘man child’ ruins Villans legacy",
      "",
      "The VAR debate rages on\nSo with due deference to Villa fans who will doubtless still be traumatised, I don’t think the refereeing f*ckup was that bad.  Bayındır was clearly very very close to having both hands on the ball, and there’s so few “player kicks the ball out of the keeper’s hands” incidents that I’m not sure how the ref is supposed to be able to tell whether it’s a foul or a fumble if they’re even slightly unsighted.",
      "I do completely understand Villa’s point about having a very new-to-the-PL ref who hasn’t got much experience of VAR when two experienced refs are assigned to the meaningless Liverpool and Arsenal games – a more experienced ref might have held on two seconds before blowing.",
      "The issue is VAR’s ironclad rules about what it can’t be involved in, particularly the absolute cut off when the whistle goes again.  Going back to the Liverpool Spurs fuckup, surely everyone would be okay with Spurs kicking off, the VAR officials screaming in their ear they should have awarded a goal, the ref blowing dead and giving the goal?",
      "We’ve seen a ton of really dodgy decisions this year where the ref has given a yellow and suddenly VAR is entirely excluded.  There’s also the daftness where once VAR is looking at an incident, it can only give pens, reds or no foul.  Surely once you’ve got VAR involved they should be allowed to give the correct decision, rather than “whoops, not my department”.",
      "I realise more VAR is probably not what anyone else wants, and I realise there is a safety aspect to making sure everything stops when the ref blows up, but surely there could be some flex here?  I also realise there is a certain level of “can’t we just have some common sense”, but I think there’s some helpful flexibility available here.",
      "I feel for the refs having to ref the rest of a game knowing they’ve made obviously bad decisions and can’t correct it because the rules say it’s the wrong kind of mistake.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "What a VARce\nWell done VAR once again for interfering and screwing up and costing two clubs a fortune.",
      "Firstly, having enjoyed a full season without the Stockley Park idiots, we then have to welcome them for the Champo final at Wembley. Without VAR, the Blades second goal stands as the ref allowed the goal, and in all probability, we go up to the Premier League. But no. In steps VAR and overturns the decision (correctly) and we manage to screw it up by sitting back and allowing Sunderland to win the game. Cost to United – around £130m as an estimate.",
      "Then we get the farce at OT when VAR cannot step in because the schoolboy running the game blew his whistle before Villa scored. What is the point of having VAR if a clearly wrong decision cannot be rectified? If that goal stands, then the probability is that Villa either win or hold out for a draw. Cost to Villa – around £100m as an estimate.",
      "That’s two incredibly expensive decisions influenced (or not) by VAR. They should be made to re-imburse Villa and should be barred from all future play off finals where teams are used to not having the interfering prats doing all they can to rule out goals. Leave it to the ref and the lino’s.",
      "At first, pretty peeved that we didn’t make it 10th time lucky in the play-offs (lost the previous 9), but on reflection, I think we may have swerved another season of misery and frustration dealing with VAR decisions. Good luck to the Black Cats – they are going to need it – but I think I’d rather enjoy the game than put up with the VAR nonsense.",
      "Either scrap VAR or fix it, because at present what we cannot cure, we have to endure.\nBladey Mick (Happy days are here again)",
      "",
      "Sadly, VAR\nDear all,",
      "Another Premier League weekend, the last until August, but, sadly, VAR dominates a lot of the conversation. It even leaked into the Championship play off final and the decision to use it just for one game should be coming under a lot more scrutiny than it has so far.",
      "However, for those criticising individual decisions, and the whole VAR circus, no matter how justifiably, I would like to remind you that last summer, one Premier League club instigated a vote on whether the whole thing should be abandoned, at least until it could be overhauled and reformed, a proposal which was defeated by a margin of 19-1.",
      "In other words, if you support a Premier League club, and your team isn’t called Wolves, your club voted to retain the whole wretched procedure, ending up with some of the nonsense we’ve seen this past weekend. It is overwhelmingly tempting to use the phrase ‘We told you so’, so I will. You voted for it, this is the result.",

      "Newcastle broke their 50+ year drought in the Carabao Cup amid emotional scenes you’d have to have a heart of stone (or be a Mackem) not to have enjoyed. Palace win the first trophy in their long history, seeing off City in the FA Cup final. And to top it off Spurs broke their 17-year drought by clinching the Europa League in an all English final.",
      "We’ve also seen the rebirth of one of the most storied clubs – Forest – as a force at the top end of the table.",

      "He got a boo 2 weeks back for being perceived to have led on the clubs and fans. Klopp (decent man) came in and said his piece to admonish the fans, and Trent received the treatment he deserved (on the balance: minor boos for walking as a free agent; and extended laudatory applause At introduction and at end of game).",

      "But then it happened, the wood work shook, the incredible fans roared, and we somehow managed to get over the line for penalties, and then the nervousness left. You could tell from the expressions and body language that only one team was going to win it from that point forward.",

      "",
      "GK: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace)\nThere have been plenty of calls across the season for Manchester United to re-sign David De Gea, in a majestic combination of amnesia and arrogance given he was really quite terrible before he left the club and almost certainly wouldn’t want to leave his cushty gig for Conference League qualifiers Fiorentina to tend a goal barraged by opposition players behind a more deplorable United side than he had to endure in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "We accept that he probably wouldn’t have been as bad as Andre Onana, but Dean Henderson would have been a marked improvement. He made the most of his good fortune in the FA Cup final to play a huge hand in helping Crystal Palace to their first trophy and has been consistently excellent all season.",

      "And sure, they could absolutely do with that cash, but that’s a well-discovered silver lining of a transfer for a left-back-cum-centre-back that United have been crying out for all season whom they sold to the Portuguese side for just £5m a year ago.",

      "Amorim’s side have the perfect opportunity to put this season behind them last Wednesday as they faced Tottenham in the Europa League final but Man Utd lost 1-0 to a Brennan Johnson goal.",
      "There are rumours that a number of Amorim’s current squad will have to depart and Sutton has recommended that Man Utd “get rid” of six players.",
      "Combing through the whole squad, Sutton’s first pick to leave was Matthijs de Ligt, who Man Utd bought for £43m in 2024.",
      "READ: Gravenberch, Murphy, Caicedo: Top 10 most improved Premier League players this season",
      "Sutton told the Daily Mail: “If I had to choose between keeping him or Harry Maguire, it’s a no contest. De Ligt doesn’t bring what’s required to the back line.”",
      "Injury-prone Luke Shaw was next: “I’d biff him off now, not least because of his injury record. I like him as a player when fit, but it’s time to part ways.”",
      "Manuel Ugarte, who was another summer signing, also faces the chop in Sutton’s eyes, the former Premier League striker added: “Not impressed by him, not for a fee that could hit £51m. Could United recoup close to that? Well, that’s not my problem!”",
      "On Casemiro, Sutton continued: “His legs are shot. Yes, he’s got experience in abundance. But he cannot keep up in this system or at this level.”",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has scored just three Premier League goals all season and Sutton reckons they need to “get rid”: “United want to get to the top of the Premier League and into the Champions League. Is Zirkzee a player who gets you there? Not for me, he isn’t.”",
      "Similar to Zirkzee, Rasmus Hojlund’s goalscoring this season has been poor, Sutton said: “I don’t think he has that striker quality required for the Premier League. Hard worker but not the source of goals they desperately need.”",
      "But former Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea striker Sutton gave Man Utd boss Amorim the benefit of the doubt and reckons the Red Devils board should “keep” him.",
      "On Amorim, Sutton continued: “Ruben Amorim doesn’t adapt, and he says he never will. To make his time with United a success, he needs to be backed with players who suit his style.",

But to see people with a smile on their face and you go home and have a good feeling in the stadium, I think that’s hopefully something we’ll bring into next season and start well.”",
      "Eriksen went on to thank supporters for their backing during a tough campaign.",
      "“There’s been so many games this season where they [supporters] could have caused a lot of chaos where we’ve been disappointed with our football,” he said.",

Obviously, at home has been, even in the stadium, there’s been games where it’s been not good enough, but they’ve really been supportive and away especially they’ve been even more on their toes and even in the worst times.",

      "On what comes next, the 32-year-old added: “First of all there’s a bit of a holiday and national team. Then after that we’ll see where next season starts, but at the moment there’s nothing (lined up). There’s options.”",
      "He also reflected on Utd’s struggles this season and how close things came to going even worse.",
      "“I think unfortunately there’s been a lot of lows this season with the games, and obviously the final was the missing piece. It’s football,” he said.",
      "“For me now, I think people are lucky that we are where we are, not relegated with the team with the season we’ve had, so it is also a bit of luck you have to acknowledge. Next season it has to be better, and I’m sure it will be. I’m looking forward to watching it from the sides.”",
      "Finally, Eriksen expressed confidence in the players who remain, and in what new manager Ruben Amorim can bring.",
      "“I think you’ve seen progress – of course the results haven’t really shown that. 100 per cent they haven’t shown that,” he said.",
      "“I think the football we came from Ten Hag to this is obviously going to take time to adapt, and obviously it’s been far below the standard of the club and the players here.",
      "“I think the players individually are very, very good players, and they should never be where we are in the table. It’s up to them to turn it around but, yeah, I’m confident they’ll be a very different team next season, I’m sure.”",

Chelsea, despite being a joke. Liverpool, despite losing a manager.’",

      "The standout answer here, and perhaps ever, surely belongs to Will Ford for his deeply prophetic ‘Liverpool will struggle’, a line destined for infamy and only partially redeemed by the immediately following ‘Man Utd will be worse’. Tottenham in third also didn’t quite pan out.",
      "Dishonourable mentions too for Winterburn for having United in there, and Stead for having Tottenham.",

      "Three picks for relegation please.\nObvious answer is obvious, but plenty eschewed that obviousness so give Winterburn, Stead and a partially redeemed Ford their flowers for refusing to make this more complicated than it needed to be. ‘Sometimes you can try and be too clever’ were Winty’s words of wisdom when selecting the three who’d come up to go back down, and that was advice almost all of her charges went on to cheerfully ignore.",
      "A genuinely hilarious number of those too-clever idiots opted for Forest here, with Tickner, Watson and Oldham all stumbling into that particular trap along with Nicholson who declared ‘Predictability rules again’ as he did so. This season really has been a mad one.",
      "Still, even those who got it hilariously wrong did all manage to send at least two of the promoted clubs straight back down, and Soutar is surely grateful for the even wronger answers elsewhere that allow his punt on Brentford to slip by almost unnoticed.",

The highest position in which they ended any matchday this season was 15th after six games. ‘Everton will be in a similar spot as they enjoy a decent final year at Goodison’ is much more like it, with the Toffees 13th when the music stopped.",

      "Erling Haaland…will not. It’s going to be Mohamed Salah.",
      "Stunning.",
      "Partial credit to Tickner for identifying Alexander Isak as ‘each-way value’ behind Erling Haaland, with Oldham also giving Newcastle’s star man the shout.",
      "",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact?\nThe correct answer here was surely Nikola Milenkovic at Forest and if it’s not him then it may well in fact be Elliot Anderson also at Forest.",
      "Anyway. Nobody said those.",
      "Winterburn and Watson were both charmed by Niclas Fullkrug. Winty reckoned he would ‘buck the West Ham striker trend’ while Watson noted ‘West Ham with an actual striker should be useful’. He scored three Premier League goals. West Ham were not useful.",
      "Nicholson went for Matthijs De Ligt, which definitely isn’t the right answer and nor was Emile Smith Rowe (Ford), Riccardo Calafiori (Tickner) or Fabio Carvalho (Oldham).",
      "‘Amario Cozier-Duberry could shine if given adequate minutes by Brighton,’ piped up Soutar. Is 713 minutes for Blackburn adequate, we wonder.",
      "",
      "And which one will turn out to be a massive flop?\nLots of Matthijs de Ligt here and that’s probably just about fair enough. Also lots of Dominic Solanke, which is a trickier one.",
      "We’re particular fascinated here by Johnny Nic’s contribution here:",
      "Solanke’s nine goals will prove what we all suspect.",
      "Solanke duly scored precisely nine Premier League goals for Spurs. Yet we feel we’re absolutely none the wiser about him in general, and he was vital in the latter stages of that Europa League run. Perhaps it really is just as straightforward as noting that trying to understand Spurs is fundamentally impossible.",
      "Further proof of that in Tickner’s answer where Solanke’s unpredictability was tied to that of a Spurs team that could ‘finish third or ninth’ because the idea of ninth representing a peak Tottenham banter effort now just looks utterly adorable, doesn’t it?",
      "Easier wins come in this round for Ford and Oldham as they pick out Joshua Zirkzee, while Watto’s pick of another nine-goal striker in Iliman Ndiaye at Everton feels neither profoundly right nor embarrassingly wrong.",

      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain?\nNobody picked him out in the best signing category, but big points to Stead for selecting Milenkovic here.",
      "We’re assuming neither Winterburn nor Soutar were banking on Daichi Kamada having more Premier League red cards (1) than goal involvements (0), while another shout for Carvalho – Nicholson this time – has to go down as a swing and a miss.",
      "Oldham and Tickner’s admirable and noble attempts to manifest Ryan Sessegnon success kind of almost came off in the second half of the season, while Dave was also pretty much bang on with a very safe shout about £8m for Lucas Bergvall looking ‘stupidly cheap stupidly quickly’.",
      "Ford also right about £21m for Savinho, and also about why they were able to get him for £21m. Watto played the long game with Archie Gray and is almost certainly going to get the last laugh there even at £35m.",

      "Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year?\nStill technically TBC but absolutely nobody is getting this right because absolutely nobody said Mo Salah.",
      "There’s all manner of different flavour of wrong in here. You’re always a hostage to injury fortune here, of course, and that took out Winterburn (Rodri) and Stead (Saka) early doors.",
      "Interesting that this question prompted different – and wrong, cannot stress that enough – answers from all eight of our intrepid soothsayers, with De Ligt and Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice and Kevin De Bruyne and Cole Palmer all getting nods.",
      "In a grim round for all it’s probably Tickner who emerges with what tiny fragments of credit there are to be had for saying Isak. It’s still wrong, but it definitely feels the least wrong.",
      "",
      "First manager to leave their Premier League job?\nFrom least wrong to most wrong for Tickner here as he goes for Nottingham Forest hero Nuno Espirito Santo. Whoops.",
      "He is at least not alone in his shame, with Winterburn and Oldham making the same mistake.",
      "Steady’s Marco Silva punt isn’t much better, really, and nor is Soutar’s rush to judgement on Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton.",
      "Russell Martin (Nicholson) and Steve Cooper (Watson) are much better shouts because they at least didn’t make it to the new year. But they were pipped to the sack race crown by Erik Ten Hag, as correctly and in hindsight really bloody obviously called by Ford. He really would have done quite well here if it hadn’t been for that immortal ‘Liverpool will struggle’ effort.",
      "",
      "Pick the Champions League winner.\nSix shouts for Real Madrid and one for Bayern Munich after sacking Vincent Kompany means the only person even halfway in the running for any credit at all here is Ford again, who had PSG to beat Real Madrid in the final. If only he hadn’t got cocky by giving us the runner-up as well, he’d now be sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season.\nWinterburn was undeniably right – up to you whether it’s in the way she intended or not – with ‘Liverpool under anybody but Klopp’, while the wait goes on for Watson (‘Man City before a judge’) and Ford (‘One hundred and fifteen charges’).",
      "Tickner bloody loves format discourse and in fairness couldn’t possibly have known that ‘Sh*t Champions League format discourse’ would ultimately be overtaken by ‘Should Europa League winners really get a Champions League place if they are actually very sh*t discourse’.",
      "But that’s more than five words, anyway.",

      "Here are this season’s disgraces, and boy is there a lot of them.",
      "If you’re after something a bit more cheerful, the winners list is also available here.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nAnd we thought finishing 8th and winning the FA Cup last season was bad. Not sure if you’ve heard but this was their worst season in 50 years.",
      "The most remarkable thing about Manchester United at this point is just what a black hole for talent it is.  Players and managers can look very very good when they make the move, only for what was once Theatre of Dreams to become the place where careers go to sleep.",
      "Although there were some question marks, United’s summer recruitment looked good to most of us, yet they have collectively spent the whole season going backwards. The squad is full of players who made bright starts, but then got flattened out to the same level as everyone else.",
      "Remember when Kobbie Mainoo looked amazing? It was only last year. Remember being excited by Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho?",
      "Several players who have also apparently been deemed to be a big part of the problem at Old Trafford have left – whether by their own volition or because they have been exiled – and turned out to still be excellent: Antony, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay made our winners list for exactly that reason.",
      "Erik ten Hag still being in charge at the start of the season was also questionable, but he was replaced by one of European football’s hot young things in Ruben Amorim and things got worse, suggesting the Dutchman was not, in fact, the whole problem all along.",
      "United have thus become the kind of club whose precise issues are very difficult to pinpoint from the outside, other than to note there are lots of them.",
      "You could point at Liverpool two years ago and say ‘they need a new midfield’. You can point at Arsenal now and say ‘they need more quality in the final third’. For Tottenham, ‘they need more experience in the side’. For Manchester City, the opposite. Try to point at the issues at Manchester United, and you’ll run out of fingers.",
      "We’ve watched a lot of League One this season, and on more than one occasion have seen sides who just don’t look like they would score if they played until midnight. When that has happened, we find ourselves thinking ‘god, this is like watching Manchester United’ – and we’re genuinely not even trying to amuse ourselves with the comparison.",
      "This year there was no trophy at the end of it to act as any mitigation, and their showing in the Europa League final was pretty representative of how they’ve been. Throwing Harry Maguire up front to look for a goal may have worked in spectacular fashion to get them there in the first place, but it is not a strategy any serious club should be reliant on. But that’s what will happen when you have a side that looks so confused, so lacking in confidence and creativity.",
      "Even for those of us who grew up with the envious antipathy towards United that is afforded to all the best sides, it’s managed to go out the other side of being funny and is now actually quite sad.",
      "United are currently English football’s cautionary tale about how low a club can be brought if their priorities slip away into all the wrong place over time, regardless how big and rich they may be. It says a lot that even now, Amorim’s prospects are being questioned, rather than his head being stuck on a pike.",
      "It’s bad. They’re bad. And it feels like nothing other than a wholesale revolution in the way they do things is going to be enough to get them back on course.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana\nLong before you found yourself without spare fingers, though, you’d be extending one towards one player. Even within that absolute horror show, the goalkeeper has stood out as a particular liability. As spectacular as he can be at times, he’s just way too error-prone to be regarded as a top goalkeeper.",
      "Unfortunately for United, Altay Bayindir looks to be pretty much exactly the same – which we presume is the only reason Onana has been dropped and then restored and then dropped and then restored. But United can find better, and need to in the summer.",
      "",
      "Manchester City and Pep Guardiola\nYes, they’re in the losers list despite completing the famously mammoth task of winning the Community Shield. Sorry, Pep.",
      "Has death by rondo had its day? Are we now back in an age of swift, incisive, direct counter-attacking football? It’s too early to write that obituary just yet, especially after City got their act together sufficiently enough to finish third. But this season nonetheless marked the first time that Guardiola’s style has come in for really serious scrutiny beyond the aesthetic.",
      "The issues that contributed to City’s decline in the first two-thirds of the season had not gone unremarked upon beforehand. Erling Haaland looked mortal at times last season, too, while players like Kyle Walker and Kevin de Bruyne were self-evidently past their best.",
      "Still, nobody expected just how bad it was going to get. At one point in November-December, City managed one win and six points from 11 games across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "For the time being, we’re fairly content to say this could prove to be a difficult and disappointing transitional year for City, and it could have been a lot worse than finishing third despite all those issues.",
      "But even after rallying in January, thanks in part to some big spending in the transfer window, City were hammered by Arsenal and Real Madrid, beaten at home by Liverpool, lost what could have ended up being a crucial six-pointer against Nottingham Forest, dropped points to Manchester United and Southampton, and lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace.",
      "That suggests there is still more work to be done to get back to business as normal for a club that has a genuine and well-founded expectation that they’re capable of winning everything in sight.",
      "",
      "Phil Foden and, for completely opposite reasons, Jack Grealish\nWe have sympathy for both. Poor Foden spoke this week about simply being physically and mentally burnt out, to which the only appropriate response is ‘yeah, no s*** Phil, you bloody look it and all’.",
      "Over the past five years, Foden has played 286 competitive games of football for club and country, starting most of them; that’s an average of 57.2 a year, and for a side that has built its success on relentless pressure and intensity.",
      "Genuinely, it’s impressive that it took this long for Foden to have an off season. We say this without any shade intended towards the Chelsea man, but Cole Palmer took less than half as long for it to catch up to him.",
      "It does raise an interesting talking point, and before you write in, we’re not specifically ragging on Guardiola alone here: he’s far, far from the only manager to do this kind of thing.",
      "But while we agree with complaints from the likes of Guardiola about fixture congestion and the demands simply being too much, we can never quite understand why more managers don’t recognise that they have the ability to give their players a month off as and when they need it for their own longer-term good.",
      "All the while, there sits Jack Grealish, desperate to play and supremely talented, but largely left to twiddle his thumbs. You could say that when he’s played he’s not been amazing, but since the turn of the new year he’s had all of 144 Premier League minutes across seven appearances. 90 of them were against Leicester, and he scored in that game.",
      "And yet Guardiola actually wants a smaller squad next season, saying he would quit if he had such a large squad again next season because trying to manage so many players is borderline impossible. Our trophy cabinet is far smaller than Guardiola’s (Cub Scout of the Year 1997/98, you’ll never sing that), but…doesn’t it feel obvious that Foden and Grealish have entirely opposite and complementary problems that can both be solved at once?",
      "Like we say, it’s not just Guardiola by any means – we’re just using this as an example. And yes, FIFA, UEFA and the federations have a responsibility. But surely clubs and managers do too?",
      "",
      "Arsenal and Mikel Arteta\nThey have to go in losers, we’re afraid, because Arsenal were more or less the default prediction for who was going to win the league this year, and quite justifiably so.",
      "The Gunners had pushed a very very good Manchester City side close over the past two seasons, and had a side that were just coming of age as City’s was beginning to look in need of a refresh. Yet all that optimism turned out to be misplaced.",
      "For our money, Arsenal fell way short of Liverpool this season for two main reasons. In the first half of the season, their lack of discipline was appalling – and by that we don’t mean they had too many bookings and red cards, which was merely a symptom of a wider issue.",
      "What we mean is that they were much too quick to lose their heads, whether that was because of refereeing decisions they didn’t like (regardless how correct they actually may have been) or because of the scoreboard.",
      "To Arteta’s credit, he seemed to manage to sort that out…only to run into problem number two.",
      "We’ve never quite gone all the way along with the ‘they need a striker’ thing, in truth. Arsenal scored 88 and 91 goals respectively in the past two seasons, despite their centre-forward options not being deemed to be up to snuff. Liverpool won the league this season with Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez, and an out-of-position Luis Diaz as their main striking options. Other players are allowed to score goals as well, lads.",
      "Where Arsenal have suffered is in a lack of depth in the forward line as a whole. That already felt like an issue even before injuries to Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz exposed it even further. The likes of Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli are good, but feel more like they should be squad options than starters.",
      "We happily accept that if Mohamed Salah had gone down with a knee injury in October, Liverpool would have suffered in similar fashion – but not quite as badly. Diaz and Cody Gakpo both broke double figures for goals in the league this season; not a single Arsenal player managed it.",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling and, for similar reasons, Jaden Sancho\nWe are absolutely shocked that Sterling did not turn out to be the solution to that problem for Arsenal. Shocked.",
      "We feel bad for Sterling. As we’ve expressed before, it feels a bit unfair that two different players could each have ten good years in their careers, yet if they have it at the start of their careers they get slated for their decline, whereas if they have them at the end of their careers, they get no stick for having been rubbish before and all the praise for their improvement.",
      "We shouldn’t forget that Sterling was an excellent player for a long time. The problem is that does feel quite firmly past tense now, and he may have to swallow a bit of pride as he weighs up his next move. We doubt another club of Arsenal’s profile will come knocking again this summer.",
      "And while we’re on wingers whose best years look to be behind them…Jadon Sancho was genuinely great for Borussia Dortmund and England a few years ago. Like, he’s not a Francis Jeffers or something, who was just over-hyped out of proportion and was never actually going to get to a top level. He started at a top level.",
      "If he’d been at Chelsea in either of the past two seasons, we could probably write it off as just being another bad career move. But Chelsea have actually been pretty good in spells; Sancho hasn’t. It’s a shame.",
      "",
      "Julen Lopetegui and West Ham\nThe Hammers deciding it was time to move on from David Moyes was harsh, but understandable.",
      "While evidently grateful to the Scot for delivering the Conference League trophy and overseeing a considerable improvement on getting drawn into relegation battles, they want to move on to someone with the ability to push them to the next level. Absolutely fine. We get it.",
      "What we don’t get is why they thought Julen Lopetegui would be that man. Does he just interview incredibly well or something? From Spain to Real Madrid to Wolves, we just don’t see what the enduring fascination is with him.",
      "Not that things have really got much better under Graham Potter, mind, that victory away to Arsenal aside. As with Amorim, it’s hard to judge any mid-season managerial appointment – though Moyes and Vitor Pereira did make our winners list – and we’re interested to see what West Ham have for us next season. Our hunch is they will be quite a bit better.",
      "Still, it must be unbelievably frustrating to be a West Ham fan. Never a step forward without a big step back to follow.",
      "",
      "Newly-promoted clubs, just in general\nThere’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is an absolute gulf.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "",
      "Special mention to Southampton for being especially crap\nDreadful. We’re going to miss saying ‘except against Southampton, which doesn’t count’ every single time we’re talking about another side in a dreadful run of form with one speck of green in it.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur, who are also in the winners list\nAnd this is why we need that jeopardy back.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just centring your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but as we discussed in the winners, even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "",
      "Sean Dyche\nMatt Stead and I had a complete difference of opinion about Dyche’s sacking. I felt it was a risk; yeah, they didn’t score, but wasn’t that because they were a bit crap, and so focusing on defending first and foremost was the only thing likely to keep their heads above water?",
      "No, said Steady. They’re better than Dyche gives them credit for and will do a lot better when they’re given a bit more freedom.",
      "Annoyingly, he was absolutely bang on, of course. By the end of his time at Goodison Park, Dyche was holding Everton back; the results they immediately got after Moyes’ return confirmed as much, as did the genuinely quite impressive attacking form they showed while actually improving their defensive record.",
      "We shouldn’t overlook the enormously difficult situation Dyche inherited, and there’s a case to be made that Everton may not have even been a Premier League club this season without him. But sometimes it’s just time to move on.",
      "",
      "Gary O’Neil\nOn much the same rationale as Dyche, albeit for totally different reasons. The general reporting from those closest to Wolves is that O’Neil, if anything, had too many ideas, and increasingly threw them at his squad as things kept getting worse for them until their brains scrambled.",
      "That is surely only part of it: O’Neil went on record in his final interview as manager to say he had ‘never had such a struggle to help a group cope with real basic stuff’.",
      "It’s less than 18 months ago that O’Neil was being reported as a potential candidate to replace Jurgen Klopp, but after Vitor Pereira went in and turned things around so comprehensively, he has a bit of a job on his hands now to restore his reputation.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez\nAn £85m squad option for the champions, and not a particularly convincing one at that. He’s got talent, there’s no doubt about that, but Liverpool have spent three years waiting for him to add some consistency as well. It seems unlikely he’ll get a fourth.",
      "",
      "Football finance expert Stefan Borson has suggested that Manchester City could sell 10 players before signing any in order to keep Pep Guardiola happy, and safe from quitting.",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and comes out well on top.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has confirmed that four players will be leaving the Emirates Stadium this summer after beating Southampton 2-1 on Sunday.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could not hide his frustrations when asked about Jack Grealish after his side’s win against Fulham on the final day.",

But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton, and made just one excellent stop v Bournemouth. A clean sheet and three saves on the final day at Fulham helped him claim the unofficial best goalkeeper award.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) Alisson (Liverpool): +3.7\nRemarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2. Alisson vs Giorgi Mamardashvili next season will be interesting.",
      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +3.2\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final. Almost kept a clean sheet at Liverpool on the final day but could do nothing about Mohamed Salah’s deflected shot.",
      "",
      "5) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.9% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, which resulted in a shared Golden Glove with David Raya. They can get one hand each.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham Hotspur): +2.4\nSpurs have faced the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.0\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He was an excellent loan signing by the Cherries.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea. Couldn’t do anything to stop the attempts to bottle top five.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.7\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League (76.4%) but still gets pelters from pundits. A clean sheet on the final day at Nottingham Forest got Chelsea in to the Champions League.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever and decided he wanted a piece of that action.",

Both goalkeepers conceded on the final day and shared the award with 13.",
      "",
      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final. Had nothing to do with Altay Bayindir being involved in one of the most controversial moments of the season.",
      "",
      "13) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.8\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it mattered most were supposed to have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine, but then Manchester United away happened.",

      "14) Mark Flekken (Brentford): 0.0\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United. A nice round zero feels right.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Had the worst performance of the entire Premier League season.",
      "",

      "There have been two fresh developments in Man Utd’s pursuit of Joan Garcia, which could increase their chances of landing the Spanish goalkeeper this summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim is actively assessing their goalkeeping options ahead of the transfer window, with doubts continuing to swirl around Andre Onana and backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, who has been tipped to leave.",
      "The Cameroonian has retained his place in recent weeks but endured another difficult campaign at Old Trafford, marked by inconsistency and a series of costly errors, and is expect to stay put.",
      "However, Utd want fresh competition, and Joan Garcia is among the names under consideration. The Espanyol goalkeeper has emerged as a top-level performer in La Liga, finishing the season with a league-high 146 saves and drawing interest from several Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona have stepped up their interest in recent days, with Cadena SER claiming the 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Catalan giants. However, Fabrizio Romano reports that no deal has been reached with Espanyol, while also suggesting that ‘no decision has been made’ on Garcia’s part.",
      "Crucially, Barcelona would plan to sign Garcia and then loan him out for the 2025/26 campaign due to financial constraints.",
      "That could also suit the Red Devils, who are not expected to invest heavily in a new number one this summer amid financial struggles.",
      "A loan deal for a younger goalkeeper capable of challenging Onana, without requiring a major financial outlay, may present a more compelling option.",
      "Further encouragement for United comes from the Spanish national team. Garcia will not be called up by Luis de la Fuente this summer, a decision that carries added weight due to a clause in his contract.",
      "Had he been named in the Spain squad, his release clause would have risen to €30 million. Instead, it remains fixed at €25 million.",
      "The reduced cost could prove vital for United, who are expected to operate with tighter finances this summer and are unlikely to sanction big-money deals without player sales.",
      "Barcelona remain the frontrunners but have salary cap issues to navigate and cannot offer immediate first-team football. That has reportedly led to discussions over a possible loan to another La Liga side, with Valencia and Real Betis both mentioned.",
      "Garcia is yet to make a final decision on his future, and United are expected to monitor developments closely. With Arsenal exploring alternative options and Barcelona’s intentions now clearer, there is renewed optimism at Old Trafford that a deal could be achievable — especially if a compromise can be found that suits all parties.",
      "Newcastle are targeting four La Liga players in a €200m raid as they prepare for life back in the Champions League next season.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United have hijacked Arsenal in the race to sign one of Mikel Arteta’s leading summer transfer targets.",
      "A new report claims Premier League giants Arsenal have already ‘wrapped up’ one summer signing, while another deal is ‘close’ to being completed.",
      "Arsenal are now looking at alternative options for Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia amid fears of Man Utd hijacking a deal, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has ‘found’ his preferred replacement for Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, whose ‘future is uncertain’.",
      "Man Utd could be set to rival Arsenal in the transfer market as they launch a bid to sign La Liga’s highest-rated goalkeeper."

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 13:20, UK",
      "Manchester United will invest in new players this summer, but without Champions League football next season, the club does not need a big squad, says Ruben Amorim.",
      "United recorded their worst-ever Premier League campaign after finishing 15th in the table, losing 18 games in the process, and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final means no European football next season.",
      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",
      "\"So, it is a good thing for us to take advantage of not having European games.\"",
      "Amorim has also stressed the importance of keeping Bruno Fernandes at United this summer as rumours begin to circulate regarding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, which led to Amorim stressing that United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",
      "\"He should be because he is the captain, so he's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Aston Villa lost 2-0 to Man United and missed out on Champions League football on goal difference; Morgan Rogers' goal in the 73rd minute was controversially disallowed but VAR could not intervene due to the whistle being blown; Villa's John McGinn called the decision \"incredible\"",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""
