      "Unai Emery has confirmed that Emi Martinez has been stripped of the vice-captaincy following his summer-long transfer saga with the Argentine no longer wearing the armband for Aston Villa.",
      "Martinez would usually be the team's captain with John McGinn absent, but that wasn't the case on Thursday when Villa took on Maccabi Tel-Aviv. Instead it was England international Ezri Konsa who wore the captain's armband.",
      "The goalkeeper had been tipped to leave Villa Park in the summer and cut an emotional figure in the final home game of last season. Manchester United, who were in the market for a goalkeeper, were seen as his most likely destination.",
      "It is unclear whether taking the vice-captaincy from Martinez is directly linked to the Argentine's failed summer move but he was dropped for the opening matches of the season before being bought back into the fold by Emery.",
      "Emery confirmed on Thursday that Martinez is no longer the club's vice-captain: \"The first captain is John McGinn. We decided how we are, as well as managing the next captain.",
      "\"Usually, we have another captain, Emi Martinez, as second captain. But now, after speaking with him, I prefer to get him back. Konsa is the next one. Tyrone Mings, with Ollie Watkins too. Normally, we are managing it like that.\"",
      "Martinez has been at Villa for four years following his move from Arsenal and has helped them become a Champions League side. Emery dropped him for Marco Bizot in the early weeks and refused to entertain questions on the Argentine. In one post-match interview he simply repeated Bizot's name.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side did not make a formal approach until Martinez returned to Birmingham for pre-season training. Rather than make a permanent bid as was expected they enquired about a potential loan deal, which was quickly knocked back by Villa.",
      "United instead chose to pursue a deal for Royal Antwerp's 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who has since become their No 1. It was thought that those in Manchester were potentially put off by the cost of a move for Martinez. Villa had been seeking £30million for their World Cup winner.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could be on his way out of Manchester United as the January transfer window looms, following a summer filled with speculation about his future. Despite being linked with a move away from Old Trafford during the summer, Mainoo stayed put at United, despite his desire for regular action.",
      "The young midfielder had a promising start under former boss Erik ten Hag, but has found it tough to secure a spot in the starting line-up under Ruben Amorim's reign.",
      "So far this season, Mainoo has only made eight appearances for United and hasn't started a single Premier League match. His sole start was in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town back in September, where he played the full 90 minutes.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has shed some light on Mainoo's situation, hinting that a January move could be on the horizon.",
      "Speaking on the Here We Go podcast, Romano suggested that Mainoo is open to a loan deal that would run until the end of the season.",
      "Amorim recently addressed Mainoo's lack of game time this season, expressing his wish for the Red Devils' campaign to have allowed the midfielder more opportunities on the pitch.",
      "\"I see Kobbie Mainoo training today, and he deserves to play,\" Amorim said in an interview with beIN Sports. \"But then I have to take one guy [out] that is playing really well.",
      "\"We should have played yesterday in the Carabao Cup, because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing, I need to see Josh [Zirkzee].",
      "\"All these guys deserve to play, but in the end, with one game [a week], you need to make choices.",

Spurs beat FC Copenhagen 4-0 in the Champions League in midweek, while United were not in action due to not being involved in Europe this term.",
      "Spurs' triumph was marred by a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea last weekend, while United have been riding high, unbeaten in their last four Premier League matches following a 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's Red Devils currently sit eighth in the table, and unlike Spurs, they're heading into Saturday's clash with almost a non-existent injury list.",
      "Spurs, on the other hand, are facing a mounting injury crisis. Dominic Solanke, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Ben Davies, Radu Dragusin, Kota Takai and Archie Gray are all ruled out.",
      "Lucas Bergvall is also a doubt after suffering a concussion against Chelsea. According to The FA's guidelines, he'll be allowed to undergo a graduated return to full daily activity after an initial 24 to 48 hour period of 'relative rest', reports football.london.",
      "The 19-year-old midfielder will be permitted to train, but only 'at a rate that does not worsen existing symptoms'.",
      "The FA's 'Graduated return to play' (GRTP) programme could see Bergvall sidelined for at least 21 days. However, their 'Enhanced care pathway' for players over 18 allows for a return to play after 12 days – or even seven, provided exceptional criteria are met.",
      "However, there is a glimmer of hope for Spurs, as Mohammed Kudus, who was absent on Tuesday due to an injury, might be fit for this weekend's match. However, it's been suggested that Tottenham boss Thomas Frank could be forced to wait for a full update on the forward's fitness.",
      "Meanwhile, for United, Lisandro Martinez returned to full training last week, but it's still uncertain whether he will make the squad for Saturday's match.",
      "Martinez has been sidelined with a knee injury that he picked up in February, which forced the defender to miss the final months of last season and the opening months of the current campaign.",
      "Amorim confirmed on Thursday that United had no fresh injury concerns going into the clash against Tottenham. \"No, there’s no change [to what we are doing about injuries],\" said Amorim.",
      "\"It’s one game every week and then a little bit of luck, because sometimes you have problems with players with knocks, it’s not something that is soft tissues.",
      "\"So you never know what is going to happen in the next training. If you play with intensity in training, something can happen, but I think the big reason… of course, we try to do everything well, the big reason is [we have only] one game every week.",

      "Former Manchester United star Lee Sharpe believes we have \"seen the end of Andre Onana\" with the goalkeeper currently out on loan following an underwhelming two years at Old Trafford.",
      "Onana was bought in with big expectations having just made the Champions League final with Inter Milan but his time at the Red Devils has been plagued by constant errors and mistakes leading directly to goals.",
      "After plenty of summer noise surrounding a possible exit he did eventually leave, but only once the Premier League's transfer window had closed. He headed to Turkey to join Trabzonspor, who agreed to pay all of his wages, and United have since pressed on with Senne Lammens.",
      "The young Belgian was signed in the summer but has come into the team and largely impressed, keeping a clean sheet on debut, and bringing a sense of calm to the backline with Sharpe adamant he'll now replace Onana.",
      "The ex-United star told Adventure Gamers: \"I would be very surprised if Andre Onana came back to the club after leaving on loan in the summer. Senne Lammens looks to have made that position his own now, and I don’t think Onana would want to come back and play second fiddle. I think we have seen the end of Onana at Old Trafford.\"",
      "Onana had previously been defiant about his qualities and often pointed to his history of success as proof of his skillset. However he was dropped for a game last term by Ruben Amorim and a summer injury meant he missed the start of the season.",
      "Altay Bayindir came in and struggled, Onana was recalled for the shock loss at Grimsby and again made an error, but Lammens has looked a lot more assured in between the sticks. He was part of the team that won at Liverpool recently and Sharpe has compared him to two of the club's great modern day shot stoppers.",
      "\"Senne Lammens has made some great saves already for Manchester United and seems very calm. I’ve seen a few comparisons to Peter Schmeichel, but Peter certainly wasn’t calm! I can see similarities between the two in the shot stopping category and in the way he commands his box, he isn’t afraid of coming for crosses, in the same way Peter was.",
      "\"I actually see a combination of similarities between Peter and Edwin van der Sar with Lammens; he has the calmness and presence of Edwin but the shot stopping and goalkeeping prowess of Peter. I hope it’s not a flash in the pan for him and Manchester United and this can continue.\"",

Socceroos manager Tony Popovic has included 11 new faces in his squad, with United academy talent Overy poised to continue his meteoric ascent following his impressive displays at the U20 World Cup.",
      "Overy, who celebrates his 18th birthday this weekend, joined United during the summer of 2024 on a scholarship agreement before securing a professional deal in July. In May, Ruben Amorim brought him and several other youngsters into first-team training at Carrington prior to the Premier League encounter with Chelsea.",
      "Former Under-18s manager Adam Lawrence praised Overy's ability to bounce back from the long-term injury. “It’s been really hard for James because obviously he’s made the move from Australia and he’s a terrific lad, first of all,\" he told MUTV.",
      "“But he got injured in pre-season and you can see he’s such a great lad, a great kid and has such good energy and he wanted to be back. A real credit to him because he stayed positive throughout.",
      "\"It’s not affected him in terms of his positivity. And listen, it’s obviously disappointing what’s happened in the game, but for him to be back and playing football again is brilliant.\"",
      "Looking ahead to the forthcoming international window, Overy will now aim to take the next leap in his career after earning his place in the Australia squad. Injuries to several established players have prompted Popovic to hand opportunities to numerous fresh faces.",
      "\"It's another opportunity to expand the depth and introduce players who have not yet been exposed to the Socceroos environment or senior international football,\" Popovic said. \"We also welcome back some familiar faces, from Australia and abroad.",
      "\"I've had the chance to closely observe the opening rounds of the A-League season, and we believe this is the ideal time to integrate domestic players into the squad. We are delighted to be back in the United States to face strong South American opposition as we continue our preparations for the World Cup.\"",
      "Australia will take on Venezuela in Houston on November 14 before facing Colombia in New York. The international break represents one of the final opportunities for players to stake their claim ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",

      "Mainoo, 20, has not started a match in the Premier League thus far, and failed to get off the bench against Nottingham Forest last time out. The academy product has seen his momentum stall under Amorim after breaking into the side in 2023/24 and earning an England call-up.",
      "The talented youngster was denied an opportunity to move on loan in the summer, but has almost been surplus to requirements this term with United playing just one game per week. United's Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby is proving particularly damaging in this respect.",
      "And Amorim has conceded that Mainoo's training ground performances have been good enough to warrant a place in his starting lineup, but suggested he does not have the space to offer an opportunity. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have started ahead of the youngster.",
      "Amorim is taking advantage of the opportunity to better prepare his side, however. The Portuguese coach believes his side's schedule was problematic last term.",
      "\"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports. \"We are giving a lot of information, we are working on our fitness because we need to keep momentum during the week with good training, really intense.",

We should have played in the Carabao Cup, because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing, I need to see Josh, all of these guys deserve to play, but in the end, it is one more game you need to make choices. So you have both sides.\"",
      "Qualifying for Europe this term is vital for Amorim, simply to manage his squad. “We need to go to Europe because of everything,” he said. “Our club needs to be in Europe, it’s hard to have a very, very good squad.",
      "“Imagine for me to have Mainoo with that (many) minutes that he’s playing, he needs more games for me to make a rotation because, with one game (a week), it’s really hard.",

      "Sancho made just his third start of the season on Thursday night as he came into the side with Donyell Malen and Evann Guessand as Ollie Watkins dropped out. Goals from former Chelsea ace Ian Maatsen and Malen either side of half-time, secured victory for Emery's men, to take them sixth in the league phase of their European competition.",
      "Former Borussia Dortmund star Sancho lasted 75 minutes before being replaced by Youri Tielemans and he was just one of two players who did not impress Petrov. The ex-Celtic midfielder believes Sancho had an opportunity but failed to take advantage.",
      "\"I'm not sure if I can say that for Sancho and Guessand. I'm a bit disappointed there.\"",
      "Sancho's performance comes in the aftermath of being substituted on and off the pitch against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery, explaining his decisions. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",
      "With Sancho set to return from Old Trafford following his loan, it appears United chiefs have already made up their minds, however. The club are ready to let him leave for nothing next summer despite stumping up £73million five years ago.",
      "The Red Devils have the option to trigger a 12-month extension as Sancho's deal runs out in the summer. But United do not want to risk paying his £200,000-a-week wages if they fail to find a buyer, it is said.",

      "Manchester United are on their best run of form in recent times and are aiming to take three points from Tottenham on Saturday. The Red Devils will travel to London for the early kick-off at 12:30pm after a week's training at Carrington.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been on an upward trajectory recently, with three wins and one draw in their last four games. The most notable victory came at Anfield against Liverpool, where Harry Maguire scored the winner to beat their rivals 2-1.",
      "The Glazers, who are the majority stakeholders at United, could be convinced to sell their shares in the club if 'the price is right'. The American business family has faced intense criticism from fans regarding the management of the Premier League side in recent times.",
      "Earlier this season, speculation about a potential takeover from a new investor emerged but has since been squashed by United officials. However, The Times reports that if the money was what the Glazers deemed worthwhile, then they could be persuaded to sell their stake in the club.",
      "The report reads: \"I think for the right price, [the Glazers] definitely would [sell]. There is a clause within Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought the club - I think it was triggered in August this year - that meant if the right offer came in - and I think that it was over something like $33 a share - that the Glazers could sell the whole club.",
      "\"Not just their portion of it, but Sir Ratcliffe will be bought out, as well, so there is potential that the Glazers could sell the entire club but, at the minute, it just seems like a strange one with this news, this hype and this excitement that's been triggered by this one tweet.\"",
      "The Glazers last addressed their takeover stance publicly in April when youngest sibling Edward said: \"I think that... We're a family business, and it was really a decision we made collectively.",
      "\"Not every decision is six-nothing. But, ultimately, why we have been successful as a family business is that we've always kind of agreed that, if the majority of family members want to do something, we realise we are in a family business and we have to do it.",
      "\"One day it might be something that I'm in favour of. The next day, it may be something I'm not in favour. It was a family decision [the minority takeover].\"",
      "Sir David Beckham celebrated receiving a knighthood from King Charles by dining at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Chelsea. The former United star was handed the accolade for his services to sport and charity earlier this week and was spotted enjoying a meal at the Michelin-starred eatery.",
      "The Sun reports that Beckham was joined at the dinner table by wife Victoria and his family, which included sons Cruz and Romeo, daughter Harper and his parents, Ted and Sandra. Close friend and restaurant owner Ramsay was also in attendance alongside his wife Tana, as well as Beckham's friend Dave Gardner and his wife Jessica Clarke.",
      "The Beckhams' oldest son, Brooklyn, wasn't spotted at the celebratory dinner, as tensions continue within the family. The 26-year-old is yet to publicly congratulate his father on the honour, as Sir David shared his joy at receiving such an important accolade.",
      "Speaking after the ceremony, the 50-year-old said: \"I couldn't be prouder. People know how patriotic I am - I love my country. I've always said how important the monarchy is to my family. I'm lucky enough to have travelled around the world and all people want to talk to me about is our monarchy. It makes me proud.\"",

      "Enzo Maresca claimed Manchester United were a better side AFTER Erik ten Hag was sacked amid reports that he is edging towards a managerial return. The Dutchman left Old Trafford in October 2024 following a dire start to the campaign.",
      "Ten Hag returned to football this summer as he took the reins from Xabi Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen. But he lasted just three games with the Bundesliga side as they opted to make a surprisingly swift change in the dugout.",
      "Ten Hag could yet find a role over the next few days having been linked with a move to Wolves - albeit they have now made an approach for Middlesbrough boss Rob Edwards. Nevertheless, Ajax are also reportedly mulling over a move for their former boss after sacking John Heitinga.",
      "Regardless, his former Premier League rival Enzo Maresca made his feelings on Ten Hag clear and previously claimed that the Red Devils would potentially have been a tougher opponent after the Dutchman was jettisoned.",
      "Speaking ahead of a meeting between United and Chelsea shortly after Ten Hag's exit, he said: “Yes, for sure,” before adding: “When you change manager, always for the first one, two, three games, you can see the reaction from the players,” he added. “So, probably it will be [tougher]. But in any case it will be a tough game.”",
      "Ten Hag has remained silent over a switch back to the dugout, albeit did release a statement following his exit from Leverkusen. He said: \"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented.",

      "Since the summer transfer window shut United have already seen some their talent excel elsewhere. Rasmus Hojlund was regarded as a flop but has been in the goals ever since moving to Napoli. He's continued the trend of players who find form once leaving Manchester.",

      "He said: \"He (Maresca) wanted me to help the team, come on and play my part. I scored to equalise, but it’s not enough. We needed to score another. It was a good finish, and I just tried to help the team with a goal or an assist, or even just hard work, but I wanted to win the game.

      "Ex-Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has reportedly held talks over a return to former club Ajax. Ten Hag is available after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the season and has recently been linked with a return to the Premier League.",
      "The Dutchman was among the names shortlisted by Wolves as they continue the search for a replacement for the sacked Vitor Pereira. Ten Hag is looking for a new club having been sacked by Leverkusen just two Bundesliga games into the season.",
      "Dutch outlet AD says that Ten Hag has already held talks with Ajax chiefs over the possibility of succeeding John Heitinga as boss, who was sacked on Thursday. Ajax are fourth in the Eredivisie and were thrashed 3-0 at home by Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday night in what proved to be the final straw for Heitinga.",
      "Heitinga left his role on Arne Slot’s coaching staff at Liverpool to take over at Ajax in the summer, but won just five of his 15 games in charge. The 41-year-old was dismissed in a statement on Thursday afternoon. Technical director Alex Kroes said: \"It's a painful decision. But looking back at the past few months, we must conclude that things have turned out quite differently from what we had envisioned. We’ve seen too little progress and have unnecessarily dropped points.\"",
      "The loss against Galatasaray made it one win in the last seven games for Heitinga, who saw supporters call for his sacking post-match. One supporter group released a statement on Wednesday which read: “This is no longer sustainable. The decline in the sport must be halted now. The AFCA Supporters Club has enormous respect for Heitinga as a player. But now we are judging him as a coach.”",
      "Ajax’s players have also painted a worrying picture, with Davy Klaasen failing to back Heitinga while saying there was “little foundation” and “little development” post-match. It now seems as though Ten Hag could be the man to fill the void after Fred Grim was appointed as interim boss.",
      "Kroes has reportedly met with Ten Hag this week and his previous success with the club could land him a return. The 55-year-old coach won 73 per cent of his games between January 2018 and May 2022, winning three Eredivisie titles and two domestic cups while also getting Ajax to the Champions League semi-finals.",

      "Ronaldo said Amorim was fighting an uphill battle to turn things around at United due to the structures in place around him. But while agreeing that mistakes had been made, Amorim unsurprisingly painted a much more positive picture of the club today.",
      "\"Of course, he knows he has huge impact on everything he says,\" he said in a press conference ahead of United's game against Tottenham on Saturday. \"But what we need to focus on is in future. We know as a club we made a lot of mistakes in the past. We are trying to change that.",

      "“For me, I'm sad because of the club, that’s one of the most important clubs in the world, and a club that I still have in my heart because of the obvious reasons,\" he told Morgan.",
      "He added: “You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have [done] so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary, Roy Keane, Beckham, they became big players but they had youth. So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure.",
      "“I hope that changes in the future, present/future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",

And he’s not gonna do miracles. They have good players, but they don’t have, some of them, in mind what Manchester United is.”",

      "Manchester United will be on high alert following shock reports that Barcelona boss Hansi Flick may depart the club at the end of the campaign. United academy product Marcus Rashford, currently on loan with the Spanish heavyweights, is tipped to make his move to the Nou Camp permanent after some stellar performances since his transfer to Spain earlier this season.",
      "Barcelona's German head coach is a huge admirer of the England ace, who has netted an impressive six goals and provided seven assists in 15 matches across all competitions this season. The 28-year-old appears to be rediscovering his top form after falling out of favour under United manager Ruben Amorim, having spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Earlier this week, Spanish outlet ABC claimed that Flick had told his coaching staff he plans to step down from Barcelona due to reportedly growing 'tired' of the atmosphere among the players, pointing to issues in the dressing room.",
      "However, Sky Germany have dismissed these claims, which will come as a significant boost for Rashford and his aspirations of sealing a permanent switch to Barcelona.",
      "The recent report insists Flick is thoroughly content at the Catalan club and is contracted until the summer of 2027, highlighting his ambitious plans for the club's future.",
      "Earlier this season, Rashford opened up about the impact Flick has had on his game during a chat with TNT Sport, saying: \"He's very important. I feel the confidence he's given me.",
      "\"I knew he was a top manager before I arrived here, but to work with him is a pleasure. I hope the good relationship will continue for the rest of the season.\"",
      "Flick's admiration for Rashford is evident, as he showered praise on the striker after United's 3-1 victory over Elche in La Liga.",
      "\"One or two more goals would have been good for him,\" he said. \"I'm happy with him; I know he can play at this level and he's shown it. He's an important player.\"",
      "Rashford wasn't quite able to continue his impressive form for Barca in their recent 3-3 draw with Belgian side Club Brugge in the Champions League.",
      "So far this season, the England international has four goals and two assists in Europe's elite competition, but drew a blank in Belgium on Wednesday night.",
      "Barcelona have an option to sign Rashford at the end of the season and make the England international's move to Catalonia permanent, with United setting out their stance by including the clause in the deal.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's firm, Ineos, has reportedly agreed to cough up over £11million to swiftly settle a lawsuit with Tottenham Hotspur. The company, owned by the Manchester United co-owner, was accused of breaching a five-year minimum contract worth £17.5m that allowed Tottenham to promote the firm's Grenadier as the club's \"official 4X4 vehicle partner.\"",
      "The deal was thought to have been inked in 2022, but Ineos had been partnered with Spurs since they were dubbed the club's \"official hand-sanitiser supplier\" during the Covid-19 outbreak. Tottenham called time on their deal with Ratcliffe's company in March and initiated legal proceedings three months later.",
      "They claim an annual instalment exceeding £5m was not paid on December 1, having already allegedly missed an inflation-related payment of around £500,000.",
      "According to the Telegraph, the total sum paid to Spurs remains under wraps, but a source close to the matter suggested the agreed amount was about half what the north Londoners were seeking. Furthermore Spurs were after nearly £5.3m in damages when the deal was terminated with more than two years left on the clock. Shortly thereafter, Ineos hit back by counter-suing Spurs for over £1m.",
      "They pointed the finger at the north Londoners for engaging in sponsorship talks with Audi, which were tied to Harry Kane's potential transfer to Bayern Munich. Ineos stated: \"On or around 3 August 2023 (i.e. early in contract year two), Todd Kline of the club indicated to Ashley Reed of Ineos that the club had been in discussions with the German car manufacturer Audi AG in connection with rights which were the same as, or substantially similar to, the rights granted to Ineos under the agreement and/or the club had been negotiating with Audi in respect of rights which were exclusive to Ineos under clause 4 of the agreement.",
      "\"According to Mr Kline, the discussions and/or negotiations related to a proposed transfer of the club's player Harry Kane to the German club FC Bayern Munich.\"",
      "Ineos' defence also claimed the commercial partnership had \"not materialised\" before stating \"this sequence of events ultimately resulted in the parties agreeing that Ineos could terminate the agreement with effect from the end of year three of the contract term”",
      "They firmly stated: \"In the circumstances, it is the club which owes Ineos more than £1m for failing to provide any rights to Ineos in the final part of year three.\"",
      "Spurs acknowledged holding commercial discussions with Audi, but rejected suggestions these talks gave Ineos the right to terminate their agreement, given that Tottenham never finalised a deal with the German car manufacturer. Tottenham maintain the arrangement with Ineos \"involved annual payments starting at £2.125m in year one and increasing to £4.6m in year five, all plus VAT and index-linked to the rate of inflation\" and that they would be pursuing interest \"further or other relief as the court thinks fit\".",
      "At the time, an Ineos spokesperson said: \"Ineos Automotive was a partner of Tottenham Hotspur from 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020. We had a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right.\"",
      "Ineos have severed links with numerous major sports teams they had been backing. They have already ended partnerships with Ben Ainslie's sailing squad and the New Zealand All Blacks rugby union side.",
      "In February, the Telegraph also reported the latter were launching legal action, claiming their agreement, which was expected to run until 2027, was terminated prematurely, despite a contract being in place.",
      "Ineos have argued they have been compelled into cost-cutting due to \"extreme\" green carbon taxes in Europe. Ratcliffe has pointed the finger at escalating energy prices and taxes as the reasoning behind the firm's decision to shut down their synthetic ethanol plant in Grangemouth, Scotland. This move resulted in the loss of 80 direct roles and an additional 500 indirect jobs.",

      "Liverpool and Manchester United are keeping tabs on German wonderkid Kennet Eichhorn, who Hertha Berlin are willing to let go for £17million. Eichhorn, 16, is making waves in Berlin after breaking into Hertha's first-team this season.",
      "The defensive midfielder has made eight appearances in the German second tier, forcing some of Europe's biggest clubs to take notice. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen have all reportedly sent scouts to watch Eichhorn.",
      "Premier League delegates are also regulars at the Olympiastadion. It's claimed that Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Manchester City have all began scouting him.",
      "German publication Bild, via Mundo Deportivo, report that Hertha have already told interested parties that they'd consider an offer worth €20m (£17m). Eichhorn got his chance in the first-team because of injuries but he's managed to keep his place thanks to a string of impressive performances.",
      "\"He is an incredible, exceptional talent,\" team-mate Fabian Reese hailed following the 16-year-old's debut. \"If he continues like this, all doors will be open to him. I have rarely seen anyone so talented at that age. He has a huge career ahead of him.\"",
      "Boss Stefan Leitl has also waxed lyrical after the match, saying: \"I couldn't care less whether he's 16 or 17. He's a huge talent for Hertha. In many of his actions, you could see what we might be seeing from him in the coming years. I'm completely convinced of his abilities; he did a great job.\"",
      "Eichhorn signed a new contract in July and has earned comparisons to ex-Germany star Toni Kroos because of his ability to control the tempo of a game. Kroos' brother, Felix, has urged him to stay at Hertha for two to four more years and help them return to the Bundesliga.",
      "Speaking to RTL, Kroos explained: \"That's the beauty of football: there isn't one right path, no magic formula. Still, Eichhorn, at 16, is a special case and should remain in his familiar environment.",
      "Who should Kennet Eichhorn sign for - Liverpool or Manchester United? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "\"That's what brought him to where he is now. A move to Bayern or [Borussia] Dortmund in the next two to four years would be too early. I hope he develops at Hertha for a few more years. Ultimately, you can't plan anything in football.",
      "\"If it goes well and Eichhorn stays another two or three years, those six million (euros) could become 60 million. That would be even better for the books in Berlin. And with the sums circulating today, six million is too little anyway.\"",
      "He added: \"The way Eichhorn plays is remarkable. He radiates calm, gains valuable experience, and is allowed to make mistakes. He has the quality, yet he will sometimes sit out. You have to give such a young player a break because it's a lot for the mind.\"",

      "Vitor Roque's agent is bracing for offers around €50million (£44m) in the January transfer window. Manchester United and several European clubs are reportedly closely monitoring his situation at Palmeiras.",
      "The forward has netted 13 goals in 28 matches since making his comeback to the Brazilian side from Barcelona. Roque was purchased for roughly £22million in February, setting a record as the most expensive player in South American football history, and his impressive form in Brazil has caught the attention of numerous clubs.",
      "He is now sparking rumours of a potential move in January. United and Chelsea are clubs credited as the 'most interested' parties in the race, with West Ham United also showing interest.",
      "Ruben Amorim is said to be mulling over adding a new striker to his squad at Old Trafford to challenge Benjamin Sesko. The United manager has barely utilised Joshua Zirkzee, and speculation about the Dutchman's future has triggered a possible chain reaction.",
      "Fabrizio Romano recently dismissed rumours about Endrick moving to United as having zero chance of happening, despite the teenager getting the green light to leave Real Madrid. The expectation is that he will join Lyon on loan.",
      "Roque's name continues to circulate in the transfer gossip columns. In conversation with Globo Esporte, the striker's agent disclosed that his team are anticipating bids when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Andre Cury, one of the agents at Link Sports, said: \"Today we're receiving a barrage of calls from European clubs, mainly Premier League and Italian clubs. They're calling to ask about the price and terms, but we're in the middle of the season.",
      "\"We already had an offer from the Arab world of 35 million euros, which wasn't of interest, and now we're going to get a proposal in the region of 50 million euros from the Premier League.\" The outlet claims Cury ruled out United being among those to approach him.",
      "Roque's agent also said, \"The plan was to come back here, get strong again, and also study the market. If a good offer comes along for everyone and they understand that he has to leave, he's open to listening, but he's very happy at Palmeiras.",
      "\"The focus now is on trying to win the Brazilian Championship and the Libertadores Cup.\" Their league campaign continues until early December, with Palmeiras currently sitting at the summit, holding a slender one-point advantage over Flamengo.",

      "Although Ruben Amorim oversaw a disastrous 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, United reached the final of the Europa League and had the opportunity to win a trophy against Tottenham.",
      "Tottenham had not won a trophy since 2008, but they edged a scrappy Europa League final to claim a 1-0 win at the San Mames Stadium. The result meant United failed to qualify for European football for only the second time since English clubs returned to UEFA competition after a five-year ban in 1990.",
      "United will play Spurs this weekend for the first time since they were defeated in Bilbao.",
      "Yoro said: \"I think the team now is in good momentum. We drew the last game, but before this we won, I think, three games in a row. We know we can do better than last game, but we're still in good momentum.",
      "\"We're still confident. Like you said, this game against Tottenham will be important for us to go into the international break with three points. This is going to help us to be in the top of the league, so we need to win this game.\"",
      "When asked about seeking revenge, he responded: \"Yes, everyone knows what happened in the final, so I think this game can be a good game for us to prove that maybe the final can have another result. Every game is important for us. This one is not more important than the other one, but we want to win every game.\"",
      "Yoro continued: \"Yes, it was important for us, I think, for Champions League next year, so this year, but now we cannot change nothing. We have one game a week now.",
      "\"So I think it helped us a little bit to work more on the things that were not good last year. We have more time to work now, but of course everyone wants to play Champions League, so this final is important for us, so this year we need to do better.",
      "\"We are the same team, so I'm not going to say we're a better team, but we can see on the result that there are some things we do better. Of course, we had some new players.",
      "\"And they give everything they have to help us to be better also. We're the same team, but with a different spirit sometimes, I think, and with more work time.\"",

      "\"So, like you said, try to be focused on the team. Don't do any drama. Just speak with everyone, have a good relationship. This is the best, I think, for the team. We cannot build something with bad energy or bad atmosphere or bad characters. I think the club is doing well with this.\"",
      "Yoro added: \"I have a good relationship with everyone, but I stay more with Kobbie [Mainoo], also Amad, he speaks French also. Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu, Ayden [Heaven], the young guys.",
      "\"We stay a lot together, but everyone has a good relation. I have a really good relation with Cunha, Shaw, Bruno, everyone. The thing that's good is that there is no group of friends in the team.",
      "\"This is just one group of friends. This is the best for the team, I think, to not have any drama or something like this. And Kobbie, yeah, sometimes he brings me to some places in Manchester.\"",
      "Yoro and Mainoo are so close that they enjoyed a holiday together before pre-season. \"Before I arrived at the club, I spoke with him also because we had some guys in relation,\" he said.",
      "\"When I came here, he was someone I was with every time. Of course, we have the same age, we have the same relationship. When you have someone like this in your team, it's important to have a good relation. He's a top guy. We spend the holiday together. It's important for us to have this type of relation.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Yoro from Lille for €62million (£54m) plus €8m (£7m) in the summer of 2024. Real Madrid were long-term admirers of Yoro and were heavily linked with making an offer for him.",
      "The Frenchman was asked about Madrid's interest and said: \"Yeah, I know the media, sometimes there's some information that's not completely true sometimes. This is some choice you need to make in your career.",
      "\"I've had a couple of clubs [showing an interest], not just Madrid or United, I had a lot of clubs. Today my choice is Manchester, so I'm really happy with this.",
      "\"I know some people talked about this last year because of the results. I can understand them, but honestly, it's my choice, my career. I know what I'm doing, and I'm just going to be better in the future.\"",
      "Yoro's first season in Manchester did not go as planned. He fractured his metatarsal before the campaign, United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost against Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "\"Honestly, I think the experience, especially when you're centre-half, it's really important,\" Yoro said about whether the Premier League had been an eye-opener.",
      "\"I'm just 19, but when you're on the pitch, you don't care about this. If I have a duel with a 30-year-old guy, I'm not going to think about my age, but in terms of some situations, some duels, I think sometimes you need this experience.",
      "\"When you see guys like Harry [Maguire], De Ligt, Shaw, the experienced guys like this, they have some way to face the situation. When you're a centre-half, it depends when you start your career.",
      "\"But especially around 25, 24, or even 27, this is like your peak level because of the experience you have on the pitch. A different way to face the situation is important sometimes.\"",
      "Yoro continued: \"I think everyone knows last season was a really emotional season, I'm going to say. Not even for the coach, for everyone. It was tough, honestly, it was tough for us.",
      "\"To sometimes face the games, face training. So everyone was emotional, to be honest. I think this year is different. Like you say, we didn't have the Champions League, but if you can take the good way of this, we have more time to train, we have more freedom in our head.",
      "\"So, the coach is not different from last year, it's just the result that is different. And every footballer knows that when you win on the day, you have a really perfect week after. It's more about the result in the head. It's not as emotional as last year, I'm going to say.\"",
      "Yoro did not regret his decision to sign for United during a challenging first 12 months. \"I said a couple of times, even with last season, I never had this feeling of regret or something like this,\" he said.",
      "\"I know Manchester United, I know sometimes you can have a bad season, but this club is a top club, so you cannot have doubts about this. I know the project of the club also before I came.",
      "\"Of course, I cannot expect the first year to finish in 15th position. These are some things you need to face also. But you have the director of the club, the coach, all the players, they're here to push you every day. You have confidence in this club. You need to put your heads up every day and try to do your best.\"",
      "United enjoyed an excellent October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which silenced the conversation about Ruben Amorim's system and his future.",
      "\"I have no problem with the system,\" said Yoro. \"I say a couple of times I like to play with three defenders, have more freedom. It's not about the system. You can see we won games against back four and things like this.",
      "\"Last year, people were saying this because of the results, but you can see this year it's better than last year, but we have the same system. We just need to work on small things. But for me, I have no preference [between three or four at the back]. I can play both, and if I'm on the pitch, I'm happy.\"",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests.",
      "\"I think it's just the preference of the coach to do this,\" he explained. \"We get used to it now, since last year, so it's not a problem for us. For example, I know if I'm coming off and Nous (Mazraoui) is coming on like in the last game, I know he's going to give something more to the team.",
      "\"This is something we get used to and it's not a problem for us. Yes [Amorim has explained why he makes the changes], but I cannot tell you everything he's saying to us. Of course, we speak with him every time, especially the defenders.",
      "\"I think it's important for us to understand everything and to know why sometimes he's doing some changes. We had some conversations about this, but this is not a problem for us. Like I said, if I'm on the pitch and I'm happy, if someone subs me, we can add something to the team.\"",
      "Yoro has started on the right of the back-three, meaning he combines with Amad and Mbeumo. \"When I play with Amad and Bryan, I know that Amad likes to attack a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"He's defending also, but of course, it's not the same as if I'm with Diogo Dalot or Mazraoui, because they're more defensive guys, but it's good for me also to have two guys in front who can really attack every time.",
      "\"I'm here also to help them to have the freedom to attack and stay on the back to protect, but I think it's good for them to have two people to attack like this.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Amad have gone viral for celebrating with a Homer Simpson dance. \"Bryan saw a video on the internet and he started doing it, Amad joined in and I joined him after. We said if we score on the weekend, maybe we can do it, but I was too far in defence, so they did it without me,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"It's Homer Simpson doing this. It's crazy, but I can't remember. We need to ask Mbeumo for this. It's funny.\"",
      "United's players have focused on practising defending set-pieces in training. \"Even more than last year,\" said Yoro about the growing importance of set-plays.",
      "\"You can see with Arsenal, they do really well on this, even the long throw this year. We work more on this in training, of course. I think every team does it. You have a coach for this, we are really focused on this. You can save the game, you can kill your game, so we're really focused on this.\"",
      "And they are focused on returning to Europe. \"When you're at Manchester United, you need to play in Europe, especially with what happened last year. Everyone knows our idea is to be in the top, to be in the Champions League, of course. I think we can reach it,\" he explained.",
      "Yoro named Sergio Ramos, Rio Ferdinand and Raphael Varane as defenders he admires. Ferdinand spoke to Yoro to advise him when he signed and predicted he would \"grow\" enormously this season.",
      "The Frenchman has been watching footage of Ferdinand to improve aspects of his own game. It looks to be paying off.",

      "\"We are more confident,\" said Ruben Amorim on Thursday about Manchester United's progress.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United have improved since the Europa League final. \"We manage better the moments of the game,\" he said. \"But if you remember that game, they had that shot on the goal and won the game. I expect a different game. We can play better, but also have a little bit of luck to win.\"",
      "United will face Tottenham on Saturday for the first time since the Europa League final in Bilbao and they will visit London having gone undefeated in four matches, winning three of those games.",
      "Amorim was bullish about United's chances of gaining revenge at his pre-match press conference, and the mood around the club has shifted after a string of superb results in October.",
      "Only four players who started against Tottenham at the San Mames Stadium - Luke Shaw, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Amad - are practically guaranteed starters this weekend.",
      "Amorim discussed \"confidence\" when explaining why United have become a better team since the final, but acquiring the right personnel in the summer was the most decisive factor.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have been transformational signings. They arrived with Premier League experience, so were relatively low-risk investments, and have hit the ground running this season.",
      "Amorim made further big decisions at both ends of the pitch which have been just as important, shipping out Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana to Italy and Turkey respectively.",
      "The decision to axe Hojlund was slightly harsh. He wanted to stay and fight for his place - and would have benefited from playing as the back-up striker this season - but Amorim had seen enough.",
      "Hojlund did not score enough goals last season and paid the price. United looked toothless with Hojlund up front in the Europa League final and signing a new striker was a non-negotiable.",
      "Benjamin Sesko arrived with a similar profile to Hojlund, given his age and lack of experience in the Premier League, and he looks to be gradually finding his feet in Manchester after a slow start at the club.",
      "Gary Neville said Sesko was \"miles off it\" after the Nottingham Forest draw. Neville has copped flak for his comment, but Sesko would concede he would like to have more than two goals to his name by this point in the season.",
      "Sesko has huge potential and can become a 20-goal-per-season forward. The decision to sign him from RB Leipzig should pay off in eventually, although United fans may have to be patient.",
      "That is why Senne Lammens' performances have been so impressive. Every young foreign player must be given time to adapt to the Premier League, but Lammens has made a seamless transition.",
      "Amorim delayed Lammens' debut and finally played him against Sunderland last month. The \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chant was enough to tell you how he performed that day.",
      "Lammens looks remarkably confident and assured for a 23-year-old playing in one of the most difficult positions at the most scrutinised club in the country, but it becomes obvious when he speaks why he has made such an impact - he is laid back, confident and intelligent.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day,\" said Lammens after the Liverpool victory. He celebrated by having dinner with a close friend.",
      "The Belgian has been viewed as a huge upgrade on Onana after just four appearances. He oozes confidence, whereas Onana was error-prone and made his teammates second-guess themselves.",
      "The decisions from Amorim to freshen up the top and bottom of the team should both pay off, but the Lammens decision has immediately paid off, while Sesko is a work in progress.",
      "That does not mean Lammens cannot improve or that Sesko has not been a good signing. Lammens will inevitably make mistakes and Sesko has looked sharp, he just needs a few more goals to his name.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window (excluding add-ons) and the recruitment looks good.",
      "United have not been able to say that about many transfer windows across the last decade.",

      "Ruben Amorim admitted Manchester United have made \"mistakes\" in the past after a comment from Cristiano Ronaldo this week.",
      "Ronaldo sat down for another candid interview with Piers Morgan. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner discussed Amorim, saying: \"He's doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles.\"",
      "United head coach Amorim played alongside Ronaldo with Portugal's national team and he smiled as he was asked about his comment. \"Of course, he knows and he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" he said.",
      "\"What we need to focus on is the future. We know that we as a club made a lot of mistakes in the past and we are trying to change that. Let's not focus on what happened.",

      "Amorim insisted he was focused on the future and spoke about the importance of improving United's defensive record this season. He said: \"It's a problem, especially if you see the league nowadays. The team winning lots of games is not suffering goals, or shots on target.",
      "\"And that is a big game, especially when you have talented players. In one opportunity, you can score a goal and win the game. But I think it's more a team thing, we need to defend better.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive. And we defend better when we have more energy. We have a lot to do and cannot suffer the amount of goals we are suffering, which we need to improve.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether United could reduce their number of goals conceded without compromising their attacking threat. \"I think you can attack really well. Sometimes when you defend better, you attack better,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it's not that, it's the way we defend the box, but the last game we struggled inside the box because we allowed the crosses into the box without any pressure.",
      "\"These small details that you watched during the last game, we have worked on that. In our last game, they had 17 shots and we cannot allow that. It's something we need to change.",
      "\"We can attack the same way, score even more goals, but we need to defend better.\"",

      "\"Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost. Are they attainable? With Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach,\" he told MUTV's Inside Carrington podcast.",
      "In truth, this is exactly what any self-respecting Premier League club should be doing. If United are going to be sustained challengers in the top four, they need to be planning all-year round.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Wilcox did not say which position they are looking to strengthen next in the market. But it doesn't take a genius to know that the central defensive midfield slot will be the next to be looked at.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season and while United hold an option to extend that deal by a further year, the Reds would want the Brazilian to extend on lower terms. This will, of course, require fresh negotiations and the 33-year-old is under no obligations to agree to them.",
      "Therefore, when he does leave which could be 2026 or 2027, United will need to sign a replacement. When they do that, Wilcox has dropped a huge hint as to where they will be looking.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area and we needed players we could plug in and play with little transition time,\" he explained. \"Senne we were always looking at goalkeepers who have huge potential and Senne was available so we decided to move. It wasn’t a knee-jerk reaction.\"",
      "Like bolstering the attack, the search for a new defensive midfielder looks like it will be focused on players who can slot in seamlessly - especially those who are currently in the Premier League. There is a catch to this plan, though.",
      "Firstly, signing a player from a Premier League club comes at a premium. You only have to look back at the deal for Mbeumo to see that the negotiations can be long and difficult with division rivals.",
      "Then, once that deal is finally complete, you can end up spending more than you originally planned for. That is not to say that Mbeumo is struggling to live up to his price tag - but it is something to consider.",
      "When you take into account the big defensive midfield signings in recent years like Moises Caicedo to Chelsea and Declan Rice to Arsenal, the £100m mark has already been breached. That is also the figure that Brighton quoted United for Carlos Baleba last summer.",
      "Sadly, his performances this season do not merit such a high fee. So therein lies the problem for Wilcox and his recruitment team.",
      "Signing a player from the Premier League to replace Casemiro would be ideal. However, that will cost United big money and, currently, there is not one target who fits the mould well enough to constitute paying that money.",
      "United may need to go back to the drawing board and spread their net further afield.",

      "Manchester United exciting prospect James Overy has been handed a shock call-up to the Australia national team for this month's fixtures against Venezuela and Colombia.",
      "Socceroos boss Tony Popovic has named 11 inclusions to his squad, with United academy star Overy, who turns 18 this weekend, set to continue his rapid rise after impressing at the U20 World Cup.",
      "Overy moved to United in the summer of 2024 on a scholarship deal before he penned a professional contract in July. In May, Ruben Amorim included him and several youngsters in first-team training at Carrington ahead of the Premier League against Chelsea.",
      "Shortly after joining the Reds, Overy missed eight months due to injury before making his debut for the Under-18s in February. This season, he has been a regular in Darren Fletcher's team and has featured for the Under-21s in Premier League 2 and the National league Cup.",
      "Ahead of the upcoming international break, Overy will now look to make the next step in his career after being named in the Australia squad. Injuries to a number of regulars have led many players being called up by Popovic.",
      "\"It's another opportunity to expand the depth and introduce players who have not yet been exposed to the Socceroos environment or senior international football,\" Popovic said. \"We also welcome back some familiar faces, from Australia and abroad.",
      "\"I've had the chance to closely observe the opening rounds of the A-League season, and we believe this is the ideal time to integrate domestic players into the squad.",
      "\"We are delighted to be back in the United States to face strong South American opposition as we continue our preparations for the World Cup.\"",
      "Australia will play Venezuela in Houston on November 14 before taking on Colombia in New York. The international break is one of the final chances for players to make their mark ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The Socceroos have already secured their place in the summer tournament and will aim to progress past the round of 16 for the first time, having lost to Argentina in Qatar in 2022.",

      "His performances in Brazil have led to several clubs monitoring his progress, with a move in January being tipped. United and Chelsea have been labelled as the 'most interested' clubs in the race, with West Ham United also keen.",

      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Roque is a name that continues to be discussed on the transfer rumour mill and in an interview with Globo Esporte, the striker's agent has revealed that the player's entourage is expecting bids when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Relayed by Spanish website Sport, Andre Cury, one of the agents at Link Sports, said: \"We already had an offer from the Arab world for €35 million (£30.8m), which didn't interest us.",
      "\"Now we are waiting to receive a proposal of around €50 million from the Premier League. The plan was to come back here, recover his strength, and also explore the market. If a good offer comes in for everyone involved and they understand that he needs to leave, he's willing to listen, but he's very happy at Palmeiras.",

      "Out-on-loan Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is playing with a point to prove at Napoli following his summer transfer window move - according to one expert on the club.",
      "The Dane was not expected to depart this summer. However, when Benjamin Sesko pitched up at Old Trafford, Hojlund's position changed.",
      "If he were to leave, a permanent move was one which was preferred to provide Hojlund with stability. That was not forthcoming, but a loan to Napoli with an obligation to buy, was.",
      "Like Scott McTominay before him, Hojlund has enjoyed a positive start to life in Naples. The frontman has scored four goals in nine appearances and the confidence is clearly flowing once again.",
      "\"Napoli fans are pretty much everywhere in Italy when Hojlund arrived, Napoli did the medical tests in Rome and when he arrived, there were so many Napoli fans welcoming him,\" Bettoni said. \"Fans were pretty happy with the signing because what he showed in his season at Atalanta was pretty promising.",
      "\"Even if the time at Manchester United wasn't excellent for him, far from it, but they were pretty happy.\" The love of the Napoli fanbase will be one of the driving factors for the United recruits switching Old Trafford for the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.",
      "Bettoni believes that Hojlund may be gaining the inspiration from elsewhere, too. \"There is a factor in the player's mentality, as well,\" he continued.",
      "\"You can see by the way he plays that he has something personal to prove because clearly the last two seasons at Manchester United weren't very good. Knowing Conte, he would have talked about this with the player.",
      "\"It's an important task for Hojlund, because he needs to lead the attack while [Romelu] Lukaku is injured. So he has a personal point to prove as well, because he wants to show what kind of striker he is and I think the way Conte motivates the players it is one more reason why he looks so excited to play and is really willing to make an impact.\"",
      "Few would have predicted this summer that Hojlund would be assisted by Kevin De Bruyne during this campaign. But that is how it has played out for the forward as the pair joined forces to devastating effect in the victory over Sporting CP in the Champions League.",
      "Hojlund will likely have to do without De Bruyne until February due to injury and Bettoni has warned that the striker will need to adapt his style in the interim. \"On paper, we have not seen so much of Hojlund without De Bruyne so far,\" he concluded.",
      "\"Technically it will be more about holding the ball and a few less runs into the spaces, but this is just technically because in games when Napoli decide to sit deep and not press too high and not try to win the ball high up the pitch, they will need to counter-attack and Hojlund will be a very important player in this phase as well. Against other teams, without De Bruyne, Hojlund will need to be a lot more involved in the link-up and much more solid physically so that he can hold up the ball, link-up with the wingers and the central midfielders, as well.",
      "\"It will be a lot more about the link-up play and trying to work well with his teammates rather than just trying to make forward runs and runs into spaces.\"",

      "A year ago on Saturday, Ruben Amorim was announced as the new Manchester United manager, succeeding Erik ten Hag, who left under a cloud.",
      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Another significant challenge involved overhauling United's goalkeeping department. It quickly became apparent that David de Gea didn't align with Ten Hag's philosophy, whilst there was also a notable shortage of alternative options to provide adequate cover.",
      "In the summer of 2023, United brought in Andre Onana for £47.2million to replace De Gea. A further £4.3m was paid to sign Altay Bayindir from Fenerbahce, although both transfers have failed to work out.",
      "After a poor 2024/25 season, Onana was allowed to leave the club under Ruben Amorim last summer. The Cameroon international joined Trabzonspor on loan for the season and has earned plenty of praise.",

      "Under Ten Hag, before Onana and Bayindir's arrival, Mvogo was targeted by Ten Hag. The Swiss international had spent several years on loan at PSV Eindhoven when he received the opportunity to move to United during the summer of 2022.",

      "United chose to focus on defending corners rather than attacking them in their warm-up, and while neither Forest goal came from a corner, both came from crosses into the box and so United's pre-match drills clearly did very little to improve their ability to defend crosses into the box.",
      "More work is needed.",

      "Unsurprisingly he was an unused substitute at the City Ground.",
      "Neville targeted by chants",
      "On a couple of occasions United fans were reminded that Gary Neville is an unpopular figure at Forest. His comments about the owner Evangelos Marinakis last season saw him banned from co-commentary of Forest's Premier League finale against Chelsea.",

      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "An improvement on Dalot. 6",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has insisted that Manchester United were fortunate not to concede a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir would have struggled to believe his luck at the start of the Premier League campaign.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, Bayindir struggled for any minutes at all, with Andre Onana the clear first choice.",
      "After an injury picked up by Onana during the summer, Ruben Amorim chose to trust Bayindir with the gloves. The Cameroonian's poor performance at Grimsby Town, followed by his subsequent exit to Trabzonspor, appeared to have cemented Bayindir's place in the starting XI.",
      "And yet, after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his opportunity and he has not looked back. The Belgian has been impressive and the comparisons from the Stretford End to Peter Schmeichel are of course tongue in cheek but a sign of how good he has been.",
      "Bayindir is now back down the pecking order as second choice at Old Trafford and, with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, it would be no surprise if he seeks an exit. Amorim may be reluctant to allow him to leave without a replacement lined up, but would he really stop him leaving if a decent bid was tabled?",
      "If Bayindir goes in January, it would see Tom Heaton pushed into an unexpected new role as second choice goalkeeper, should a replacement not arrive in the mid-season window.",
      "If that happens, it would be a fitting half season for Heaton, especially when he is expected to retire at the end of the campaign. The 39-year-old has had a brilliant career, and to finish up back at United as a regular in the matchday squad would be a solid achievement.",
      "If Bayindir does choose to leave, Heaton may be handed a promotion.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov has issued a warning to Gary Neville as he has urged the Manchester United legend to go easier on summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko was among Man Utd’s summer signings as the Red Devils fended off competition from Arsenal and Newcastle United to sign him from RB Leipzig for around £74m.",
      "Man Utd settled on their preferred striker signing after missing out on Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap, who joined Arsenal and Chelsea respectively.",
      "22-year-old Sesko was eased into the team by Amorim following his move to Old Trafford and he has impressed in flashes, but Neville has been unimpressed with Man Utd’s new striker.",
      "Neville pointed the finger at Sesko after Man Utd’s 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest last weekend, claiming the “awkward” forward has been “well off it” this season.",
      "READ: The season so far in six tables: Arsenal power, Spurs and Man Utd silliness",
      "Now, Berbatov has hit back at Neville, who should be more “constructive” with his comments about Sesko.",
      "“Everybody can criticise via social media, on TV, and I don’t care how big a man you think you are, that tough criticism, repeated constantly, can get to you,” Berbatov said in an interview with The Metro.",
      "“It can affect your game, it can affect your mood, it can affect your confidence, because we’re all human beings.",
      "“Of course, I can easily criticise strikers, teams, players, coaches, etc. But we need to look for that criticism that is constructive, that is going to give you something extra, that you’re going to think about and say, ‘Well, wait a minute, he or she has a point’.",
      "“Of course, there are some ex-football players who earn the right, more than others, to criticise, and that’s why I think Gary Neville is in the frame to say and express more criticism based on his career at United, what he’s achieved, won, and how much time he spent there.",
      "“In my case, I think I try to give my opinion, but a constructive one, and try maybe to see more of the positive side of things, expressing what I expect from the players. Sesko has a slow start, but let’s hope he’s ready to jump and to bring the necessary goals that he’s required from the number nine at United.”",
      "Berbatov has also explained why he thinks Sesko “has everything”.",
      "“He has everything that a striker should have,” Berbatov claimed.",
      "“He’s tall, he’s athletic. Left, right foot, he scored some bangers in the Bundesliga, heading as well. But the Bundesliga is different from the Premier League. The Premier League is a completely different beast.",
      "“He is dependent, of course, on the service he gets from his players. And that’s why I say get to know your teammates, how your teammates are playing.”",
      "He added: “This is United, this is one of the biggest teams in the world. The pressure is always there, even when you sleep. The pressure is going to be there. So be patient. Sometimes the slow start means that you’re just ready to jump.”",

      "Key to the turnaround has been the form of revitalised midfielder Casemiro, and to a lesser extent Maguire in defence.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results. There are only five teams left unbeaten in the Champions League, and three of those are Arsenal, Man City and Spurs.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 12th, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",
      "Total points: 89.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",

But the big three should all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night warriors.",

      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently around the cut line at 24th and 26th.",

      "Spurs have struggled badly at home in the Premier League this season even though they’ve had United’s number in recent matches.",
      "In addition, United look far more convincing at home than away so don’t cry out to be backed either.",
      "Almost by default, the draw at 5/2 is probably the best bet.",
      "It’s likely to be a scoring draw and one standout to find the net is Bryan Mbeumo, who has wheeled away in celebration three times previously at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "The Cameroon international is worth a punt to score anytime at 2/1."

      "The Netherlands international cost Man Utd £36.5m with Zirkzee contributing six goal and two assists in 51 appearances in all competitions since joining.",
      "Only 21 of those appearances have come from the start of matches with Zirkzee being used as a substitute more often that not, especially this season.",

      "READ: Five fascinating insights as Man Utd chief Wilcox talks Harlem Globetrotters, Sesko and Amorim",
      "Gullit told The Metro: “I think from my point of view that he should have stayed in Italy, because he was really striving.",
      "“He was really doing well at Bologna, and I was hoping that he would go to Milan. I think that as soon as he went to Manchester United, it was the wrong decision.",

He remains professional and fully focused in training, and Ruben Amorim is happy with his attitude.",
      "“That said, interest is building. West Ham are looking for a striker and have Zirkzee on their shortlist, while Roma in Italy are also exploring the situation. Whether he moves will depend entirely on United’s approval for a loan deal. If given the green light, England and Italy are likely destinations.”",

      "Romano added: “Kobbie Mainoo wanted to go on loan late in the summer transfer window, but Manchester United and Ruben Amorim decided against it at the time. Mainoo is still not playing regularly, so he remains open to a six-month loan move in January, returning to United in the summer.",
      "“The final decision will depend on Manchester United’s plans – whether they bring in another midfielder, and on Amorim’s preference to maintain his current squad. There is interest from West Ham, offering guaranteed minutes, and from Napoli, who are looking for midfield cover after Kevin De Bruyne’s injury.”",

The fact that lock-the-game-down change precipitated the most astonishing five minutes of attacking football yet seen from Spurs in this deeply weird season again leaves us pondering just where Xavi stands in it all.",

But unless and until there’s some halfway compelling evidence of it against proper teams, he is going to face inevitable questions about the Bundesliga Tax and whether he’s quite cut out for Our League, and some of those questions will be reasonable and not just ones in ridiculous terms from ridiculous gobsh*tes like Jamie O’Hara.",

      "Milos Kerkez has been the real oddity among the potential flops from Liverpool’s summer business specifically because he looked the safest bet of the lot. He was the best left-back in the Premier League last season and there didn’t seem to be anything about either the defensive or attacking side of his game that indicated he was in any way unready or incapable of making the step up to an elite club.",

Sat out the best night of the season against Real Madrid altogether, and we’ve grown increasingly obsessed by the way Virgil van Dijk looks at him with something approaching shit-on-his-shoe disgust after every single defensive travesty that has befallen Liverpool this season.

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has made an appearance on a new podcast series for the Red Devils’ official website called ‘Inside Carrington’.",
      "Wilcox has gone from complete silence to two interviews in a week after the tide has turned in a positive direction for Man Utd over the past month.",
      "Ruben Amorim won his first back-to-back games since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago and those two wins turned into three when they beat Brighton 4-2 late last month.",
      "A 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest at the weekend would have been a great result last season and it was important this campaign in order to keep Amorim’s unbeaten run going.",
      "Confidence is slowly building at Old Trafford with Man Utd supporters no longer looking ahead to matches with trepidation.",
      "A few good results on the bounce has already seen Wilcox pat himself on the back and now he has had a deep dive into various subjects to do with the club.",
      "Here are five of his most fascinating insights from the ‘Inside Carrington’ interview…",
      "",
      "Wilcox said: “It is not about putting the Harlem Globetrotters together. If I look at successful Man United teams, there were very functional players that would die for the badge and there were some mavericks.”",
      "On what the Red Devils are looking for, the Man Utd director of football added: “Last year’s summer window [2024] was a lot more chaotic than this one and this one was really calm. With this one, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "“These are continuous meetings with myself and Ruben [Amorim], with Chris Vivell and with his team underneath, where we are very clear on the profiles that we need. So, the brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris, there is a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles that we need, and then the scouts will go into the market, we will combine that with the data team and then there will just be constant dialogue.",
      "“Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable, with Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach. When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process. The data team are involved in the process and we will then focus all our attention on certain players.”",
      "“It is really important then that we do the background checks on whether they are clean-living professionals. This is really important. This year, we looked at Premier League-ready players and certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area. We needed players that we could plug in and play, with little transition time.”",
      "",
      "“Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers that have got huge potential. Senne was available and we decided to move, but it wasn’t a kneejerk reaction. Tony Coton was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it. This guy is going to be a top signing for us and he has started well, but he has got to keep it going. He is very reflective and he is very professional with his approach.”",
      "",
      "“Benji, at the top end, he’s going to be an amazing player. It’s difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus and Bryan as well.",
      "“All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.”",
      "",
      "“We’ve just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things. But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",
      "",
      "“All we are doing now is making sure that we make decisions for the football club and not for the benefit, not for the short-term protection of ourselves, we’re making some really bold decisions for the future of Man United.",
      "“Man United is bigger than any player, any manager, any staff member. We are custodians, if you like, and we’ve just got to understand that at some point our journey will end, inevitably.",
      "“We need to make sure that when we leave this football club, whenever that is, and I hope I am here for a long, long time, that this football club is in a much better position.”",
      "Ruben Amorim wants to retain the services of a key Man Utd pair he’s ‘really happy’ with beyond the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Amorim admits Man Utd have “made a lot of mistakes” but insists his side are “improving” after criticism from Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match."

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are intensifying their pursuit of Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, viewing him as a prime and realistic target for the January transfer window, and TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped.",
      "Sources close to Man Utd indicate that the Red Devils are confident of securing a deal, despite Forest’s firm stance on demanding a substantial fee.",
      "Anderson, the 22-year-old England star who joined Forest from Newcastle United in a £35million deal last summer, has quickly established himself as a key player at the City Ground.",
      "His energetic displays in midfield have caught the eye of United’s boss, Ruben Amorim, who sources say is desperate to inject more dynamism and legs into his engine room.",
      "With the team getting better but struggling for consistency in the Premier League, Amorim sees Anderson’s relentless work rate, pressing ability, and box-to-box stamina as the perfect fit for his high-intensity system.",
      "Another key attribute wooing higher-ups at Man Utd is Anderson’s ability to break the lines with his pinpoint passing.",
      "Such a trait meshes well with Amorim’s attacking philosophy which prioritises faster-paced attacks over more measured and deliberate build-ups.",
      "United’s belief in landing Anderson stems from multiple factors.",
      "Club insiders reveal that the player himself would be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, attracted by the opportunity to compete at the highest level and the chance to immerse himself in the prestige of a ‘big six’ club.",
      "This mutual interest could prove pivotal in negotiations, especially as United scout the market for affordable reinforcements amid financial fair play constraints.",
      "However, Nottingham Forest have drawn a clear line in the sand: pay big money or back off.",
      "Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",
      "As such, we understand Forest are setting their stall out around the £80m mark, though United believe a deal can be struck for closer to £60m.",
      "Anderson’s contributions have been perhaps the brightest spark at the City Ground this term in what has otherwise been a season of doom and gloom for the 19th-placed side so far.",
      "Forest are well aware losing Anderson would have a detrimental effect on their ability to stave off relegation, thus ensuring they’ll put up stiff resistance if Man Utd do act on their interest and thunder in with a significant bid.",
      "Amorim’s tactical blueprint demands midfielders who can cover ground relentlessly, and Anderson’s profile aligns perfectly.",
      "Amorim operates with a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro the most selected midfield pairing in between the wing-backs this season.",
      "Given the wing-backs are tasked with controlling an entire flank by themselves, United’s two-man midfield can often be exposed against teams who deploy three in the middle. This is just one of the reasons why a relentless engine is such a valued trait for Amorim when the Portuguese signs midfielders.",
      "United’s hierarchy shares Amorim’s adoration of the player, along with his optimism a deal CAN be made in the winter window.",
      "Accordingly, sources state the club are prepared to test Forest’s resolve with a structured offer that would total a figure around £60m.",
      "As the January window approaches, this saga could define United’s mid-season revival. Will Forest hold firm, or will Anderson’s ambition propel him to Manchester? The coming weeks will tell.",
      "In other news, TEAMtalk can reveal the primary reason why United have abandoned their attempts to sign Endrick on loan in January.",
      "Elsewhere, Man Utd have been savaged for offloading a player who is now ‘unstoppable’.",
      "Finally, a report has detailed the ‘dilemma’ Ruben Amorim faces with a Man Utd star he can’t live with but can’t live without.",

      "Former Man Utd winger Lee Sharpe insists that the Red Devils should look to upgrade Diogo Dalot with the defender “sloppy in his decision-making”.",
      "Man Utd have won three and drawn one of their last four Premier League matches as pressure on Ruben Amorim has almost completely eased.",
      "Despite a set of great of results, there are still some areas that are concerning Man Utd fans and former players with Sharpe insisting they need an upgrade on right-back Dalot.",
      "Speaking to Adventure Gamers, Sharpe said: “Both Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu have struggled at left wing-back for Manchester United this season.",
      "“I’ve always thought Dalot is a bit sloppy in his decision-making at times – he gives the ball away cheaply and gets caught out of position defensively. I also don’t think he gets close enough to wingers when they’re crossing the ball, so there’s a few things in his game that I feel need improving.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "“I think it’s an area Man United would want to look at in January or next summer. Dorgu looks like he could become quite a good player, but he’s had a couple of injuries and is a bit inconsistent with his form, so he’s not quite ready to be relied on just yet.”",
      "Man Utd spent over £200m on new signings in the summer transfer window with Bryan Mbeumo arriving as one of five new signings.",
      "The Cameroon international has adapted better than any of the summer signings with five goals in 11 matches in all competitions, including three in their last three matches.",
      "On Mbeumo, Sharpe added: “Bryan Mbeumo has been absolutely fantastic this season. It’s not just his ability to create chances and score goals, but his awareness of what’s going on in the game is what has particularly impressed me.",
      "“He’s always involved the game in some way – he never switches off, and you can tell that he was previous Premier League experience. His work rate is phenomenal as well – he’s always looking to run into gaps and create space for others.",
      "“For me, he’s right up there with the best wingers in the Premier League at the moment. He’s scoring goals and creating chances, and his stats stack up as some of the best in the division currently.”",
      "Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson has been linked heavily with a move to Old Trafford in January with Man Utd looking to upgrade their midfield.",
      "And now journalist Andy Mitten insists Man Utd are “well-positioned” to land the Premier League midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Mitten said on The Talk of the Devils podcast: “Elliot Anderson is the one who would be well-positioned at the moment for Man Utd. I’m choosing my words extremely carefully.",
      "“I start to go through the team and right, that midfield is going to change in the next few years.”",
      "TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson from Manchester United in January.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are hoping to complete an audacious double deal in January as they target Elliot Anderson and Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "Crystal Palace, Everton and West Ham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in ...",
      "Man Utd could be set to splash out on two big signings in the January transfer window after Ruben Amorim’s side’s recent good form, according to reports.",
      "A pundit has explained why Manchester United should avoid signing Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, with it argued that the Red Devils “don’t need” him."

      "Didi Hamann insists Man Utd striker Benjamin Sesko has “impressed” him “more than” new Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "The Red Devils invested £74m in Sesko as the Slovenia international arrived at Old Trafford in the summer from RB Leipzig after scoring 39 goals in 87 appearances for the Bundesliga club.",
      "The 22-year-old has scored just two goals in 11 matches in all competitions since moving to Man Utd and has faced criticism in recent weeks.",
      "Gary Neville insisted that Sesko looked “awkward” as Man Utd drew 2-2 against Nottingham Forest at the weekend and insists the “jury is out” on the striker still.",
      "Neville said: “I’m no further forward with him. The jury is out.",
      "“He’s well off it compared to the other summer signings that Man United made up front in [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "“He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half when balls got played over the top and his touch wasn’t quite right.",
      "“For 80 million pound, you can say he’s young, has a lot of potential and is only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.”",
      "But former Liverpool midfielder Hamann insists that Sesko and Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade have been more impressive this season than Arsenal striker Gyokeres, who has scored six goals in 13 matches so far.",
      "When asked which player out of Sesko, Gyokeres and Woltemade will score the most goals this season, Hamann told footballblog.co.uk: ‘I think the club that will be creating the most chances will be Arsenal, and so that probably puts Gyokeres ahead of the other two, Woltemade and Sesko.",
      "“Of the three players, I think that Sesko and Woltemade have impressed me more than Gyokeres.",
      "“If Woltemade is the regular penalty taker for Newcastle from now until the end of the season, then I think I will put Woltemade down as the player to score the most out of those three this season.",
      "“I think Sesko found it hard at first because it’s a different game in England compared to Germany. But he’s a very talented player.",
      "“He was always very confident and he’s got a lot of belief in his ability. But then when you come to a club where things are not great, it’s difficult for a striker.",
      "“Confidence is a big thing, and poor morale at a club doesn’t help. I think he’s done okay so far, but we certainly haven’t seen the best yet because he’s an exceptional talent.",
      "“People in Salzburg said at 16, 17, when he came to the club, he was better than Erling Haaland. Obviously that’s not the case at the moment, but I think potentially he could be a player who scores 20, 25 goals every season.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Unlikely. Kylian Mbappe is 14 ahead of the Arsenal man.",

      "It is, frankly, a perfect storm of interlull dullness, as you can see from our quick Interlull Dullness Survey here.",
      "Is it the November international break, the third in quick succession and thus by definition always the hardest to drag yourself through? Yes.",
      "Are England’s games entirely meaningless? You bet your Anglo-centric arse and anus England’s games are entirely meaningless.",

      "It’s going to be just awful. There is probably nothing that can be done to save it or us, but here are five things that we desperately now want to happen over the days ahead in the forlorn hope it might at least mitigate the barrenness of the wasteland stretching out before us.",
      "",
      "Famously something that Tottenham don’t really do anymore, their four wins against Manchester United last season even going so far as the truly absurd lengths of delivering a trophy to N17, but a lot has changed in the weeks and months since That Night in Bilbao.",
      "Man United’s recovery from deepest and darkest crisis still hasn’t been enough to get that lad a haircut after the 2-2 draw at Forest, but it’s still delivered 10 points in four games and that will very much do. And Liverpool’s win over Villa last week has taken the edge off slightly at Anfield.",
      "It’s going to be hard to concoct a full crisis for any of the Big Six now, but our best bet might be Thomas Frank over at Spurs after the most small-time ‘big club’ home performance in living memory against Chelsea. The initial plan appeared to be to play for a goalless draw and then, when that didn’t work out, play for a 1-0 defeat. It’s a mad plan for Spurs at home to absolutely anyone, but especially a Chelsea side that absolutely isn’t all that having lost to Sunderland the previous weekend and then nearly contrived all sorts of unpleasantness at desperate Wolves in the Carabao.",
      "Frank absolutely needs a result and a performance against United to silence some of the increasingly loud doubts and also at least start to turn around that laughably poor home form, albeit only some of which – but an inevitably increasing amount – has come on his watch.",
      "Lose to United for the first time in over three years, and Spurs will drop back into mid-table where, frankly, their performances deserve to have them. Do it in anything like a repeat of the drab, ambition-free nature of the Chelsea defeat and suddenly there’s a story to fill the void and an awkward couple of weeks for Frank before the blessed relief of another away game. Which is at Arsenal. Oof.",
      "",
      "Not sure City can be plunged easily back into crisis, but we’re damn sure Liverpool can. Nothing about the way a team that has conceded 14 goals already in the Premier League this season has gone about their defending suggests they are in any way ready to cope with Erling Haaland in his current preposterous pomp, so there really is every chance for a silly high-scoring game here that does much to sustain us through the days and nights that follow.",
      "Is a wild 5-3 in the last Premier League game for 13 days really too much to ask? We say no. No it is not. More defensive calamity. More Virgil van Dijk looking daggers at Milos Kerkez and wondering how it’s all come to this. More Haaland doing the robot.",
      "While we’re being greedy, we’ll take a Salah hat-trick at the other end as well, please. We just want a Super Sunday headliner that legitimately has enough going on to fill the next three days’ discourse. We won’t ask for anything ever again. Not until March anyway.",
      "We will grudgingly accept the reverse outcome – as we would with Spurs-United, to be fair – if it’s large and compelling and above all funny enough. But it really does feel like Spurs and Liverpool are our best crisis bets this weekend, the sheer futility of trying to predict what Chelsea might get up to having now been firmly established.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Wolves bottom, Liverpool being sh*t and other inevitable things we should have seen coming",
      "",
      "Perhaps the greediest and unlikeliest request of the lot, but the less ridiculously we are able to spend the interlull kidding ourselves on that there might still be a title race, the better.",
      "It’s another factor, really, in why City beating Liverpool is better than the other way round, because City are currently that precious one point closer to the runaway leaders, which means any result other than a City win just means that Arsenal lead getting bigger again.",
      "Unless, and hear us out because it is technically possible, Arsenal don’t beat Sunderland. These lads are fourth in the league, after all. We really shouldn’t just be assuming Arsenal definitely beat them, even though assuming Arsenal definitely beat pretty much anyone feels entirely fair at this point what with the twin superpowers of never facing any shots on their own goal and always scoring at least one p*ss-boiling set-piece at the other.",
      "But maybe the chaotic and unexpected energy of Sunderland is just the thing to derail the serene Mikel Arteta machine. And for our own something-to-fill-the-void requirements, the greater the prominence of Granit Xhaka in any such spanner-in-the-works behaviour the better.",
      "",
      "The fixture computer has deigned in her infinite wisdom and great mischievous magnificence to grant us not just two Big Six encounters upon this sacred final weekend before another bastard break, but also at least two relegation six-pointers. We thank her and make offerings to her glory.",

      "We don’t care who steps up to heroically take the fall, we just need one of you four to get absolutely battered to keep the Sack Race nice and lively for the next 10 days. Please and thank you.",
      "",
      "We’ve thought long and hard about this one. In truth, there is absolutely no universe now where this international break isn’t Bellingham Week. No timeline where Mediawatch isn’t sighing and repeating itself from the last international break, which was literally five f*cking minutes ago.",
      "There’s no avoiding it, all we can hope to do is to mitigate the extent of the nonsense. And we reckon the best chance is if Tuchel does pick him this time.",
      "Because if Bellingham is in the squad, at least the Bellingham Week stories that follow will have to make some kind of superficial nod to real-world events that actually happen rather than the press pack having completely free rein to just make up the narrative.",
      "Which brings us to the further mitigating requirements required here to try and damp down the crazy. First, Bellingham will need to play some part in the games and be quite good but not too good. If he’s conspicuously good or conspicuously bad, it’s all too easy for it to naturally become the dominant narrative anyway. Bellingham isn’t really a footballer who does ‘quietly effective’ but we are really going to need him to try.",
      "And if that can happen with the barest minimum of any accompanying behaviour that can be spun as Billy Big Bollocks antics, again it would really help.",
      "Obviously, there’s no actual proper solution here. Anything he does (or doesn’t do) will still constitute a display of true colours or the speaking of volumes but the more egregiously the media has to reach for it the better. Don’t be giving them any ammunition.",

      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has named four Red Devils players who “should be doing a lot better” for Ruben Amorim despite their age.",
      "After an inconsistent start to the season, which mirrored much of their form from the previous campaign, Man Utd seem to have potentially turned a corner under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have won three and drawn one of their last four Premier League matches as they have moved up the table into eighth and one point behind defending champions Liverpool, who occupy third position.",
      "Following some encouraging performances and results, Man Utd can now look ahead to the January transfer window and potentially continuing a rebuild under Amorim, who was rumoured to be on the verge of being sacked in early October.",
      "Despite their recent good form, Neville still reckons four players “should be doing a lot better” to hold the Man Utd team together.",
      "Neville told The Overlap and Betfair’s Stick to Cricket show: “I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man United, our spine was (Peter) Schmeichel, (Steve) Bruce, (Gary) Pallister, (Roy) Keane and (Eric) Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",

      "“De Ligt’s played a mountain of games at sort of different levels, the highest level. Harry’s played so many times for England. You’ve got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno have got massive experience.",
      "“Up front, they haven’t got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "“That’s why I think Liverpool are good because they’ve got Alisson, (Virgil) van Dijk, they’ve got (Alexis) Mac Allister and (Ryan) Gravenberch in midfield and then they’ve got obviously the centre-forwards that they’ve got.”",
      "A report came out in The Athletic which claimed Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi were the two prime candidates, alongside Amorim, to take over at Old Trafford before the Portuguese head coach was appointed.",
      "When asked for his thoughts on his YouTube channel, Rio Ferdinand said: “Who cares?",
      "“We’re in the moment where Amorim is starting to find a bit of positivity, and then we’re writing about someone who could have or should have taken the job over a year ago.",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",

      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",

      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 21:57, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and explains why Arsenal's winning streak will be under threat at Sunderland.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium should be a fortress - a new-build modern footballing arena full of intimidation. But right now it feels more like a luxury spa for visiting teams.",
      "Opponents don't turn up dreading it. They turn up enjoying it. It's football's version of checking into a five-star hotel. You get pampered, you play your game and more often than not, you leave with something to show for it.",
      "That's seen in Spurs' home record of late. In the last year, Spurs have the fewest points (13), fewest wins (3) and most defeats (12) at home than any other ever-present side and have kept just three clean sheets in the last 39 Premier League games at home.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are box office again. Not in the relentless, ruthless, title-challenging way of Sir Alex Ferguson's juggernaut but in the sense that you simply can't take your eyes off them.",
      "United aren't ready to challenge for honours yet. They are a team built for moments - not for consistency, meaning they can't be trusted still as a betting proposition in the win market where they are favourites here at 29/20 with Sky Bet. The greater value is found in their total goals line where the 10/11 for them to score over 1.5 goals rates as nice wager - something which has landed in seven of their last nine games.",
      "Jack Grealish and card-based plays are very much a profitable theme of this season. Grealish remains the most fouled player in the Premier League having been fouled 29 times. He's drawing cards from these fouls too with Trai Hume, Daniel Munoz, Matty Cash and Mads Wieffer all being booked for challenges on Grealish.",
      "Opponents are doubling up and generally spending 90 minutes trying to test his patience as much as his skill. When he doesn't get the decisions, the petulance tends to bubble up, which also makes Grealish a underrated player in the to be carded market himself.",
      "Grealish doesn't lose his head often, but when he does, it's usually in games exactly like this against a physical side who are happy to foul, frustrate and use game management techniques. It's 12/1 with Sky Bet for both Grealish's direct opponent Kenny Tete and Grealish to be carded.",
      "Keep an eye on Crysencio Summerville if you're looking to grab some value in the coming weeks.",
      "Because under Nuno Espirito Santo's new counter-attacking West Ham, the Dutchman looks built to be the headline act in the attacking prop markets. Nuno's blueprint took shape in their win over Newcastle: sit deep, soak up and strike. It's the same model that brought him success at Wolves and Nottingham Forest where defensive structure, lightning transitions and wide players given license to explode into space are to the fore.",
      "And that's where Summerville fits perfectly. He's been bubbling nicely under the radar with his performances for West Ham but could be about to take centre stage in this system based on his showing against Newcastle. He had three shots, one on target and a first goal of the season isn't far away. It may come here with 3/1 with Sky Bet standing out.",
      "Remember, football is defined by fine margins and is a very low-scoring sport.",
      "No matter how good of a team you are, a bit of variance and misfortune is going to hit you at some point. Arsenal are a fantastic team, keeping eight clean sheets in a row and winning the last 10 - it's incredible stuff but this isn't an unbeatable outfit. They have flaws.",
      "The outcomes in football are too volatile to allow perfection to persist.",
      "And when it comes to betting on football, the shrewdest of gamblers out there understand this and instead of chasing the streak, they are looking for opportunities for when it snaps.",
      "And at the prices here I want to be with Sunderland to end the Arsenal streak at the prices on offer.",
      "Sunderland are a fiercely organised side who are defensively secure. Robin Roefs has commanded his box very efficiently in goal to the extent that Sunderland have the second-best record in the Premier League when it comes to goals conceded from set-pieces. Arsenal can be very difficult to stop from such scenarios but Sunderland look well placed to deal with the set-piece machine.",
      "This is the time to be brave, sail against the market and get ahead of the 'bad day at the office for Arsenal' curve where all their streaks end.",
      "My main play is to back both teams to score at 6/5 with Sky Bet with eyes also on Sunderland to win at 7/1 and Sunderland to win to nil at 12/1.",
      "A nervous referee is a card-happy referee. We have an inexperienced one in charge here with Andrew Kitchen overseeing just his fourth Premier League game. This is the biggest and highest profile one he's been assigned to.",
      "With these inexperienced referees the pressure of refereeing by the law, not the spirit of the game, often takes over when the Premier League microscope zooms in. A tactical foul that in the Championship might have been managed with a word suddenly becomes a nailed-on booking in the Premier League.",
      "And Chelsea are just crazy for cards since the start of last season. Their games are averaging 4.9 yellows per game in that period - that's the highest of any team. Furthermore, this fixture does have lots of spice attached to it with the last six averaging 6.9 total cards per game, including the most recent Carabao Cup tie which saw nine yellows and a red shown.",
      "I'm very keen on backing the cards line with 11/10 with Sky Bet on offer for over 4.5 cards shown.",
      "Bournemouth will be rested, organised and fully revved under Andoni Iraola - and will surely fancy their chances of turning over an Aston Villa side running on European fumes. The Premier League calendar hasn't been kind to Aston Villa - facing Iraola's team after a midweek game is a brutal examination.",
      "Thursday nights in Europe are still glamorous but they take a toll. For all of Unai Emery's tactical acumen, his squad isn't yet deep enough to juggle the workload without something giving.",
      "Bournemouth have had a full week to prepare, to rest legs and to fine tune a high-tempo, front-foot plan under Iraola. They're one of the league's fittest sides, pressing with purpose and breaking with pace. All this hasn't been factored into the match prices enough so the Cherries look a nice price on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle were \"unrecognisable\" according to their boss Eddie Howe in their 3-1 defeat to West Ham. The lack of intensity and attacking threat felt very un-Newcastle-like.",
      "Just a one-off then? No, it's not.",
      "Having looked a little deeper, these underwhelming displays and results away from St James' Park are an issue under Howe.",
      "At home Newcastle feel empowered - they press, they go at you and they look expansive and confident. On the road it's different. They're more cautious and Howe has struggled to find a formula that allows them to flourish away from the magic of St James' Park.",
      "The defeat at the London Stadium means Newcastle are now eight league games without a win on the road stretching across the summer. Jacob Murphy's strike on Sunday was also just their fourth goal scored across those eight matches and their expected goals data across that winless run is trending at a paltry 1.2 per 90. Horrendous numbers.",
      "Therefore, it's very surprising to see them chalked up as favourites to win at Brentford with the home side available at Evens on the draw no bet.",
      "Writing about Danny Welbeck being in the form of his life in 2025 was not on my radar - but here we are.",
      "The Brighton front man is purring with confidence, looking sharper, hungrier and crucially for punters, more productive than ever. He's clocked up six goal involvements in his last six appearances, and if you zoom in on his recent minutes against Palace, it's even more impressive: three goal involvements in his last 150 minutes.",
      "These aren't streaky stats, they're signs of a player who's thriving in Fabian Hurzeler's fluid attacking structure. So, at 7/4 with Sky Bet for a goal or an assist? That's value.",
      "Sean Dyche is certainly getting to work. His fingerprints are already all over Forest's recent performances. There's been a higher ratio of long passes, more pressures in the final third and already the quality of chances Forest are facing is much lower than when under the gaze of Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Dyche is doing the sensible thing and making Forest much harder to score against.",
      "It's that defensive improvement shown under Dyche and Leeds' flakiness in attack that makes a Forest clean sheet easy to fancy here. They are actually 18 Premier League games without one - the club's worst run since 1960. And Dyche will be losing sleep over something like that.",
      "If you look back at Dyche's last 18 games as a manager, 15 of those landed for punters backing 'no' in the both teams to score market.",
      "It's 10/11 with Sky Bet to go in again.",
      "For punters eyeing up the first goalscorer market this weekend with Erling Haaland in their sights, it's worth asking whether the Norwegian's price truly stacks up at 3/1 with Sky Bet. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.",
      "The bookies dangle Haaland up at skinny odds and the rest of City's attacking talent gets priced as if they're supporting actors. That might make sense when City are bullying lesser sides but Liverpool are not that. And against Virgil van Dijk, Haaland's aura tends to dim.",
      "The goalscoring machine has malfunctioned when faced with Van Dijk, scoring just two goals in seven appearances for club and country.",
      "When Haaland can't dominate physically, City often find joy elsewhere and that's where the value creeps in.",
      "Step forward Phil Foden, who is back to his best and brimming with confidence.",
      "From October onwards in the 23/24 season, Foden was one of the hottest players on the planet, scoring 25 goals in all competitions during that period - a ratio of 0.7 goals per 90. His two goals in midweek pointed towards a return of those numbers which makes his 7/1 with Sky Bet quotes for the first goal look rather generous in a game that looks so difficult to call from an outright perspective.",

After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Amadou Onana grabs Alexis Mac Allister by the throat in the penalty area while attacking a corner - why just a yellow?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I thought it was a goal. I've seen refs take a much different approach. It's not a good punch. I don't think the forward does much wrong.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If you look at Donnarumma, it looks like it's not affecting him that much.",
      "\"When you look at all the players in the box, they're all nudging each other. There is contact. There is, you know, how many people are in the box? There are 20 players in there, so I don't understand why keepers want more protection.",
      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",
      "\"Brooks has definitely not fouled him. The referees have been consistent about this, and I think it's been good.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Rodrigo Bentancur avoids red for a tough challenge on Reece James.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think this is one of them. If he gets sent off, VAR is not bringing him back. I think it's more red than a yellow card.",
      "\"But I can understand the yellow on field. I think VAR is going to back the decision.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",
      "\"You cannot say every time that you touch the ball it is not a penalty. He blocked Bowen from getting to the ball, so it is a penalty!\"",
      "The decision took over three minutes - was that too long?",

      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",
