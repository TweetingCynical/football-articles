      "David Beckham has revealed a surprise financial boost amid suggestions he could front a Manchester United takeover. Since Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stirred the pot by suggesting new investment was imminent at Old Trafford, other reports have suggested an unnamed consortium from the UAE is gearing up to make an offer for the Glazers’ shareholding in the club.",
      "It is claimed the group wants Beckham, who boasts a net worth of around £300million, to be involved in the bid, although as an ambassador rather than a benefactor. Beckham's earnings have soared since he retired from playing, thanks to various commercial deals and savvy investments.",
      "He is also a part-owner of MLS side Inter Miami and League Two club Salford City, whose primary ownership group includes his best mate, Gary Neville. During a recent visit to Salford, Beckham revealed to Neville a financial boost he had recently uncovered.",
      "Speaking to Neville as they toured the city as part of a club documentary series, Beckham said: “Do you remember our pensions? I forgot I had a pension.\"",
      "Neville then quipped: \"That’s when you know you’ve got a lot of money, when you forget you’ve got a pension!\" Beckham went on: \"I found my pension, it’s gone up quite a lot.\"",
      "Neville, now a successful businessman, then recalled a pension-related blow he once suffered. He said: \"My PFA pension, there was a maximum cap you could put in. Do you remember that? I got to the cap and moved my pension money into another pension so I could buy commercial property. Lost everything.\"",
      "As Beckham chuckled, Neville laughed: \"It’s not funny!\" When Neville was asked if he had always been a good businessman, Beckham interjected: \"Obviously not!\"",
      "Neville added: \"That’s probably the one big mistake that I’ve made. But your pension should be the safest thing in the world.\"",
      "Beckham’s pension pot discovery is unlikely to make a dent in any United takeover bid, with the Glazers believed to want in the region of £5billion for the club. The unpopular American owners have taken a backseat since Sir Radcliffe’s Ineos Group bought a 27.7 per cent stake and assumed control of football operations.",
      "But the team hasn’t moved forward under Ratcliffe’s watch, while controversial mass cuts have been made off the pitch, leading to frustrated United fans demanding a change of direction.",
      "But despite Al-Sheikh’s eyebrow-raising declaration, club insiders have been left surprised by the recent takeover talk, while Radcliffe made no reference to fresh investment during a wide-ranging interview earlier this month.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has supported Jadon Sancho after the Aston Villa loanee made his comeback following a spell on the sidelines with illness. The winger was handed a starting berth for Villa in their Europa League clash with Go Ahead Eagles on Thursday night.",
      "That appearance marked his first outing since their opening fixture of the competition's league phase at home to Bologna in late September. He sat on the bench unused for their subsequent Premier League encounter with Fulham.",

      "Manchester United's unsuccessful pursuit of Carlos Baleba continues to loom large as they prepare to face Brighton on Saturday. Despite their best efforts, the Red Devils were unable to secure a central midfielder during the transfer window, with Baleba being a key target throughout the summer.",
      "Brighton stood firm in their stance that the 21-year-old star was not for sale, even going so far as to slap a whopping £115million price tag on the Cameroon international - a fee they had previously received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "While United may have other targets in mind, their interest in Baleba has not completely waned. The player is contracted until 2028, but there is speculation that a move to Old Trafford could be on the cards in the near future with Baleba believed to be open to joining United, while Bryan Mbeumo is also rumoured to be helping out.",
      "The midfielder remains on United's radar heading into 2026. Club officials were also reportedly delighted to discover that the Brighton star was open to a move last summer, despite the absence of European football this season.",
      "Brighton supremo Tony Bloom brutally dismissed suggestions that United's pursuit of Carlos Baleba constituted a \"saga\" whatsoever.",
      "The Seagulls chief provided a glimpse into the discussions and insisted that United swiftly abandoned their interest once told that the midfielder was not for sale.",
      "In conversation with The Argus, he said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "\"So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "Sources indicate that Mbeumo has been acting as an unofficial recruiter while representing Cameroon on the international stage, reportedly attempting to persuade Baleba to link up with him at Old Trafford.",
      "Both players were representing Cameroon during the most recent international fixtures. According to the Sun, Mbeumo seized the chance to discuss Baleba's prospects with the youngster.",
      "The publication suggests that the United attacker has even adopted a 'big brother' role with the 21-year-old. Nevertheless, it is understood that any potential move is more probable next summer rather than during the forthcoming January transfer window.",
      "It could be argued that the collapse of his proposed transfer has impacted Baleba's form during the opening months of the campaign. Yet the young midfielder insists he has rediscovered his peak performance levels ahead of Brighton's showdown with United.",
      "Following the Seagulls' victory over Newcastle on Saturday, Baleba celebrated with a social media post. Alongside several images from the match, he wrote: \"Good team win and I'm feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "In a fascinating twist, United star Leny Yoro showed his approval by liking the post. Baleba endured a difficult beginning to the campaign, with Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler openly demanding better displays from the player.",
      "Speaking before the Magpies fixture, the Brighton manager insisted Baleba must focus on his duties whilst he remains at the club. \"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton,\" he said.",
      "\"No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.\"",
      "While United monitor the situation, they have received a stark warning that Chelsea might make their move for Baleba. Ex-Aston Villa forward Gabby Agbonlahor even posted on social media, fuelling speculation.",
      "He said: \"Imagine him [Carlos Baleba] at Chelsea, imagine a midfield of Baleba, Caicedo and Fernandez, oh my god.\" Chelsea boast an extensive track record of prising players away from the Seagulls, to put it mildly.",
      "Over the past few years, Joao Pedro, Robert Sanchez, Caicedo and Marc Cucurella have all swapped the Amex Stadium for west London.",
      "The Blues even managed to lure former manager Graham Potter away from the South Coast club, although it's best not to dwell on how that move panned out.",

      "There's a school of thought that a win over Brighton this weekend will be more telling of progress for Manchester United than their shock victory over Liverpool. The success over the Reds is the biggest result of Ruben Amorim's tenure with the Red Devils but the club still have more to prove.",
      "The Portuguese coach has managed to find some positive results in matches against the Premier League's traditional powerhouses. Since arriving at the club last November, he has recorded three wins, three draws and five defeats against Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "There has been success too, against newly-promoted teams. United have managed five wins and one draw in six games under Amorim despite the side's struggles. But United have come unstuck against the divisions' remaining teams: the Red Devils have just three wins and three draws in 18 games, falling to defeat 12 times.",
      "Amorim has already tasted defeat against Brighton, in January, where Bruno Fernandes' penalty was in vain as Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter all got on the scoresheet at Old Trafford",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "In fact, United have not beaten the Seagulls at home since February 2022. Ralf Rangnick and Graham Potter were in charge of the teams as Cristiano Ronaldo and Fernandes secured a win.",
      "United have tasted three consecutive Old Trafford defeats against sides led by Potter, Roberto De Zerbi and Fabian Hurzeler. Amorim will hope he can change that and record a third win on the bounce for the first time in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Significant cash has been splashed since United last beat Brighton at home. The club have handed out more than £800million for new signings over that period and seen the likes of Antony, Antony, Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee arrive at the club before landing Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "Brighton have also made some big deals, most notably in their sales. Paul Barber has raked in around £450m, with Chelsea offering around £300m of that, with figures such as Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo, Joao Pedro, Billy Gilmour, and Alexis Mac Allister all departing.",
      "Where does that leave the team currently? After eight matches, they are side by side in the table with a single point between them. The Segulls have recorded one win and one defeat fewer than their opponents this weekend.",
      "Perhaps that means a draw is the most likely outcome. Alan Shearer believes so with both teams coming into the clash off of a win.",
      "\"This is a tough one to call,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"Last weekend, Man Utd had an amazing result at Liverpool with Brighton deservedly beating Newcastle.",
      "\"Brighton are a good team, they create chances and look very well organised. I'm going to go for a draw on this one. It might not be a bad result for both clubs.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has admitted he's been \"a bit surprised\" by the impact goalkeeper Senne Lammens has had since his debut.",
      "Lammens first showed his mettle against Sunderland before the October international break, and then followed up with another sterling performance against Liverpool.",
      "The 23-year-old's long goal kicks proved to be a game-changer in both of those United victories. He also made a crucial save to deny Alexander Isak during the first half at Anfield, earning him praise post-match.",
      "When quizzed at Carrington on Friday about whether Lammens' impact had taken him aback, Amorim confessed: \"I think a little bit because it's hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he's not a young kid but he's still young,\".",
      "Amorim further discussed the team's direct approach, adding: \"I think you can see [progress] if you watch all the games. That game was different. If you have to point at a team who can control games with the ball, it is City or against Arsenal at the end of the game. Every team has to adapt and we adapt.",
      "\"We struggled to have long possessions against Liverpool, but if you go to the Arsenal game, it was completely different. Sometimes it is the environment, which is the first part we miss.",
      "\"Some players who are in different positions, who can give us more direct play than playing with the ball. We want to play a different style. Our style is a different style but I'm really pleased for the adaptation of winning games. Sometimes we are struggling but we can manage some things to win games and that is really important. If you judge our eight games, you know clearly what game we want to play.\"",
      "Arne Slot moaned about United's tactics, but Amorim declined to bite back at the Liverpool boss's remarks. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don't want to comment,\" he said.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen (against Brighton). I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don't care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don't need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "Amorim stated: \"We are always talking about that [a turning point], but that connects with the other question about how we face competition. If you just think about that - that we are going to try to perform and put everything on the field - that is the most important thing.",
      "\"Sometimes when you talk too much about turning points, it is worse. Let's take it naturally. We have won two games, it is no big deal, it should have come sooner. Let's go for the next game and it is going to be really, really hard to play against Brighton. Let's try to perform better than we did against Liverpool.",
      "\"Let's wait for the game. If you look at our wins, especially this year, it has to be a lot with attitude. I'm not saying that players don't want to win or to run, sometimes it's getting harder but sometimes we need to force ourselves to do the basics.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"If we do that, we are near to winning more football games but if you look at Brighton and you see the way they play, every team that presses a little bit higher struggles with them and they won those games.",
      "\"So all those things we need to be prepared for - not just against the top teams like you call it: Chelsea, Liverpool, but against these opponents that are really good, and we need to be really focused and really smart to play this kind of game.\"",

      "In beating the champions, they managed back-to-back Premier League wins under the helm of Ruben Amorim for the first time since his appointment last year. United will be aiming to secure a hat-trick of victories this weekend.",
      "That could propel them further up the table from their current ninth position, just one point ahead of Brighton. However, Amorim faces a few fitness concerns ahead of the match.",
      "Hero of the Anfield showdown, centre-back Harry Maguire, who netted the winning goal with just six minutes left on the clock, is a doubt for the Brighton game due to an injury. Mason Mount, who has been in the starting line-up for the last two games, is also nursing a knock.",
      "\"The squad is fine,\" Amorim said during his pre-match press conference. \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious, and we will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, however, is definitely ruled out. The Argentine is making progress in his recovery from an ACL injury and has returned to training, but is not yet ready for match action.",
      "\"Licha is out,\" confirmed Amorim. \"He trained really well, he was on the next pitch, and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well, but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",
      "It's not just United facing fitness concerns ahead of the fixture. Brighton could be without as many as six players for the clash.",
      "Long-term casualties Adam Webster and Jack Hinshelwood remain unavailable. Both are still recovering from ligament injuries.",

      "The Brighton manager also delivered encouraging updates on midfielder Diego Gomez, who came off during Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend. He was seen in training before Saturday's match, to which Hurzeler responded: \"I think he will also be spotted tomorrow at Old Trafford! He will be available to start.\"",

      "After the game, an apoplectic Amorim unleashed his fury on the players in the dressing room, slamming them for a dismal overall performance. Amid the chaos, he reportedly broke a TV screen used to share tactical information.",
      "It was a career first for the 40-year-old, who typically keeps his post-match talks short and sweet, no matter the outcome of the game. Typically, Amorim prefers to wait until the following day to review matches with his squad, once emotions have cooled.",
      "The outburst appeared to have an immediate effect, as United went on to win four of their next five games in all competitions. However, the season ultimately ended in disappointment.",
      "Amorim's team finished 15th in the Premier League - a record low for the club - and suffered defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham, missing out on Champions League qualification in the process.",
      "Heading into Saturday's clash with Brighton, the first against the Seagulls since Amorim's TV-smashing incident, the dressing room atmosphere couldn't be more different. Last weekend's 2-1 victory over Liverpool, sealed by a late Harry Maguire goal, has, at least temporarily, lifted spirits around Old Trafford.",
      "It was United's second consecutive league win and the first time Amorim has achieved back-to-back Premier League victories. A win over Brighton would see the team secure three straight league wins for the first time since February 2024.",
      "That, however, will be easier said than done given United's recent struggles against the south coast club. They have lost six of their last eight meetings with Brighton, with Fabian Hurzeler's side completing a league double over United last season.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to flip the script - not just for a measure of revenge, but also to sustain a rare run of momentum at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite a recent upturn in form and improving performances, Amorim's position as United manager remains far from secure amid reports club chiefs are considering their options. The former Sporting CP head coach will need to get his side firing consistently if he hopes to avoid the axe and that momentum must not be squandered.",
      "Getting a result against Brighton is therefore paramount and could prove the difference between building genuine confidence or plunging United back into another period of uncertainty and scrutiny.",

      "Carlos Baleba is set to play at Old Trafford for the first time since Manchester United considered signing the Brighton midfielder in the summer transfer window.",
      "Baleba was on United's radar, with the club even reaching out to Brighton regarding a potential deal. However, Brighton's hefty price tag of around £100million complicated matters, especially after United had already splashed out during the window.",
      "United insiders later suggested that bolstering the midfield wasn't a priority due to the squad's existing depth and versatility. Nevertheless, the 21-year-old remains on United's watchlist and could be considered as a transfer target next year.",
      "Saturday's Premier League showdown presents an opportunity for what could be a £100m audition. Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has offered some advice to the youngster ahead of the match, urging him to 'overcome the noise'.",
      "Baleba's season hasn't been smooth sailing, with rumours suggesting that United's interest may have caused a distraction. However, he showed signs of returning to form during Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend.",
      "\"'For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players. I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.\"",
      "The German boss continued: \"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Earlier this month, The Sun claimed that Bryan Mbeumo is 'attempting to convince' Baleba to follow him to Old Trafford. The duo spent time together whilst on international duty representing Cameroon, providing Mbeumo, who is regarded as a 'big brother' figure to Baleba, the perfect opportunity to have a word with the player.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of a crucial clash against Brighton on Saturday. United boss Ruben Amorim will hope his team can build on their triumph over Liverpool at Anfield last weekend.",
      "The victory marked the first time in Amorim’s tenure that United had won consecutive Premier League games, leading the Red Devils to set their eyes on climbing the table. The United boss will hope that the team’s lack of European football and increased time on the training pitch can lead to more consistently positive results.",
      "One United player who was in Champions League action earlier this week was Marcus Rashford. He scored twice and provided an assist in Barcelona's 6-1 win over Olympiacos, taking his overall goal contributions to 11 in 12 games for the Spanish club.",
      "The England international has embraced life at Barcelona since completing his loan move away from Old Trafford. Rashford recently spoke openly about his future at United, having not been part of Amorim’s plans since his temporary move to Aston Villa at the start of the year.",
      "Marcus Rashford has not hidden his desire to remain at Barcelona beyond his current loan deal. Barcelona have the option to sign Rashford permanently for £26million next summer and the forward has quickly impressed for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "Rashford’s impressive display against Olympiacos came at an ideal time, as he prepares for his first El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday. He showed signs of getting back to his best during his time at Villa last term and seemingly has no desire to return to United.",
      "\"It was so many years in one place,\" Rashford told ESPN. \"People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United.",
      "“So sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "When asked if he would want to stay with Barcelona beyond this season, Rashford responded: \"Oh yeah, for sure. I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player is an honour.\"",
      "Former Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo endured a nightmare evening as Racing Club lost 1-0 to Flamengo in the first leg of their Libertadores semi-final on Thursday. A late Jorge Carrascal goal settled the match but there was still worse to come for the Argentinian side.",
      "In the final moments of the game, Rojo was challenging for a high ball when the ex-United star’s outstretched elbow connected with his Racing Club teammate Santiago Sosa. A subsequent club statement revealed that midfielder Sosa had broken part of his jaw.",
      "The Racing Club statement read: “Santiago Sosa was transferred last night to a medical centre where he underwent tests. The player remained under observation, was discharged this morning, and presents a fracture of the right upper maxillary sinus.",
      "“He will be evaluated in Buenos Aires by a maxillofacial surgeon to determine the therapeutic approach.”",
      "Rojo was signed by United from Sporting CP in 2014 but struggled to establish himself as a regular for the club. He made 122 appearances for United, winning the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League during his six-and-a-half-year stint at Old Trafford. The 35-year-old signed for Boca Juniors in February 2021 and joined Racing Club this summer.",

      "Once their clash with Fabian Hurzeler's team concludes, United won't enjoy another weekend home fixture until Boxing Day - a Friday - when they'll entertain Newcastle United. Every single match the Red Devils are due to play at Old Trafford in the lead-up to Christmas falls on a midweek slot, which come with evening kick-off times.",
      "Reports suggest Berrada has contacted the Premier League about how the fixture list has fallen. The ex-Manchester City chief is believed to have referenced the added expense match-going fans have for games in the evening.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "The Athletic understands Berrada's discussions with Premier League officials were \"constructive\" with the United chief executive emphasising \"the cultural importance of match-going fans to the fabric of the English game.\"",
      "It's also understood he urged the Premier League to finalise their broadcasting decisions much earlier, allowing supporters to organise their Christmas plans around kick-off schedules. Berrada's talks with Premier League representatives clearly show the club is paying attention to United supporters' worries.",
      "Fan groups have recently voiced their anger over this season's fixture arrangements. They believe match-going supporters have been forced to cope with a problematic sequence of fixtures, particularly regarding the amount of home games set for midweek.",
      "The United Fans' Forum expressed their sentiments in a letter to the club, which responded with a letter of its own. The Reds are among several Premier League clubs who backed an increase in Monday and Friday night matches, a part of the new broadcast deal.",
      "This was also suggested as a solution to the expanded European schedule, featuring a record number of clubs competing across the Champions League, the Europa League and the UEFA Conference League. United didn't qualify for any of the continental competitions this season.",
      "However, they experienced the full impact of the extended schedule last season, playing 15 matches in the Europa League, culminating in a 1-0 loss in the final to Tottenham Hotspur. Amorim is aiming for a hat-trick of Premier League victories when his team welcomes Brighton.",
      "United's 2-1 away win over Liverpool meant the Portuguese manager finally achieved consecutive Premier League victories. The triumph over the reigning Premier League champions and the 2-0 home victory against Sunderland has also propelled United into ninth place.",
      "They're one point ahead of tomorrow's opponents Brighton, who have notable wins over City and Chelsea this season. Amorim hinted Harry Maguire and Mason Mount may both be doubtful for the upcoming match against the Seasiders.",
      "The United manager said: \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious and we will see tomorrow.",
      "\"Licha is out. He trained really well. He was on the next pitch and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes sought advice from Cristiano Ronaldo following interest from Al-Hilal, before deciding to remain at Manchester United.",
      "Earlier in the transfer window, Fernandes' future came under scrutiny following comments that he would remain at Old Trafford only as long as the club needed him. \"I feel the club wants me to be part of the future, so as I said, I don't want to be a player the club doesn't want to have,\" he said at the time.",
      "\"If for some reason they don't want to have me, I will go, but...\" The Portuguese's agent even entered discussions with Al-Hilal officials over a potentially lucrative transfer to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Middle Eastern giants were reportedly prepared to offer a £100million package and make him one of the highest-paid players in world football. While several Premier League stars have made the switch to the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes sought advice from five-time Ballon D'Or winner, Ronaldo, now two years into his stint at Al Nassr.",
      "\"I spoke with Cristiano about the situation, about Saudi and everything,\" the Red Devils star revealed. \"I wouldn't say what he told me, but we spoke about it. Obviously, he now has a manager who also spoke with me at the time [Jorge Jesus]. He was at Al-Hilal three years ago.",
      "\"The first thing he said to me: 'Are you too expensive for the club?'. I said, 'There is no expensive players for that club!'. But I told him the same, I wasn't eager to move, to go to Saudi Arabia because I wanted to stay at the club. And he's a manager I have a big relationship with. He was the one who trusted me to go to Sporting and to play in the biggest stages.",
      "\"But Cristiano told me, he had his opinion on what I should do. It was important for me. Obviously, with all the experience he has and everything, it was important for me to hear what he thought. But obviously, the decision will always come to me and to the club.\"",
      "In the end, the midfielder declined the offer and has been open about the situation with the United fanbase. But with the January transfer window approaching alongside the World Cup in the summer, Fernandes has admitted he's unsure whether the door to Saudi Arabia is now closed.",
      "He said: \"I don't know. At the moment, no one spoke with me about anything. As I said last time, I will even say to you, if someone told me, like, 'In the summer, look, we’ll come again.' No one told that to me. I don’t think they [Al-Hilal] were very happy for me to reject the offer, obviously. I accept that.\"",
      "But one thing is for certain, the 31-year-old has made it clear he would not entertain discussions about his future until after the World Cup. \"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still,\" he continued.",
      "\"So I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course. But from my side, that's not talked about, because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup.",

      "The Portuguese star subsequently turned down their advances, despite the purported £700,000-per-week salary understood to have been offered to him in the Middle East. He has since then underlined his dedication to United during a discussion with journalists.",

      "Currently, there's no indication he's seeking a move away, as he clarified to journalists. When he was directly asked if he is thinking about an exit, he replied: \"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still, but obviously I can't talk by the side of the club.",

But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",

However, when it came to concrete proposals, none were formally submitted to United, who remain determined to keep hold of their star midfielder's services whilst, also, being prepared to facilitate his departure should he wish to leave.",
      "The former Sporting CP man revealed details of a conversation he held with United chief executive Omar Berrada and football director Jason Wilcox. He continued: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him; 'Look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, or from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said; 'We won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.",
      "\"I'm not very sure. Scott [McTominay] went above that. But to go from that to the big amount that Al-Hilal was, like they could offer £80m, £100m. They were like more than eager to pay for the player to go.\"",
      "Since his transfer from Sporting in 2020 for a fee of £47m, Fernandes has been a key figure for United, contributing an impressive 100 goals and 87 assists in 299 appearances.",

      "\"When I was at Dortmund. I could have signed for Manchester United. I didn’t have an agent. And, in fact, the coach there at the time clearly directed me to his agent so I could sign for Manchester United,\" Meunier told RTBF (via Sport Witness).",

I have 45 examples like that. Now, I can’t prove them all, so I won’t name any names. But it’s something that, in my opinion, still happens far too frequently.”",

      "\"Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years. That's where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.\"",
      "The English businessman was also quizzed about potential action if United's majority shareholders, the Glazers demanded Amorim's dismissal, but Ratcliffe ruled out such a scenario, declaring: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "Discussing the situation with Sky Bet, Owen declared he thinks Ratcliffe's public backing of Amorim represents the right approach.",
      "\"I don't know what people expect Sir Jim Ratcliffe to say about Ruben Amorim,\" the former United, Liverpool and England striker said. \"Of course, he's going to back his manager publicly - that's what you do. He can't exactly say: 'He's got three games to save his job.'",
      "\"What else can he say? It's one of those questions where there's no right answer. Behind closed doors, I'm sure he'd have a more realistic view, but in public he must back the manager. That's just how it works in football.",
      "\"If Manchester United lost the next five games, the tone would change, but for now he's doing the right thing by supporting him.\"",
      "Owen also supported Amorim to remain in charge at his former club for the long haul.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim can be the man to lead Manchester United for years to come,\" he added. \"When Erik ten Hag was in charge, I said from minute one that I couldn't see it - I didn't agree with his words or his style of football.",
      "\"But with Amorim, I like what he says and his principles. With time, investment, and stability, he can succeed. Some massive managers have failed at that club over the last decade, so at some point you have to stop chopping and changing and just stick with someone.",
      "\"The club has changed everything - managers, facilities, staff, even the boardroom. Now they need stability and time to piece it back together. That's what Amorim can bring if he's given the chance.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Danny Welbeck will return to Manchester United with Brighton this Saturday with the forward in stunning form. Welbeck had scored 29 goals for United in 142 appearances when he was sold to Arsenal, aged 23, for £16million.",
      "The striker went on to score 32 goals in 126 appearances for the Gunners before leaving in 2019. A middling one-season spell at Watford followed and it seemed as if United had made the right choice in letting the Manchester-born star leave Old Trafford.",
      "However, the 34-year-old has gone from strength to strength at Brighton since joining the Seagulls in 2020. Welbeck has scored four goals already this season, and 41 in total. He has also found himself possibly back in contention for England for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Welbeck once revealed that he harboured doubts over his United future while David Moyes was in charge of the club, a whole year before he eventually departed.",
      "Moyes only lasted ten months at Old Trafford. However the next United manager, Louis Van Gaal, made it clear Welbeck could leave. The forward later claimed he no longer wanted to operate on the flank, as he had been at United, insisting the position was not conducive to him playing his best football.",
      "\"When you’ve been somewhere for so long and then you’re going to start a new chapter in your career, you’ve got to think about it a lot,\" Welbeck said in 2014.",
      "\"Over the past year or so, I started to think about what’s best for me. At the time I was playing on the left wing a lot and in a 4–4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can’t make an impact on the game.",
      "\"I can play it to the best of my ability, but that’s not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.\"",
      "He continued: \"You start to have thoughts but at that time you’re still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game – that’s just me, I’m not going to change that. But you do start to think about what’s best for you.\"",
      "Welbeck has reinvigorated his career on the South Coast. Last season was his best goalscoring Premier League campaign as he reached ten goals in 30 top flight appearances.",
      "On Saturday, Welbeck managed to generate headlines once again as he scored twice in a 2-1 win over Newcastle at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Since joining Brighton, Welbeck has managed three goals against United, including last season when the Seagulls won 2-1 at the Amex. Speaking on returning to Old Trafford, the boyhood United fan says he still gets a thrill returning to Manchester.",
      "“Yeah, I love it. I’m a Manchester boy, I’m a fan at heart. So it’s just like, it’s just home for me and like my friends and family are all there,” Welbeck said. “Obviously, the first time I went back, it was very strange, I would say, because obviously growing up at Manchester United, it was all that I knew.",
      "“So to even like go back and warm up on the other side of the pitch or go into a different dressing room, it’s so strange. But I’ve done it numerous times now, and it’s just like any other game really.”",

      "Al-Hilal put forward a substantial financial package in an attempt to tempt Fernandes away from Manchester. However, no official contact was made with United and Fernandes turned down their offer.",
      "Fernandes had explained his decision to remain at United during the summer, but he offered new insight into his rejection of Al-Hilal when speaking to journalists at Carrington on Friday.",
      "He stated: \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change.\"",

      "\"From Europe, I had some people talking to me, but we never got into the place where we would be offering on the table or not. Because it's all very nice and people want you, but then they need to put the money on the table for the club. If not, the club won't allow me to go.",
      "\"Obviously, I think the concrete one was from Saudi. To be honest, I didn't need to leave the club at the moment. I spoke with the manager, not only to Saudi, but also that's why I think with European clubs we didn't get into a point of... Because I didn't show very interest to go somewhere.",
      "\"So they a little bit felt that and they said, like, we'll be wasting our time and then it will say no in a month's time or two weeks' time. So the manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project.",
      "\"He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like 'Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project', or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"My kids love to go to school. They love the way they live here, even with the weather and everything. Today is nothing wrong [laughs]. But obviously, everyone is settled very well.",
      "\"We're very happy to be here. Obviously, we miss home, but my aim is not to go now to play in Portugal again. And obviously, home for me is Porto, not Lisbon.",
      "\"Obviously, if I had a chance to go to play again in Portugal, I would always put Sporting in front of everyone to get the chance to play for them again. But we feel like home here also.",
      "\"Many times, speaking with my family, we say sometimes the house we have here, it feels more like home than the one we have in Portugal because we were there for two weeks, three weeks, not more than that. And that was one of the many reasons that was behind that.\"",
      "Fernandes was questioned about whether he had held discussions with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, revealing: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was already in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him, 'look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said, 'we won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.",
      "\"I'm not very sure. Scott [McTominay] went above that. But to go from that to the big amount that Al-Hilal was, like they could offer £80m, £100m. They were like more than eager to pay for the player to go.\"",
      "The United captain added: \"And then from there on, I spoke with the manager also. I said, 'look, this is what I have, this is the offers that I have on the table'. Obviously, I said to him, I have to think about if the club says, 'we want you to go, because we want to get a different player. We need money to get more players or whatever'.",
      "\"That was not the case from the club. They always said to me that they will buy, they will reinforce the team. They wanted players. The manager said to me, like, 'no, we want more players to help you to become a better team. So we don't want you to go, because then if we bring some people and then we lose you, we're still going to lose something'.",
      "\"So more or less, that was the conversation between all of us. I spoke with one at a time. I didn't go to everyone together.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed his situation at United will remain unchanged and no discussions will take place until after the World Cup. \"No, it will be the same situation,\" he said.",
      "\"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still. But obviously I can't talk by the side of the club. I've seen a lot of news. I've seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"So I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course.",
      "\"But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has made his feelings abundantly clear on players who let down his predecessor, Erik ten Hag. It’s approaching a year since Ten Hag was shown the door by Manchester United following a wretched start to the season.",
      "The Dutchman failed to build on the promise offered by winning both domestic cups, joining the long list of managers to be jettisoned since the end of Sir Alex Ferguson’s glorious reign in 2013. It was clear that Ten Hag didn’t see eye to eye with a number of his players, including some he had brought to the club.",
      "And during the dying embers of his reign, it emerged that the former Ajax boss felt particularly let down by three senior players: Marcus Rashford, Casemiro and Antony, a player he worked with in the Netherlands before signing him for more than £80million.",
      "Teg Hag felt the trio could have done more to secure the results that would have kept him in a job longer. He was replaced by Amorim, who has had similar difficulties in getting the best out of some of United’s high-profile players.",
      "After being appointed in November last year, he quickly fell out with Rashford, cutting him from his squad and then allowing him to leave for Aston Villa on loan. Rashford secured a dream move to Barcelona in the summer and would like to make his loan permanent, severing ties with his boyhood club for good.",
      "Antony was also quickly moved on after failing to impress Amorim. After spending the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis, the head coach sanctioned his sale to the La Liga club for around £22m, even though it meant a huge loss of £60m.",
      "Amorim was willing to let Casemiro go as well, both in January and in the summer, but United were unsuccessful in offloading the high-earning Brazilian.",
      "A £15m fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). With no club willing to stump up that kind of cash for a player in his 30s, he ended up staying put.",
      "But instead of winding down the final season of his contract, Casemiro has been one of Amorim’s more reliable performers this season, tasked with sitting in front of the back four and breaking up play.",
      "Amorim will need the likes of Casemiro to maintain his form if he is to build on finally completing back-to-back wins with last weekend’s memorable 2-1 triumph at Liverpool.",
      "But as Rashford, Antony and others have found out, Amorim isn’t afraid to ostracise any player who isn’t prepared to buy into his methods.",

United followed a home win against Sunderland by winning at Liverpool, the first time they have claimed successive league wins under the Portuguese, but he's recognised the fine margins at play.",
      "Next up for United is a home game against Brighton. Defeat against the same opponents last season prompted Amorim to wonder aloud whether his Red Devils squad is the worst in the club's history, and his wider concerns haven't been diminished by consecutive wins.",
      "“No, what I mean is that we cannot change so much,\" Amorim said when asked about the media narrative around his up-and-down side. \"I think they ask me about top four in the end of the question. So, I don't want to change so much with the difference of 20 centimetres.",
      "\"If [Cody] Gakpo shot 20 centimetres here, the narrative would be completely different. So, I just want to maintain some calm, some direction in what we are doing. That’s what I mean.",
      "\"There is doubts if you are a manager in this kind of club, [and] you don't win a lot of games, people are going to doubt you. And they have reasons for that, but my point of view is that we need to be clear on our path and not changing so much because we win one game, that's all.”",
      "Amorim has made use of his summer signings, with Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha and goalscorer Bryan Mbeumo starting at Anfield. Benjamin Sesko came on for the final half-hour, and the boss faces a decision on whether to recall the Slovenia international to his starting XI on Saturday.",
      "United have lost their last three home league games against Brighton. Indeed, they have won just two of their last eight meetings in all competitions, with one of those victories coming on penalties after a goalless draw in a 2023 FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler was asked about the availability of Kaoru Mitoma, who scored at Old Trafford last season but has missed the last two games with a foot injury. The Seagulls are expected to make a late decision on the Japan international, though Diego Gomez is available despite being forced off early against Newcastle last time out.",

      "\"We won't complain [if he’s not]. We will find solutions. We have other good players. There might be a chance for Tommy Watson, there might be a chance for other wingers in our squad. But for sure, we will try everything so that he will be in the squad because he's a game changer for us.\"",

      "Fernandes signed for United in January 2020 in a deal worth £46.6million with Sporting standing the chance of earning up to £68m with add-ons. The midfielder quickly cemented himself as the club's most important player and has bagged 100 goals and made 87 assists.",
      "The 31-year-old has been linked with an exit from Old Trafford in the last two summers but decided to remain at the club. In the transfer window, Fernandes knocked back a move to Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal as United attempt to get back to challenging at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has been in charge of Fernandes for almost a year following his arrival from Sporting. And although the 40-year-old coach admires Fernandes' leadership qualities, he admits the Portugal international is not what he expected prior to joining the club.",
      "\"I think it's a little bit different from what I was expecting,\" Amorim said in his press conference. \"Everything you read about the players sometimes is not that. You can understand sometimes they already spoken about.",
      "\"The frustration that he feels is because he wants to help his team-mates a lot. Sometimes it's not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here. He wants the responsibility all the time.",
      "\"He suffers a lot with the losses. Every time we don't win a game, you can feel it. He takes it personally, as he should as a captain. He is a great leader, a great footballer, so let's see if he's going to reach that mark tomorrow.\"",
      "That assessment contrasts with how some perceive Fernandes despite his importance. Plenty of people have questioned the decision to hand him the captaincy including an iconic former Manchester United captain in Roy Keane, who does not see the star as a true captain.",

      "Fernandes was signed from Sporting Lisbon for an initial £46.6million in January 2020. United felt they had sealed a bargain, but nobody could have imagined the impact he would make in Manchester.",
      "Fernandes has scored 100 goals, contributed 84 assists, won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year four times and he is set to make his 300th appearance against Brighton this weekend.",
      "The 31-year-old has given his prime years to United. Fernandes was prolific in his first season for the club and never looked back. \"I don't know why I did it, some people get more difficulties to do it,\" said Fernandes about his electric start to life at United five years ago.",
      "\"It's a huge club, huge league, the difference between this league and any other one in the world is massive, not in terms of quality, but also the intensity, the way the football is played, everything is very different.",
      "\"I don't know, I was just hungry enough to do everything, because for me, I've said this many times, the first chance was the last one, so I had to make it. There was nothing else in my head other than making it in the Premier League, because it was my dream to play for this club for many years.\"",

      "\"I said, look, we have this offer from Saudi. This is because I've never spoke about this is an offer from me. We always speak in the big family. We always say we have an offer from Saudi because obviously wherever I have to go, they have to come. They can choose not, but I'd prefer them to come.",
      "\"And obviously, the first thing she said was, 'Have you achieved everything you wanted to achieve at the club?'. Because she knows I haven't. And when I talk about I haven't fulfilled my dreams at the club, it comes a lot from what she said to me. But if I don't try it, that's for sure I won't make it.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked whether the door to Saudi Arabia was now closed. He responded: \"I don’t know. At the moment, no one spoke with me about anything. As I said last time, I will even say to you, if someone told me, like, ‘In the summer, look, we’ll come again.’ No one told that to me. I don’t think they [Al-Hilal] were very happy for me to reject the offer, obviously. I accept that.\"",
      "He outlined that he was happy at United and would not entertain discussions about his future until after the World Cup. \"We're very happy to be here,\" he said about his family life.",
      "Fernandes arrived to speak with Manchester-based correspondents shortly before 9am on Friday morning, and there was a spring in his step after winning against Liverpool.",
      "\"It was good, obviously, very positive,\" he said about this week's training sessions. \"Ten years to now, we didn't have a good result there, not a good result, but a win, so it was very positive.\"",
      "Fernandes captained United to their first win at Anfield since 2016. He was given the armband two years ago and is seen as the ultimate standard-setter in the dressing room. Fernandes even watched the first team train in the rain when he was given additional time off last week.",
      "He already knows the names of academy players when they are promoted to senior training, and offered to pay for staff to attend the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "The Portugal international is a modern club legend. \"I just try to do things in a way that I can help the team and help the club to be closer to succeeding,\" he reflected.",
      "\"I haven't been much able to give the success that this club wants and deserves, and also the success that I wanted in my head to get when I signed for United, because when I came to the club that was my aim. I knew I was coming for a big club that played for big targets.",
      "\"And that's why I wanted this challenge. I've been lucky enough to do well, but as I always say, I haven't done well enough because I haven't achieved what I want.",
      "\"Every season I come back, I always have the belief that we can achieve something because you can have a very bad season, then you come back, you start the pre-season, you see the mood, because obviously the pre-season the mood is always very soft and very happy.",
      "\"There are tough training sessions and everything. But you always start to see certain things, like this season we might achieve what we want, but obviously, we know there is much more behind that.",
      "\"Everyone knows my aim is to win the Premier League and the Champions League with the club. If I'm going to do it or not, I'm not going to be able to tell you.",
      "\"Because if I were able to tell you, I would be very happy at this moment that I know that I'm going to win in some moment in these three years, [that] I'm going to win either the Premier League or the Champions League, but I can't tell that. If that's my aim and also the aim for the club, as they say, that's the truth.\"",
      "United's victory against Newcastle in the 2023 Carabao Cup final provided Fernandes with his first trophy at the club, but he considers the FA Cup triumph against Manchester City as an even sweeter success.",
      "When asked which trophy meant more, Fernandes said: \"The Carabao Cup is very special because it's the first one, but I think the FA Cup, not because it was against City, but because it's much bigger in England for the fans, for the football, it's the first domestic cup in the world.",
      "\"So it's a big pleasure for us. I had my brother living here before I came, so I knew already about history, about going to Wembley and all these things. I had the chance to go to Wembley in the semi-final against Chelsea, where we lost, but obviously with the empty stadium.",
      "\"I didn't feel the exact mood of the Wembley day. It was very special, obviously, because I know how much it means to the FA Cup, for the fans, for the club and for the country also.\"",
      "Fernandes has been fixated on winning the Premier League. United have gone through ups and downs since his arrival, and he advised decision-makers in the summer to sign players with personalities.",
      "He explained: \"Every time I spoke with anyone who was talking with me, they were asking we need to sign good players and everything else. We need to sign big characters, not good players because at this club, being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure, because of the attention we get and everything.",
      "\"I think we brought in players [in the summer] that are very aware of the dimension of the club. You spoke about [Matheus] Cunha. Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things and the right things, so that's something good.",
      "\"Bryan [Mbeumo], also the same. He's not afraid to take the ball, to do his play, to do his things. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League. And then we brought a very young goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] and a centre-forward [Benjamin Sesko], and they hit the ground running.",
      "\"Obviously, we know that Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not. But a part of that, he's been doing great, whatever he's being asked to do. He's got his goals already, and I think now it's going to come more and more because he's more than capable of scoring goals.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"Senne came probably with the intention of being the number one. He had to wait for his moment. The moment came and he was ready for that. So this is what this club is about. You come, the moment will be there straightaway and you have to take it.",
      "\"I think these four players were very good in taking that opportunity of ‘I want to be the one that is playing every week’. When we speak about Cunha, the thing of having the arrogance to say ‘give me the ball, I want to play, I want to make things’.",
      "\"With time, sometimes it won't be good for people because I've been through that. He always wants the ball, he's always doing this, he's always doing that. But for us, on the inside, we want this Cunha. We want you to take the risks, to shoot, to take people on, to create.",
      "\"Bryan, the same. Bryan, just get your shots on. Sometimes I get upset with him in training because he's like, one touch more, one touch more and everything. I say, ‘Bryan, you don't need that. You can one touch and shoot because you're more than able to do that. You did that against us when you were at Brentford!",
      "\"You just have to make it for us now. The shirts have changed, but you're the same player so we need that from you. Ben is very eager to learn and that's very good from someone that has done very well in the Bundesliga and everything, came with the biggest, probably like the price tag and everything.",
      "\"But in his mind, he's like, 'I want to learn, I want to become better'. Then on the weekends, he transforms himself into a different person on the pitch. He's someone that is like, ‘I know what I have to do. I want to score goals. I'm going to get into the box, I'm going to get into duels. I'm going to win my headers’. And that's very important for us.\"",
      "It was typical of Fernandes that he spent time praising United's new arrivals during an interview organised to mark his 300th appearance for the club - that is the type of person he is.",
      "Fernandes also demonstrated his humour when he was asked about Ruben Amorim jokingly telling Sir Jim Ratcliffe to 'f*** off'. \"I don't know about that,\" he said. \"I haven't said that to Sir Jim yet!",
      "\"When he comes along to the training ground, we always see him. We talk a little bit with him, but he doesn't get much involved in technical things with us. Obviously, I don't think we'll be able to do that as we're not able to do the work he does. But we have a good connection with him.",
      "\"Every player, I think, every time he comes, he tries to see everyone, talk to everyone. More or less, that's it. Obviously, he has Omar [Berrada] and Jason [Wilcox] who are more close to us to get the message through back and forwards. I think that's the normal relationship in a football club.\"",
      "Fernandes' contract expires in the summer of 2027, and there is an option for an extension. \"Yes,\" he answered about whether his time at United has been successful. \"Because when I came to the club, as you said, it was a dream. So to fulfil that dream is success. To be playing football is success.",
      "\"I wanted to play football, but I never dreamed... Not dream, I dreamed, but I was never very sure that I would reach the level I reached. I just wanted to play football.",
      "\"I didn't have a level on my head of how high I wanted to be. I just wanted to be happy doing what I do, because there's not much I can do apart from football. So I would say yes. Obviously, I wouldn't have every trophy in the cabinet that I wanted, but it would still be a success for me.\"",
      "Fernandes admitted he could explore a career in coaching when he eventually retires, but he still has more to give for United. \"I have to run much more than I do anything else,\" he said about maintaining his level.",
      "\"In football nowadays, you have to be able to run. At the high level now, there's so much difference to when I started playing, I had players who played with me that could run 6-7km a game and would be top still.",
      "\"Nowadays, if you run less than 9-10km, I would say you're really down on your numbers already. Obviously, I'm lucky enough to be very able of running and to deal with the demands of the manager, of the league and everything. I can't tell how long I will be able of doing it, but I've never had problems with this side of the game.",
      "\"But obviously, it's not just that. The competition when it comes to the club, I want to have the best competitions to play in my position. For example, as the manager said, I don't think Kobbie [Mainoo] is a competition at the same time, because I think Kobbie is very capable of doing what I can do in a different way.",
      "\"Because obviously, if you look at the numbers, Bruno is more capable of scoring goals, probably Kobbie is more capable of taking on people. We're different as players, but we still can give very good things to the team in a different way. So, I like the competition and the fact of having Kobbie that is very young, but very capable of playing high-level football, because he makes me improve, he makes me be a better player.\"",
      "Fernandes was pictured with a 300th appearance shirt at Carrington shortly after the interview. \"I framed all the shirts from the first game of every club I played,\" he explained.",
      "\"And then I have the special ones, like if I win a cup or win a trophy. For example, with the club, the first time I was captain, we played with the black and white kit in PSG away.",
      "\"So I've kept that one and the armband too. So it's small things, but it's what I'm going to keep from the future. For the future, when I look back, obviously you can go on YouTube and stuff like that, but I would like to keep my own memorable stuff for my kids in the future to look at.\"",

      "Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada has confronted the Premier League about the number of midweek home matches they have between now and Christmas.",
      "United host Brighton and Hove Albion at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. When their match against Fabian Hurzeler's side is over, United will not play another weekend home match until Boxing Day - a Friday - where they will host Newcastle United.",
      "All matches United play at Old Trafford in the run-up to Christmas are scheduled to land midweek, which means they will have an evening kick-off time. According to reports, Berrada has reached out to the Premier League to \"express concern\" about the way in which the fixtures have landed.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "It's understood by The Athletic Berrada's conversation with Premier League representatives was \"constructive\" with the United CEO stressing \"the cultural importance of match-going fans to the fabric of the English game.\"",
      "He also reportedly requested the Premier League to make their decisions about broadcasted games at an earlier stage, to ensure supporters can plan their Christmas commitments around kick-off times. Berrada's meeting with Premier League representatives is a clear indication the club is listening to the concerns of United supporters.",
      "Fan representatives recently communicated their frustration towards this season's scheduling. They have felt match-going fans have had to deal with an unfavourable run of fixtures, in regards to the number of home games scheduled for midweek.",
      "The United Fans' Forum outlined these feelings in a letter sent to the club, who responded with a letter of their own. The Reds are one of many Premier League clubs who supported an increase in the number of Monday night and Friday matches, which was part of the new broadcast deal.",
      "It was also proposed as a solution to the expanded European schedule, which features a record number of clubs competing across the Champions League, the Europa League and the UEFA Conference League. United did not qualify for any of the continent's competitions this season.",
      "However, they did feel the full force of the lengthened schedule last season, when they played 15 matches in the Europa League, which saw them lose 1-0 in the final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Amorim will be looking to make it three wins in three Premier League matches when his side host Brighton. United's 2-1 away victory over Liverpool meant the Portuguese boss had finally recorded back-to-back victories in the Premier League.",
      "The victory over the defending Premier League champions and the 2-0 home win over Sunderland has also lifted United into ninth position. They are one point ahead of tomorrow's visitors Brighton, who boast victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season.",
      "Amorim suggested Harry Maguire and Mason Mount are both doubts for the clash against the Seasiders. The United manager said: \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious and we will see tomorrow.",
      "\"Licha is out. He trained really well. He was on the next pitch and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes is happy at Manchester United and won't entertain discussions about his future until after the World Cup.",
      "Al-Hilal were interested in signing Mohamed Salah in the summer, but Salah committed his future to Liverpool and the Saudi Pro League club turned their attention to Fernandes as they looked to make a marquee signing.",
      "Al-Hilal offered a huge financial package in an attempt to lure Fernandes away from Manchester. However, no formal contact was made with United and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "In the summer, Fernandes explained his decision to stay at United, but he provided fresh insight into the decision to reject Al-Hilal when he spoke to journalists at Carrington on Friday.",
      "He said: \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change.",
      "\"From Europe, I had some people talking to me, but we never got into the place where we would be offering on the table or not. Because it's all very nice and people want you, but then they need to put the money on the table for the club. If not, the club won't allow me to go.",
      "\"Obviously, I think the concrete one was from Saudi. To be honest, I didn't need to leave the club at the moment. I spoke with the manager, not only to Saudi, but also that's why I think with European clubs we didn't get into a point of... Because I didn't show very interest to go somewhere.",
      "\"So they a little bit felt that and they said, like, we'll be wasting our time and then it will say no in a month's time or two weeks' time. So the manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project.",
      "\"He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like ‘Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project’, or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"My kids love to go to school. They love the way they live here, even with the weather and everything. Today is nothing wrong [laughs]. But obviously, everyone is settled very well.",
      "\"We're very happy to be here. Obviously, we miss home, but my aim is not to go now to play in Portugal again. And obviously, home for me is Porto, not Lisbon.",
      "\"Obviously, if I had a chance to go to play again in Portugal, I would always put Sporting in front of everyone to get the chance to play for them again. But we feel like home here also.",
      "\"Many times, speaking with my family, we say sometimes the house we have here, it feels more like home than the one we have in Portugal because we were there for two weeks, three weeks, not more than that. And that was one of the many reasons that was behind that.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked whether he spoke to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, and he said: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was already in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him, 'look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said, 'we won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.",
      "\"I'm not very sure. Scott [McTominay] went above that. But to go from that to the big amount that Al-Hilal was, like they could offer £80m, £100m. They were like more than eager to pay for the player to go.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"And then from there on, I spoke with the manager also. I said, ‘look, this is what I have, this is the offers that I have on the table’. Obviously, I said to him, I have to think about if the club says, ‘we want you to go, because we want to get a different player. We need money to get more players or whatever’.",
      "\"That was not the case from the club. They always said to me that they will buy, they will reinforce the team. They wanted players. The manager said to me, like, ‘no, we want more players to help you to become a better team. So we don’t want you to go, because then if we bring some people and then we lose you, we’re still going to lose something’.",
      "\"So more or less, that was the conversation between all of us. I spoke with one at a time. I didn’t go to everyone together.\"",
      "Fernandes said his situation at United will remain unchanged and no talks will take place until after the World Cup. \"No, it will be the same situation,\" he said.",
      "\"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still. But obviously I can't talk by the side of the club. I've seen a lot of news. I've seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"So I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course.",
      "\"But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",

      "Martinez suffered an injury to his cruciate ligament against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February. The defender has been carefully handled during the rehabilitation process, but he will not be available against Brighton on Saturday.",
      "Amorim added: \"I don't know [when he will return], he trained really well. Not with us, but on the next pitch and I was watching also the training.",

Because he plays in the centre, he does not need to go to the side so much so sometimes you help players with the way you play. Sometimes it is the opposite with some players. I am really pleased. He is not young but he can learn a lot, he can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball because he has that quality and he needs to show that. Nowadays with the set pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box and every cross from the opponent - everyone is playing like that. He is a massive player for us, I am really happy but that game is in the past, that goal is in the past and now let's look forward to the present and the future.",
      "We cannot change so much. I think they asked me about top four at the end of the question. I don't want to change so much with a difference of 20cms. If Gakpo's shot was 20cms here, the narrative would have been really different. I just want to maintain some calm and some direction with what we are doing. If you are a manager at this kind of club and you don't win a lot of games, people will doubt you and they have reasons for that but my point of view is that we need to be clear on our path and not changing so much because we win one game, that's all.",
      "I don't know when he will be fit. He trained really well, not with us but on the next pitch and I was watching the training. He is feeling well and responding well so I don't want to say a specific day or one week but he is near to start training with the team and then it depends on the rythmn of Licha if he wins the place or not. That will depend on him but he is closer to a return to training.",
      "We are really happy with Harry. Not the time to talk about his contract because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away. We are really happy with Harry, he is really important for us but we just need to focus on the next game.",
      "The first thing we were really focused during the game and then we played different games. We have one identity, one way of playing but we adapt what kind of game we need to play in the moment. You could sense that the first half against Sunderland was not the same as the second half. We know how to manage that. Against Liverpool we scored right away in the first play and then we managed the game and played a different style because it was needed in that moment - that is a good thing. Then we have a good spirit and sometimes when you have a good spirit, you have a bit of luck that you need to win games.",
      "It is a little different what I was expecting, everything you read about a player is sometimes not that. You can understand the frustrations he feels because he wants to help a lot the teammates. Sometimes it is not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here. He wants the responsibility all the time. He suffers a lot when we lose, every time we don't win a game, you can feel it - he takes it personally - as he should be as the captain. He is a great leader, great footballer and let's see if he reaches that mark tomorrow.",
      "We use the good spirit of winning games we know that was a good weekend for us but our focus is on the next game. That is in the past and we need to understand that football changes a lot, especially this kind of club so we are not thinking about the last game, we are thinking about this game and it is going to be really hard to win.",
      "It is going to be a very difficult game. Brighton are really fun to watch they are really good on build-up, they are really strong on transistions in every aspect of the game. They are doing well at set pieces this season so they are a team who are really complete. We need to be really smart and to face that game with a real focus on everything that we do because they are a very strong team. You can see with how they play the game. They are really intense, the quality is there. They believe a lot on what they are doing even under pressure so I am a huge fan of him [Hurzeler].",
      "Squad is fine we have some doubts some issues during the week with Maguire and Mount. Knocks but nothing serious we shall see tomorrow. Licha is out but the rest are ready for the game.",
      "Amorim has arrived for his press conference. Updates to follow...",
      "Amorim is speaking to the assembled media at Carrington as we speak. We shall be bringing you all the updates when the embargo drops at 1.30pm.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest here...",
      "After their defeat to United last weekend, Arne Slot seemed to be less than complimentary about the system that Amorim implemented at Old Trafford. Now, the Liverpool boss has insisted that what he said was meant to be a compliment.",
      "Before their clash with Brentford, Slot said:",
      "It was meant to be a compliment to the opposing manager finding a way to play against us but I don't think it has come across like that...",
      "Saturday will mark a big afternoon for Brighton's Carlos Baleba who remains on United's shortlist to improve their midfield in the future. Speaking ahead of the midfielder's trip to Old Trafford this weekend, Fabian Hurzeler has called on Baleba to drown out the noise surrounding his future.",
      "It's the next step for him as a person to overcome the rumours and the noise. He needs to focus on what he can control because he can't influence the rumours and the noise, only the things he does on the pitch.",
      "We will be bringing you all the updates from Amorim's press conference right here so do not go anywhere! The Portuguese head coach is set to address the media at 1.15pm with his comments embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "At which point, we shall provide you with everything that the United head coach had to say.",
      "United's captain is set for a special afternoon and evening at Old Trafford tomorrow when he is expected to make his 300th appearance for the club. In his previous 299 games for the club, Fernandes has managed 100 goals and 87 assists.",
      "Our United writer Steven Railston has spoken to him this morning and you'll be able to see what he had to say at 5pm on the MEN Sport website.",
      "We are just an hour and a half away from Amorim speaking to the media this afternoon. Here is what we can expect to be spoken about today.",
      "United's interest in Baleba didn't last long in the summer transfer window. Brighton valued Baleba at around £100million, which made it tricky for United to finance a deal, and they outlined that they were \"very confident\" he would remain at the Amex Stadium.",
      "The Seagulls had planned to have Baleba for at least another season. United sources eventually said the midfield was not a priority due to already having squad options viewed as strong and versatile.",
      "Baleba was considered at one stage in the summer transfer window, though, and United may have made an offer for the 21-year-old if they hadn't already spent a hefty sum.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "United's exciting 15-year-old JJ Gabriel trained with the first team at Carrington on Thursday. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "Hurzeler was asked in his press conference about United's inconsistencies under Amorim but Hurzeler was keen only to praise the Portuguese head coach.",
      "It's not my job to comment on that but the only thing I can say is that I am really looking forward to competing against one of the best managers. I think he is one of the best, of course he's not in an easy phase with Manchester but he's proved in the past how good he can be. Why can't they win three games in a row? I don't know because I'm not there.",
      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking to the media this morning and had this to say on United:",
      "I think they are playing more direct and more vertical style so more long balls trying to target [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko, trying to win the second balls and continue on the wing. Trying to attack the box with deep runs and of course they have a lot of individual qualities. They can change the game with one action. No matter who it is. They are a danger for us and we have to be staying alive for 90 minutes because they can score from every phase.",
      "Every United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "On Thursday, MEN Sport reported that Zirkzee was aiming to leave United in the January transfer window. It is understood that the Dutchman is keen to gain more minutes to revitalise his career.",
      "The World Cup next summer is likely to be a driving factor for the centre-forward who has not been called up for the Netherlands since November 2024. While he wants to remain in the Premier League, he would also be open to a move to another European club.",
      "West Ham are thought to be leading the way at the moment.",
      "Read more >>>",
      "United are looking strong at present ahead of the clash with Brighton.",
      "Mazraoui was a doubt heading into the Liverpool game but he managed to be fit enough to make the bench. Martinez is expected to be the only player missing from the squad again.",
      "However, he is closing in on a return in November.",
      "Amorim will address the media this afternoon at 1.15pm. However, what he says will be embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "Once that embargo lifts, we shall bring you everything he spoke about in the first part of his press conference.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of Amorim's pre-Brighton press conference.",
      "We will bring you everything he has to say this afternoon ahead of the Brighton clash, including team news and injury updates as United look to make it three wins in a row after last Sunday's excellent 2-1 win over Liverpool.",

      "\"Because, in the end, it's, it's only noise that tries to distract him from performing for us, for Brighton. He really has to focus on the things he can influence, and he can't influence the rumours; he can't influence the noise around him.",
      "\"He can only influence the things he's doing on the pitch, how he asks for the ball, how he's positioned when he receives the ball, how good his angles are, how much effort he shows against the ball, how intense he can be against the ball. That's the main thing he needs to focus on; the rest is just noise.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been \"surprised\" by the impact Senne Lammens has made at Manchester United.",
      "Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the October international break and he built on that impressive display by delivering another strong performance against Liverpool.",
      "The 23-year-old's long goal kicks were hugely effective in both of those United wins. Lammens made an important save to deny Alexander Isak during the first half at Anfield and received plaudits after the game.",
      "Speaking at Carrington on Friday, Amorim was asked whether Lammens' impact had surprised him. \"I think a little bit because it's hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he's not a young kid but he's still young,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"He coped really well with the pressure, he's really composed, he's defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style. I'm a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.\"",
      "Amorim discussed the direct approach, adding: \"I think you can see [progress] if you watch all the games. That game was different. If you have to point at a team who can control games with the ball, it is City or against Arsenal at the end of the game. Every team has to adapt and we adapt.",
      "\"We struggled to have long possessions against Liverpool, but if you go to the Arsenal game, it was completely different. Sometimes it is the environment, which is the first part we miss.",
      "\"Some players who are in different positions, who can give us more direct play than playing with the ball. We want to play a different style. Our style is a different style but I’m really pleased for the adaptation of winning games. Sometimes we are struggling but we can manage some things to win games and that is really important. If you judge our eight games, you know clearly what game we want to play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen (against Brighton). I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"We are always talking about that [a turning point], but that connects with the other question about how we face competition. If you just think about that - that we are going to try to perform and put everything on the field - that is the most important thing.",
      "\"Sometimes when you talk too much about turning points, it is worse. Let’s take it naturally. We have won two games, it is no big deal, it should have come sooner. Let’s go for the next game and it is going to be really, really hard to play against Brighton. Let’s try to perform better than we did against Liverpool.",
      "\"Let's wait for the game. If you look at our wins, especially this year, it has to be a lot with attitude. I'm not saying that players don't want to win or to run, sometimes it's getting harder but sometimes we need to force ourselves to do the basics.",
      "\"If we do that, we are near to winning more football games but if you look at Brighton and you see the way they play, every team that presses a little bit higher struggles with them and they won those games.",
      "\"So all those things we need to be prepared for - not just against the top teams like you call it: Chelsea, Liverpool, but against these opponents that are really good, and we need to be really focused and really smart to play this kind of game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has made no secret of his disappointment in the players who failed his predecessor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "It's nearly a year since Ten Hag was given his marching orders by Manchester United after a dismal start to the 2024/25 season. The Dutchman couldn't capitalise on the potential shown by winning both domestic cups, joining the lengthy list of managers to be ditched since Sir Alex Ferguson's glorious tenure ended in 2013.",
      "It was evident that Ten Hag had a strained relationship with several of his players, including some he had recruited himself. In the final stages of his reign, it came to light that the ex-Ajax boss felt particularly let down by three senior players: Marcus Rashford, Casemiro and Antony. He had previously coached the latter in the Netherlands before signing him for over £80million.",
      "Ten Hag believed the trio could have done more to secure the results that would have prolonged his time at Old Trafford. He was succeeded by Amorim, who has encountered similar challenges in extracting top performances from some of United's high-profile players.",
      "After taking the reins in November last year, he quickly fell out with Rashford, dropping him from his squad and then sanctioning his loan move to Aston Villa. Rashford secured another loan, to Barcelona, in the summer and is keen to make it permanent, cutting ties with his boyhood club once and for all.",
      "Antony was swiftly moved on after failing to make an impression on Amorim. After a loan spell at Real Betis during the second half of last season, the head coach approved his transfer to the La Liga side for around £22m, despite this resulting in a significant loss of £60m.",
      "Amorim was also open to parting ways with Casemiro, both in January and over the summer, but United were unable to offload the high-earning Brazilian.",
      "A £15m fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). With no club willing to stump up that kind of cash for a player in his 30s, he ended up staying put.",
      "Rather than merely seeing out the final season of his contract, Casemiro has proven to be one of Amorim's more dependable players this season, given the responsibility of protecting the back four and disrupting play.",

      "After a full week of preparation, Manchester United return to Premier League action on Saturday as they host Brighton and Hove Albion at Old Trafford (5.30pm kick-off).",
      "United will go into the game full of confidence, following last weekend’s 2-1 away win over rivals Liverpool. That victory means that the team won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim since his appointment last year.",
      "But going into the match, Amorim will be sweating over the fitness of a couple of players. Centre-back Harry Maguire was the hero at Anfield, scoring the winning goal with six minutes of normal time remaining.",
      "However, Amorim has confirmed that the defender is a doubt for the game against Brighton after picking up a knock. It’s a similar situation for midfielder Mason Mount who has started the last two games.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "\"The squad is fine,” Amorim said in his pre-match press conference. \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious and we will see tomorrow.”",
      "One player who will definitely be unavailable is defender Lisandro Martinez. The Argentine is stepping up his recovery from an ACL injury and has returned to training, but still needs a bit longer.",
      "\"Licha is out,” Amorim confirmed. “He trained really well.",
      "“He was on the next pitch and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",
      "It’s not just United with injury doubts for the game. Brighton could have up to six players missing.",
      "Long-term absentees Adam Webster and Jack Hinshelwood will be unavailable. Both are recovering from ligament injuries.",
      "Solly March is also expected to be on the sidelines, with a return coming later this year.",
      "There is, however, better news for Brighton on other players. Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed Brajan Gruda, Kaoru Mitoma and Joel Veltman are all close to returns.",
      "“They're all close to the team, so maybe one or two of them might be available for tomorrow,\" he said in his pre-match press conference. “They don't have big issues, they don't have anything serious.",
      "“I can't say that they all will be available, I can't say that they won't be available. We have to see how it goes today and then we have to make a decision.”",
      "The Brighton boss also delivered positive news on midfielder Diego Gomez who was forced off the pitch during Brighton’s 2-1 win over Newcastle last weekend. He was spotted in training ahead of Saturday’s game, to which Hurzeler replied:",
      "“I think he will also be spotted tomorrow at Old Trafford! He will be available to start.”",

      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",

      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",

      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",

      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",

    "body": [
      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Sporting Lisbon came from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, with former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood hooked at half-time.",
      "Greenwood came into the clash on a high after scoring four goals against Le Havre at the weekend. The 24-year-old has seven strikes and four assists so far this season, but he was sacrificed by Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi after the Ligue 1 side went down to 10 men in Portugal.",
      "De Zerbi's call to go safety first in the game has not gone down well with French media. Some outlets believe the Italian somewhat stifled his team's chances of winning by hauling Greenwood off and opting for a negative set-up, with De Zerbi seemingly still unconvinced when it comes to the defensive side of his game.",
      "Igor Paixao had put Marseille into the lead in the 14th minute. However, after Emerson was sent off in added time of the first half for diving to win a penalty having been set up by Greenwood, De Zerbi changed tact.",
      "His call to forfeit firepower in favour of solidity backfired as Sporting grew into the tie. Goals from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos condemned Marseille to defeat.",
      "Prior to Greenwood's exit at half-time, French outlet L’Equipe offered reserved praise for his performance. They wrote: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The outlet also awarded Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his first-half contribution. They said: “Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, subtly perplexed by Greenwood's hooking considering the player's general consistency, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has been critical of Greenwood's work rate ever since the ex-United player made the switch to France in July 2024. The Italian took another chance to remind Greenwood of his defensive responsibilities following the defeat to Sporting CP.",
      "“Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.”",
      "He told Canal+: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a center forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's strong words echo those he made in March, when he claimed he expected more from his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",

      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",

      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "The Belgian commanded his area in the hostile atmosphere and did superbly when he was called into action in the first half to prevent Alexander Isak equalising. In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

      "Ahead of the game with Liverpool, you could see that Ruben Amorim was a whole lot lighter after the victory over Sunderland prior to the international break. However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have submitted a significant ‘offer’ for AC Milan standout Rafael Leao amid interest from Liverpool and Man City.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd were very active in the transfer market as they overhauled their squad following last season’s 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "The Red Devils raised funds through several high-profile exits, with Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho among those to move elsewhere.",
      "This enabled the Premier League giants to invest around £230m on four key signings as one of the summer’s biggest spending clubs in Europe, landing Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Each of these new signings have made a positive impact and have improved Ruben Amorim‘s side, who have progressed in recent weeks and have won back-to-back Premier League games against Sunderland and Liverpool.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Despite this, Man Utd are still quite a distance away from winning the Premier League and/or Champions League, so they have substantial improvements still to make in the coming transfer windows.",
      "It is common knowledge that they are crying out for a new No.6 after failing to land Brighton star Carlos Baleba in the summer, though this area is set to be addressed in January or next summer.",
      "This is understood to be their transfer priority, though a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they have also ‘offered’ 100 million euros (£86m) for AC Milan star Leao.",
      "The Portugal international has been sporadically linked with a potential move to the Premier League in recent seasons, though he has been in fine form in recent weeks. Since recovering from a calf injury, he has scored three goals in two Serie A matches.",
      "Man Utd are said to have ‘accelerated’ for Leao, who also has ‘interest’ from Liverpool and Man City as the latter club ‘considers making an offer’.",
      "The report also claims that three ‘key’ factors will decide Leao’s future as he has an ‘onerous release clause’ in his contract, though the value is not stated.",
      "They added: ‘Secondly, his performance: he must maintain or increase his offensive level in more competitive environments like the Premier League. ‘And third, the player’s will: his personal decision will be key, even more so if he finds the jump to Manchester United or the media exposure of England attractive.’",
      "United have also been looking to the future with their transfer business and have tried to acquire some of the best up-and-coming talents in England and elsewhere.",
      "On Friday, a report from The Athletic revealed that they have ‘completed the signing’ of goalkeeper Charlie Hardy from Championship outfit Derby County.",
      "They have also revealed Man Utd’s plan for the 16-year-old England youth international, adding: ‘Hardy, 16, will go into the club’s academy system and under-18s side managed by Darren Fletcher, having completed the Premier League’s five-step process for registering academy players yesterday.",
      "‘He will sign a scholarship and be eligible for a professional contract when he turns 17 in July.’",
      "Arsenal reportedly have a ‘genuine interest’ in a trio of players they will look to sign after sealing a deal for Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze.",
      "Rafael Leao is attracting interest from Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, with AC Milan reportedly open to selling the winger this summer.",
      "Liverpool have AC Milan star Rafael Leao on their ‘list’ of targets once they have deals for Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool have been enquiring about AC Milan attacker Rafael Leao putting their move for Florian Wirtz in a little bit of doubt, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a response to Liverpool boss Arne Slot after his “low block and long ball” dig.",
      "Last weekend, Man Utd earned their most important win to date under Amorim as they deserved earned a rare win at Anfield, beating Liverpool 2-1 thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire.",
      "Amorim masterminded a great plan to get the better of Liverpool as he went for a direct approach and Slot had no answer for it as his side suffered their fourth straight loss in all competitions.",
      "Slot did not take this too well as the Liverpool head coach made a petty comment about Man Utd’s style after his team’s damaging 2-1 defeat.",
      "Slot said: “It is always difficult to play against a team that defends in a low block and mainly plays the long ball.”",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Slot has since added that these comments were meant as a “compliment” rather than a dig. He added: “We faced a team that had their game plan very well in order.",
      "“There was a bit of a debate over what I said after the game, but it was meant to be a compliment… so, they had a low block and played a lot of long balls. I was asked why it was difficult, and that was the reason.”",
      "Now, Amorim has insisted that he doesn’t care “what Slot is saying” as only he should “evaluate” his team.",
      "“I don’t care what Slot is saying,” Amorim admitted to reporters.",
      "“I can watch the game and say we can do better, and we need to do better in the future, but sometimes you need to adapt to the game.",
      "“So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team.”",
      "Man Utd’s four marquee summer signings, Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo, have impressed in recent matches and were key to the victory against Liverpool.",
      "Lammens looks to be a clear upgrade on former No.1 Andre Onana, and Amorim has revealed why he has been “surprised” by the young goalkeeper.",
      "“I think a little bit because it’s hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he’s not a young kid but he’s still young,” Amorim responded when asked whether he has been taken aback by Lammens’ start at Man Utd.",
      "“He coped really well with the pressure, he’s really composed, he’s defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style.",
      "“I’m a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.”",
      "Liverpool have reportedly reached a verdict on whether Jurgen Klopp could make a ‘sensational return’, while Arne Slot is ‘one game away’ from a crisis.",

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",
      "Ratcliffe has faced heavy criticism since joining the Premier League giants at the start of 2024.",
      "Upon purchasing a 27% stake in Man Utd for around £1.25bn, Ratcliffe took control of football operations at Old Trafford and has felt it necessary to implement a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books following years of mismanagement by the Glazer family.",
      "This was a sensible decision and it has improved Man Utd’s financial footing, though some of Ratcliffe’s cuts have been deemed too harsh as he’s quickly become a hated figure at Old Trafford.",

      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Ratcliffe has also made digs regarding Man Utd’s current facilities, with the British billionaire recently claiming that the academy has “really slipped”.",
      "During an appearance on The Times’ The Business podcast, Ratcliffe said: “The academy has really slipped at Manchester United.",
      "“You need the academy to be producing talent all the time.",
      "“It helps you financially. That’s not a light switch. You don’t solve the academy problem overnight. It takes time. We just recruited a new academy director.”",
      "Now, a report from The Sun has revealed how ‘staff and parents’ have reacted to these comments, claiming they have been ‘left bemused by his outburst’.",
      "It is suggested that these comments have internally gone ‘down like a lead balloon’ because there is the feeling that Ratcliffe has not given a true reflection of the academy.",
      "A source for The Sun said: “Sir Jim’s comments don’t represent what parents think of the club. All it has done is unsettle some of the boys and their parents.",
      "“He might even find that what he’s said means some families start to wonder if their child’s future would be best served at another club.",
      "“His comments aren’t helpful and are confusing as most are happy at United. They have access to great pitches, the changing rooms are fantastic.",
      "“They have opened a new parents’ lounge, and the boys can use the state-of-the-art facilities that the first team use for gym and rehab. It’s quite the contrast from Sir Jim’s comments.",
      "“The majority of the parents have said that Sir Jim seems to have his own agenda, which does not align with what is really happening.",
      "“The coaches try to be upbeat and put a brave face on, but you can tell that Sir Jim’s comments have hurt them. They don’t understand what he’s talking about.”",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",

      "A seventh player has been added to the list of Manchester United midfield targets, with Ruben Amorim green-lighted to make two signings in 2026, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim is eager to add a new midfielder after missing out on Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, and talkSPORT has linked the club with six players, while the less reliable Fichajes says Athletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet is also a target.",
      "The Red Devils tried to sign Baleba in August but were put off by Brighton’s £100m valuation. The groundwork has been laid down, though, and they could revisit the Cameroonian in January or at the end of the campaign.",
      "The report from talkSPORT says the Premier League giants want two new midfielders next year as Amorim seeks ‘more pace and athleticism’ in the engine room.",
      "Two midfield additions would be made possible by Bruno Fernandes’ departure next summer, with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested and Man Utd valuing him at around £100m.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, is out of contract at the end of 2025/26 and not viewed as a long-term option in midfield. There is a club option to extend his deal for a further year, and even considering his resurgence under Amorim, that wouldn’t be a wise financial decision as the Brazilian earns around £300,000 a week.",
      "Amorim ‘values him highly’ but as everyone is aware, he is severely lacking the ‘pace and athleticism’ required.",
      "With that in mind, coupled with Fernandes and Casemiro’s uncertain futures, several midfielders are being linked with a transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Carlos Baleba – As we are all well aware, Man Utd really like Baleba. Unfortunately for them, Brighton have ‘ruled out’ a winter sale, per talkSPORT. He is the club’s top midfield target and should be one of the sagas of next summer.",
      "Elliot Anderson – Are we looking at the perfect Man Utd signing? Anderson has been outstanding in the Premier League this season, leading the division for passes completed (569), progressive passes (71) and ball recoveries (64). He also ranks third for fouls won (19). He covers the ground required to fit Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has the ability to be the link between defence and midfield, and midfield and attack. talkSPORT says no talks have taken place and Anderson is keen to stay at Nottingham Forest. Great start, lads.",

      "Adam Wharton – Another young England international, Wharton is appreciated by ‘several Premier League clubs’ but is not expected to leave Crystal Palace mid-season.",
      "Angelo Stiller – The Stuttgart midfielder is ‘tempted’ by playing in England, and Man Utd have been linked by several journalists. A £35m release clause is tempting, but the German side can pay £1.5m to remove that from his contract. A bit of a no-brainer, that.",
      "Conor Gallagher – Another name being relentlessly linked in recent weeks, Gallagher is another perfect fit for a system that requires energy and an all-round game in midfield.  The report adds that Man Utd tried to sign him on loan in the summer, but Atletico would only sanction a permanent sale. He would cost at least £35m and is ‘open to a return to England’.",
      "Andrey Santos – Chelsea don’t want to sell and the Brazilian is ‘content’ with his playing time with next summer’s World Cup in mind. Next.",
      "Oihan Sancet – In a Fichajes report also linking Sporting defender Ousmane Diomande in what would be a £104m double swoop, Man Utd have ‘set their sights’ on signing Sancet from Athletic Bilbao and are happy to pay €70m (£61m). It would be fair to quickly disregard Sancet as a midfield target for two reasons: the source and the fact that he’s much more suited to playing behind the striker in Amorim’s front three. He is a top player, though.",

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",
      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",
      "“So I think now, as is quite widely reported, the interest in buying Manchester United comes predominantly from the UAE,” Jacobs said on the United Stand podcast.",
      "READ: Do Manchester United have the quality to offset ‘the new Ji-sung Park’?",
      "“The group haven’t made any offer to the Glazers. They haven’t even engaged in talks. So it can be simultaneously true that Manchester United are quite in the dark, and yet, there is a consortium out there that is building, and Turki Al-Sheikh tweet got everyone excited.",
      "“The word advanced was misleading. And although the consortium are maybe getting advanced in terms of where their money’s from and what it entails, it’s not advanced between a bidder, and Manchester United, in fact, quite the opposite.",
      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",
      "On the fabricated Beckham reports, he continued: “I have great respect for other journalists, so I’m not here to shout down anyone’s reporting.",
      "“You may recall when I first broke this on talks, but I said a series of ex-Manchester United legends have been approached.",
      "“But I have my doubts about David Beckham, because when Sheik Jassim approached David Beckham, and when Qatar 2022 approached David Beckham, he was willing to do stuff, but only after Qatar won, and only after, and he didn’t Sheikh Jassim won.",
      "“So I’d be surprised if David Beckham considered putting his name or his endorsement to any potential bidder for Manchester United until the point came where they were actually in the club, and then he may be open to some kind of involvement.",
      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",
      "Jacobs later pointed out that Ratcliffe “is not that fearful” about losing power as the takeover situation is “relatively quiet”.",
      "“I think the lines of communication are open enough that Ratcliffe, in agreeing to this sale, including the drag clause, is not that fearful that the Glazers are going to go in the next year or two, definitively in 100%,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“But let’s see if there’s a pathway to a strategic investor, or let’s see whether a consortium just blows the valuation of the Dragon claws out the water, in which case we may have to reconsider the position of all parties.",
      "“But right now, it’s relatively quiet on the takeover front, even though Turki Al-Sheikh got everybody very excited.”",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",
      "The Glazer family are “not really rushing in to sell” Man Utd following claims of a potential bid from a UAE-based consortium, according to reports.",
      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "A 38th player has been capped for England while at a foreign club despite having ‘just completely forgot about’ the national team after seven years out.",
      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports."

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",
      "Amorim is faced with the same chicken-and-egg scenario with regard to Mount, but without the goals and assists in the team besides to nullify his shocking lack of quantifiable contribution to points on the board for Manchester United.",
      "Paul Merson has called on Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim to drop Mason Mount for their next Premier League match against Brighton over the weekend.",

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has revealed he spoke to Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer as he weighed up a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Portugal midfielder, who has two years left on his United contract, also insisted that he knows nothing of an agreement for him to move to Saudi next summer and says talks with his agent are on hold until after the World Cup.",
      "Fernandes is focused on bringing major silverware to Old Trafford to add to his Carabao Cup and FA Cup successes - and says he still hopes to win the Premier League and Champions League at United as he prepares to celebrate a huge landmark with the club.",
      "In this extended interview, the 31-year-old also talks about:",
      "\"It was a dream to play for this club,\" says Fernandes ahead of that landmark appearance.",
      "In his 299 games, Fernandes has 187 goal contributions - 100 goals and 87 assists - a truly impressive record when you consider the highs and lows United have experienced in the nearly six years since he joined in January 2020.",
      "In that time, Fernandes has only missed eight games in the Premier League: three through suspensions, and the other five down to minor injuries and being rested.",
      "Few can forget how he hit the ground running in his debut Premier League season, scoring eight goals and setting up seven more in his first 14 games.",
      "\"I don't know how I did it did, some people get more difficulties,\" Fernandes said. \"I was just hungry enough to do everything because for me, the first chance was the last one so I had to make it.",
      "\"There was nothing else in my head than making it in the Premier League, because it was my dream to play for this club for many years and when I got the chance I couldn't waste it.\"",
      "For United, their ambition as a club is to win the Premier League by 2028, a target they have not been shy of making public. Fernandes, already a Carabao Cup and FA Cup winner as captain, shares that ambition.",
      "\"Every season I come back, I always have the belief that we can achieve something,\" he said.",
      "\"Everyone knows my aim is to win the Premier League and the Champions League.\"",
      "Last summer was eventful for the United captain. He was the subject of huge interest from Saudi Arabia, specifically Al Hilal, who were ready to bid £100m for him.",
      "\"I had conversations with Al Hilal, everyone is aware of that - from Europe I had some people talking to me but we never got into the place where we would have offers on the table or not,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"I spoke with both [director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada]. I think we were in Malaysia, that was when everything started.",
      "\"I told Omar, 'Look, this is what is on the table, I know the club might be looking at this in a way and I will be looking at it differently - so I just want to know your perspective'.",
      "\"Jason, like Omar, said 'we won't say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us because obviously it's massive money'.",
      "\"I spoke with the manager and he said to me 'no, we want more players to help you to become a better team so we don't want you to go - if we bring some people and then we lose you - we're still going to lose together'.",
      "Fernandes had also sought the advice of Portugal team-mate Ronaldo, who plays in Saudi Arabia for Al Nassr. \"I spoke with Cristiano about the situation, Saudi and everything.",
      "\"I wasn't eager to move to Saudi because I wanted to stay at the club - but Cristano told me his opinion on what I should do. It was important for me obviously with all the experience he has and everything - it was important for me to hear what he thought.\"",
      "Fernandes also reiterated that he has no agreement to move to Saudi Arabia next summer after denying the reports when on international duty with Portugal earlier this month.",
      "\"As I've always said, I feel good here, I want to achieve my dreams still but obviously I can't talk [for] the club - I've seen a lot of news, I've seen people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"My agent knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me it will be after the World Cup because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",
      "Fernandes is now 31 and remains one of the most creative forces in the Premier League, but he is reaching a crucial stage in his career ahead of the World Cup in 2026.",
      "\"I can't tell how long I will be [capable] of doing it,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"You have to be able to run, at the highest level there's so much difference to when I started playing - I had players that played with me that could run six or seven kilometres a game and would be top still.",
      "\"Nowadays, if you run less than nine or 10 kilometres, I would say you're really down on your numbers already. I'm lucky enough to be very [capable] of running and to deal with the demands of the manager, of the league and everything.\"",
      "Fernandes' continued impressive form is keeping Kobbie Mainoo out of the team at Old Trafford and the captain says he is pleased to have such a talented player spurring him on.",
      "\"I want to have the best competition to play in my position - for example, Kobbie Mainoo is competition because he is very capable of doing what I can do in a different way. If you look at his numbers, Bruno is capable of scoring goals, Kobbie is more capable of taking on people.",
      "\"I like the competition and the fact of having Kobbie that is very young but capable of playing high-level football… it makes me improve, he makes me a better player.\""

      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 07:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's win at Anfield was huge for this team, make no mistake about it.",
      "Getting back-to-back wins for the first time, not just under Ruben Amorim, but since May 2024, is finally a topic we do not have to talk about anymore.",
      "Also, to be the first United side and head coach to win at Anfield for the first time since 2016 is another impressive feat.",
      "This is in addition to the 2-0 win against Sunderland before the latest international break, which was seen as a huge challenge for a United side that had just come off a disappointing defeat to Brentford one week before. Again, well-handled by United.",
      "They are overdue a bit of credit after what had all the potential to be a disastrous few weeks, the type of few weeks that could raise even further questions about Amorim's future.",
      "Having spoken to a few of the players after the Liverpool game, including Diogo Dalot and Senne Lammens, I get the feeling the players sense this could be the start of real momentum under Amorim.",
      "However, United hosting Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend will truly be a measure of how this team has developed under Amorim in the last 12 months.",
      "Sometimes you come across strange statistics when two teams face each other. From memory, it was pretty easy to remember Brighton had beaten United in both of their meetings last season.",
      "However it is more shocking to learn that Brighton have beaten them in six of their last seven meetings. No team has beaten the Red Devils on more occasions than Brighton since 2022.",
      "For Amorim's only game in charge against Brighton, United were dismantled last season by long balls as well as their own errors - including one by Andre Onana, who is now out on loan in Turkey.",
      "With United's new keeper Lammens continuing his impressive start to life at Old Trafford, the side have improved from last season in terms of showing defiant defensive performances when they have needed to against the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Burnley.",
      "However, they will have to show they can contain Brighton's imposing and incisive style of play - a type of test they have yet had at Old Trafford bar the opening day against Arsenal.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba starred (while also giving away a penalty) in last season's win at Old Trafford and it will undoubtedly be an interesting subplot as Baleba's form has taken time to warm up amid interest shown in him by United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Since Amorim's arrival, United have won just 11 games in the Premier League. When you dissect those 11 wins, four have come against the 'bigger' sides in the league.",
      "Then you look at the other seven, five are against promoted sides, one against a relegation-threatened Everton last season and a win away to Fulham which, after a decent sample size, feels like a bit of an outlier.",
      "United have shown glimpses of what they are capable of but, other than Tottenham Hotspur in a few weeks, until they face Aston Villa on December 21, all of their upcoming fixtures would be classed as against mid-table sides.",
      "These are the games United have struggled in over the last 12 months, the games they have failed to consistently make an impact, produce a performance or gather consistency.",
      "This is going to be a pivotal time in the season for Amorim's United. The Portuguese manager as well as his players have spoken repeatedly about building momentum and wanting to put last season's troubles behind them; this is their first opportunity to do so.",
      "There will be interesting selection dilemmas for Amorim ahead of their match against Brighton.",
      "When you look at their two previous wins, he has gone with two slightly different teams - the first difference being who leads the line as the No 9. Matheus Cunha displayed an accomplished performance against Liverpool, but then Benjamin Sesko also picked up his first goal at Old Trafford against Sunderland in the previous game.",
      "Other dilemmas will be whether Amorim continues with the combination of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo on the right - their chemistry a huge positive of the season so far - and will Harry Maguire continue at the back after his Anfield heroics? Or could Leny Yoro be recalled with Brighton's threat of pace in behind?",
      "Interesting selections for Amorim to ponder but he has got all of his tactical and in-game situations right in the last two games, so this does not seem just a huge opportunity for his side but also for the manager himself who has made no secret of just how tough the job leading this United side has been over the last 12 months.",
      "If United are able to string back-to-back wins against two opponents they have had poor results against in recent years it would do wonders for this team's confidence but also perhaps it would gain the trust and respect of not just the fans at Old Trafford but of opponents, pundits and the media alike as well.",
