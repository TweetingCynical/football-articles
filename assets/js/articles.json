      "Antony has revealed that he was courted by numerous clubs, including Bayern Munich, before his departure from Manchester United. The 25-year-old was part of the so-called 'bomb squad' at United, a group of players deemed surplus to requirements and put up for sale last summer.",
      "The others were Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. Antony eventually signed with Spanish side Real Betis, where he had enjoyed a successful loan spell in the second half of last season. However, Antony's decision wasn't straightforward.",
      "He claims he received interest from Bayern, Benfica, Fenerbahçe, RB Salzburg, and Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr, as he considered his options away from Old Trafford. Antony's time at United was a letdown following his £85million transfer from Ajax in 2022, with the club taking a loss of more than £60m when he made his permanent move to Betis.",
      "Despite that, if Antony's claims are accurate, they highlight the untapped potential that many clubs still believe he possesses. Speaking to Brazilian media, he said: \"Bayern also approached me, but I had practically everything agreed with Betis.",
      "\"I was torn, but I was already 95 per cent committed to Betis. The financial aspect is important, but my happiness... I know how happy my son, my daughter and my wife are in Seville.\"",
      "In addition, Antony has alleged that he was shown a lack of respect by certain individuals at United. In a recent interview with ESPN Brasil, he said: \"I'm not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people. In fact, I won't mention anyone's name here.",
      "\"But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a 'good morning', a 'good afternoon'. Not even that.",
      "\"But, anyway, that's in the past, I won't give much importance to these things. Now I'm here, at Betis, I'm living here, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Nevertheless, he acknowledged his role in the expensive transfer to United failing to deliver results. He said: \"I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance.",
      "\"I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing. I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things; going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",
      "Antony looks revitalised at Betis and shone in their recent 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest in the Europa League. Betis headed into the international break occupying fourth spot in the La Liga table.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been left surprised at claims that a deal to bring fresh investment into the Premier League giants was at an advanced stage.",
      "On Wednesday night, Saudi chief Turki Al-Sheikh posted on social media suggesting United are close to securing new investment - with supporters and staff members both taken aback at the 'update'.",
      "Posting on his X account, Al-Sheikh declared: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "In 2023, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe held discussions with The Raine Group, who managed the sale of a significant portion of the club on behalf of the Glazers, with both parties expressing optimism throughout proceedings.",
      "Nevertheless, Ratcliffe emerged victorious and secured a minority shareholding. Sheikh Jassim submitted a bid of approximately £5.5billion to secure complete ownership of the club, but the Qatari failed to demonstrate proof of funds during negotiations.",
      "Sheikh Jassim's proposal featured a pledge to eliminate all of United's debt and incorporated a separate fund earmarked exclusively for the club and the local community, though his credibility remained questionable throughout proceedings.",
      "There has been no suggestion that Sheikh Jassim will make a return with a renewed bid for United. Al-Sheikh has emerged as the driving force behind 'Riyadh Season', a six-month programme of entertainment, cultural and sporting events staged in the Saudi Arabian capital.",
      "The 44-year-old plays a major role in boxing and has won plaudits for the sport's revival in recent years, having pumped millions into organising spectacular bouts between competing promotions.",
      "United could stage a mid-season friendly overseas to boost income and Alalshikh is understood to be currently engaged in talks about hosting a match in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Discussing a possible mid-season friendly to generate funds, Ruben Amorim said: \"We have to do it. We knew that when we missed Europe, and there's a lot of things [to consider].",
      "\"We have our fans, the budget. We have to compensate for a lot of things. We have to do it, so we will do it. We want to be with our fans around the world, so we will put it all together to do that. if we have to do it, we have to manage and to find the space to do it [in the schedule].\"",

      "Eddie Howe has underlined his commitment to Newcastle despite Paul Scholes insisting he would be his ideal candidate to come in at Manchester United if a change was made by the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "Howe has proved himself to be a top manager since arriving at St James' Park in 2021. He took over when the Magpies were in the relegation zone and has since made them a Champions League outfit and delivered a trophy in the form of the Carabao Cup.",
      "He's been aided by the club's huge wealth, but has still been credited with improving several players, many of whom he inherited. That has seen Howe's stock rise and he's enjoyed a particularly strong record against the Red Devils.",
      "Last term he secured a double over Amorim. Beating him 2-0 at Old Trafford in what was an utterly dominant showing before replicating that with a commanding 4-1 win back in Newcastle - and Scholes thinks he'd be an ideal manager for the Red Devils.",
      "The former player told The Overlap when quizzed on his choice: “Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe. I’m not sure about his mate [assistant, Jason Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Despite that wish Howe himself has addressed speculation linking him with other jobs - insisting \"I'm all in\" at Newcastle. He's continually been backed by the club's hierarchy and has delivered on that faith, which he wants to continue doing.",
      "Howe told Chronicle Live: \"I'm all in (at Newcastle). My commitment here is 100% here and always has been. My family is still here, and we are fighting every day to make a success of what we are doing. The season ahead could be a wonderful thing, and that is what we are trying to focus on, trying to make a success of the games we have coming up.\"",
      "In the past clubs who have welcomed wealthy owners in the Premier League have quickly appointed a superstar manager to lead their charge. Manchester City gave Mark Hughes a period before landing Roberto Mancini, for example. But Newcastle have stuck with their homegrown manager, which has paid off.",
      "Ratcliffe has confessed that Amorim has “not had the best of seasons” in Manchester after three defeats in seven Premier League games but underlined his ambition to give the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss three years to prove he is the man to lead them forward.",

The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "On the one hand, you have to admire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s loyalty. On the other, you have to question his blind faith for giving Ruben Amorim three years to turn things around at Manchester United.",
      "But, honestly, what was far more baffling was the comparison about how long it took Sir Alex Ferguson and, even more so, Mikel Arteta to turn things around.",
      "Fergie arguably took five years to get things right at Old Trafford and turn the club into the best in England and one of the most successful in world football. But, come on, that was the 1980s into the 1990s. Trying to compare those times with now, is ridiculous. We live in a very different era. Long before being “the most profitable club in the world” was a discussion point.",
      "Then, within his interview with The Times, he admitted that he was also comparing Amorim’s time at United with the start of Arteta’s reign at the Emirates. He said: “You look at Arteta at Arsenal - He had a miserable time for the first couple of years.”",
      "What the overlooks is that Arteta took over in December 2019, he won the FA Cup in 2020 and to win a trophy in his first season was a game-changer.",
      "Well, Amorim blew that chance in the Europa League final last May and so how on earth can you compare the two? Answer: you can’t. On many levels. And the reality is that even the FA Cup might not have saved Arteta the following season. But the Covid era probably did.",
      "Arsenal, like the rest of football, were playing in front of nearly empty stadiums through the pandemic and that might have saved Arteta when they lost 1-0 at home to Burnley. Their home form was atrocious. They were in a mess. The results were so bad that they were flirting with a relegation scrap. Arsenal’s then director of football Edu even gave Arteta the dreaded vote of confidence.",
      "The following year was not much better. But it was better. And yet they still blew up and missed out on the Champions League places. But Arteta still had the FA Cup.",
      "He dined out on that until the 2022-23 season when they became unlikely title challengers, backed by a very supportive board and a lot of money spent in the transfer window.",
      "Now Arsenal fans are still a little divided on him. In the eyes of some fans, he has to deliver a big trophy this season. The club back him 100 per cent.",
      "But the point is that Arteta comparison just does not really add up. United fans have been so supportive on Amorim. They chant his name and are being patient. It has been tested lately.",
      "Ratcliffe and United have also splashed the cash and backed him in the market. They have bought a whole new forward line - Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - to suit his unbreakable system. That’s some show of faith.",
      "I really admire it. But you cannot compare like for like. It does not always add up. As one United fan said to me: “We’re nowhere near where Arsenal or Liverpool were in that first five years.”",
      "Amorim, like Arteta, is young, inexperienced but inflexible. He talks well but his players are clearly not buying into or grasping his tactics and vision.",
      "United is also a monster of a football club. I’m not sure anyone can stomach three years of this soap opera.",
      "I genuinely thought United would make a battle for the top four this season. They spent big, had obvious flaws (midfield for a start) but it’s a decent squad.",
      "Yet they are underperforming massively. I am no longer so sure about Amorim. And the idea you can give him three years to get it right… well, I just don’t think anyone will wear that. Apart from, maybe, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, a Qatari banker and son of the former emir, has had his Manchester United takeover plans revisited. Back in 2023, his bid was up against one submitted by the eventual new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS.",
      "United opened their doors to investment and after a lengthy process in 2023 it was INEOS and Ratcliffe who snapped up nearly a 30 per cent stake in the club. He's now openly discussed the early stages of his ownership, leaving many pondering what might have been under Sheikh Jassim's reign. Two years ago, it was reported that the Qatari billionaire was competing with INEOS for a full takeover of the club. His team expressed at the time their desire to return the club to its \"former glories\" and boasted the financial muscle to make it happen.",
      "Forbes has previously given us a glimpse into Sheikh Jassim's personal fortune, rumoured to be around £900million. However, the Al-Thani family of which he is a member is believed to have a combined net worth of £125billion, more than enough to buy United outright.",
      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories,\" their statement read. \"The bid will be completely debt-free, via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation. \"It will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",
      "\"The vision of the bid is for Manchester United to be renowned for footballing excellence, and regarded as the greatest football club in the world.\"",
      "However, it was INEOS who secured a minority shareholding in the club two years ago. Following what has been a disappointing beginning to his United ownership, the co-owner has now urged for patience.",
      "\"There are two halves to a football team - there is the business side and the sports side,\" Ratcliffe acknowledged on the Business podcast.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor, is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"It's like a Formula 1 car, the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be. So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high level of football.\"",

      "During his 12-year spell at Manchester United, the Irishman won seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups, four Community Shields, and the Champions League in 1999. Since retiring, the 54-year-old has forged a hugely successful career in punditry after managerial stints with Sunderland and Ipswich Town.",
      "Keane is now best known for his sardonic take on the game and for his brutal dressing down of players, and will be on duty for ITV for their coverage of England vs Wales on Thursday evening. While he is renowned for his hard-man persona, Keane has also demonstrated a softer side to him in recent years.",
      "Adding to his stacked bank balance, Keane worked with Adidas on the launch of their 2023 Spezial Autumn/Winter collection, and while there's no confirmation as to how much he pocketed from his work for the brand, CEO of Onside John Trainor told Business Plus that Keane may have made as much as £851,000.",
      "Keane has been married to wife Theresa Doyle since 1997, with the pair meeting during Keane's days at Nottingham Forest. The couple now have five children; Shannon, Caragh, Aidan, Leah and Alanna, as well as two grandchildren.",
      "Speaking to The Mirror on meeting his partner, Keane said: \"I spotted a beautiful girl in a club in town. Her name was Theresa Doyle but she blanked me.",
      "\"She was in a steady relationship and didn't seem at all impressed by Roy Keane, the great footballer. In fact, I think my reputation was as a downer for all kinds of reasons. From time to time we ran into each other around Nottingham. I knew some of her friends, who told me Theresa was a dentist's assistant. Eventually, after her relationship broke up, she relented and we went out together. I was in love.\"",
      "The couple tied the knot at the Church of Our Lady Crowned in Mayfield near Keane's home town in Cork. \"I don't really mention her in public,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"But in fairness to her, she has been a rock in my life.",
      "\"Just brilliant. She reads me better than I read myself. I wouldn't say Theresa likes every part of the package. She knows I haven't got a halo over my head. Actually, that's what she likes about me. She also knows I am not the nastiest person in the world.\"",
      "Keane's daughter Leah is engaged to Southampton star Taylor Harwood-Bellis. The couple have been dating for some time and after announcing their engagement last year, they are now expecting a child.",
      "Keane has discussed his daughter's partner in good graces. After the defender's engagement to Keane's daughter was mentioned, he jokingly said: \"It’s not done and dusted yet. Things can change very quickly in the Keane household, let me tell you!\"",
      "However, the Premier League icon has praised his Hardwood-Bellis, on and off the pitch. Speaking of his future son-in-law, Keane said: \"He’s got a goal threat in him, even playing for Southampton. It’s nice for him. He’s a nice kid, his family’s done a good job.\"",

      "Manek will leave Brentford after spending three years at the club and his role will involve him overseeing the running of United’s Carrington training ground. He will take charge of travel, security, training facilities, staff management and infrastructure as United look to change the day-to-day running of the club. He is the latest appointment made by chief executive officer Omar Berrada and his remit will see him work across the men’s and women’s teams.",
      "Manek continues the path of people going from west London to Manchester after Stephen Torpey started work as the Red Devils’ academy director two weeks ago. He was previously responsible for re-opening the Brentford academy in 2022.",
      "United spent weeks trying to land Mbeumo's signature in the summer with the forward enjoying his best season to date last term. Brentford dug their heels in and eventually got the type of fee they wanted in a deal that appeared to suit all parties.",
      "Despite the team's obvious struggles this term Mbeumo has been a bright spark. His first goal came in the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby and he's also netted in the Premier League. He did have a forgettable first return to Brentford with United losing 3-1 in the capital less than a fortnight ago.",
      "The Bees have had to deal with wholesale changes over the summer. Alongside Mbeumo, captain Christian Norgaard left for Arsenal whilst Yoane Wissa, who was another of their source of goals, left on deadline day to join Newcastle. That was all after manager Thomas Frank left.",

      "But targeting office workers enjoying a crumb of a perk while owners have creamed off hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends over the past ten years is a rotten look.

      "In 2024, again according to BBC Verify, the Glazers then received £732million from Ratcliffe for what would become, roughly, a 30 percent stake in the club. No wonder ‘they are really passionate about the club’. It has been a cash cow of monumental proportions for them.",
      "All the while, of course, debt has been loaded onto the club. And Ratcliffe expects fans to believe the Glazers ‘get a bad rap’? Ratcliffe expects fans to believe the Glazers ‘are really nice people’?",
      "This is from the bloke who claims to be some sort of dyed-in-the-wool United supporter, albeit one who once had a Chelsea season ticket. Oh, and now, the fans should be reassured that Ratcliffe and his Ineos crew seem to be in charge of the day-to-day running of the club and the football operation.",
      "“We are local and they (the Glazers) are the other side of the pond,” says Ratcliffe. “That’s a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We are here with feet on the ground.”",
      "Local? Feet on the ground? Ratcliffe moved his tax residence from Hampshire to Monaco five years ago.",
      "As a tax exile, he is probably only allowed to be in the United Kingdom for 90 days a year. When he gave his first round of post-takeover media interviews, he gave them in his office in Knightsbridge.",
      "In his interview with The Business podcast - produced by The Times and Sunday Times - Ratcliffe appears to suggest Ruben Amorim will be given three years to prove himself a good coach of United.",
      "For what it is worth, I whole-heartedly agree that Amorim should be given a lot more time. But throughout this latest interview, you get the idea Ratcliffe is more concerned about the financial and commercial success of the operation than he is about the football success.",
      "“Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view,” he says, before adding: “From that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "Profit first, high-level of football second. That sums it up. And when it happens, Ratcliffe and those ‘really nice people’, the Glazers, will make more fortunes to go with the ones they have already got.",

      "Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have disagreed about who should become the next Manchester United manager, if Ruben Amorim is sacked.",
      "Amorim's position at Old Trafford is safe for now following United's much-needed 2-0 win against Sunderland last Saturday. The 40-year-old had come under severe pressure heading into the game but the Reds produced a solid performance to record three crucial points.",
      "However, there is still talk that Amorim could face the sack should results not improve on a consistent basis. Indeed, Amorim's future was once again a topic on Thursday's episode of The Overlap, with Keane suggesting that Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone should be United's first-choice replacement if a change is made.",
      "Simeone, 55, has been Atletico's manager since 2011 and has cemented himself as one of the best coaches on the planet in that time, helping the Madrid club win a number of major trophies. They include La Liga twice, Copa del Rey once and the Europa League twice, with Simeone boasting a 59 per cent win rate from his 749 matches.",
      "When asked about who should replace Amorim if United decide to sack him, Keane said: \"I've said it for years but I’d like to see Atletico Madrid's Simeone go in there. I know his mate (Andrea Berta) has gone to Arsenal, but I think he would just create havoc, good havoc.",
      "\"I think he would rock up to that place and say ‘this is how you do things’. There is no guarantee but I’d just like to see his personality there with his track record.",
      "\"People may say about the style of football, but they beat Real Madrid and scored five. This idea that he is defensive, he doesn’t like his team giving up goals and chances, but he can play a bit.",
      "\"They have that fighting spirit, he’s on the sidelines causing [havoc]. I like a big personality. Andrea Berta was a big part of the success at Atletico with the recruitment side of it.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Scholes offered a different assessment when speaking on The Overlap's Fan Debate earlier this week and believes that Newcastle United's Eddie Howe should be next in line.",
      "Howe replaced Steve Bruce as Newcastle's next head coach following the Saudi-led takeover in 2021 and he has since done an excellent job on Tyneside, transforming them from a relegation-threatened club to one that is challenging - and winning - trophies and finishing in the Champions League places.",
      "\"Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe,\" Scholes said. \"I'm not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Sir Jim Ratcliffe offered his verdict on Amorim's future and gave him the vote of confidence, claiming that he is prepared to give the Portuguese three more years to prove himself.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Manchester City are currently fifth in the Premier League as we head into the international break, having had a rocky start to the season. But Pep Guardiola's squad seems to have bounced back from their early struggles and now appear to be a force to be reckoned with.",
      "City experienced back-to-back losses to Tottenham and Brighton at the beginning of this campaign, casting doubt on their ability to contend for the title. However, their luck has taken a dramatic turn. A 3-0 derby triumph against Manchester United was followed by a hard-fought 1-1 draw away at Arsenal.",
      "Before the international break, the club managed to put themselves in fifth place in the top flight, just three points shy of the lead. The ever-dependable Erling Haaland continues to perform exceptionally well.",
      "However, the player chose to reject the London club in favour of staying in Manchester. He has since been rewarded with a two-year contract extension and his deal will run until 2031.",

      "But Guardiola's ability to convince the Brazilian to stay over the summer, while overseeing his impressive development so far this season, could yet prove to be the City manager's next great masterstroke.",
      "Club captain Silva is at a pivotal point in his City career. The Portuguese star has won everything there is to win in sky blue but his current contract expires next summer and he could potentially leave on a free transfer.",
      "Speaking before City's Champions League match against his former team Monaco, Silva confessed he \"knows what to do\" when his contract ends and reports from Portugal suggest that could mean bidding farewell.",
      "Portuguese publication Record reports that Benfica have a contract ready for Silva to sign in January. As they are an overseas club, they would be able to sign the 31-year-old to a pre-contract agreement and he would then join them in the summer.",
      "From City's perspective, Silva has been a valuable servant and remains the side's skipper, but the player has always reiterated that it would be a \"goal\" to play for his boyhood club. Whilst allowing him to depart for free is not ideal, City's frontline is already so deep and Silva has earned the right to go wherever his heart desires with the club's best wishes.",
      "The influential Rodri could yet again find himself on the sidelines after he was substituted in the 1-0 victory against Brentford. It is believed he has suffered a hamstring injury.",
      "This setback comes just months after he returned from an ACL injury that restricted him to just three league appearances last season. Rodri is often cited with making City tick and in his absence, Nico Gonzalez was purchased from Porto for £50m.",
      "Although he is young, he hasn't made too much of an impact and so with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri's injury struggles a concern and the Spaniard approaching 30 years of age, it could be time to plan for the future.",
      "Carlos Baleba was targeted by rivals United this summer and the Brighton star has a £115m asking price. According to ESPN, City were also in the race to sign him and the club should pounce now before their adversaries do to shore up the base of their midfield for the foreseeable.",
      "Baleba has been a revelation for the Seagulls and at just 21 he could star for years to come. He would provide the perfect cover for Rodri whilst acting as his eventual successor. The midfielder could soon become the first choice if City decide to cash in on Rodri, with Real Madrid reportedly showing interest in signing him next summer for a suggested £130m, according to the Daily Star.",

      "Saudi Arabian billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh has a net worth that reportedly pales in comparison to that of current Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, following his cryptic message regarding the club's future. United are currently in a period where the Glazers can sell the entirety of their stake in the club thanks to their 'drag along' rights being activated.",
      "This is common practice in the business world as it prevents majority owners from being held captive to the whims of the minority stakeholder. Despite the Glazers holding the power to sell from underneath Ratcliffe, there has been little talk of this happening until Wednesday night.",
      "In a surprising tweet, Saudi businessman Al-Sheikh suggested that the club could soon be owned by new investors. \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor,\" he wrote.",
      "If you are a fan of boxing, Al-Sheikh will be no stranger to you. Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, he is the founder of the Riyadh Season, which is a series of entertainment, cultural and sporting events used to advertise the country of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Thanks to the money on offer, the Riyadh Season has proven to be a hit for the Middle East country. Al-Sheikh has taken a keen interest in boxing and has organised several super fights, including the likes of Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk and Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford.",
      "He has also managed to attract the investment of WWE with the professional wrestling titan holding several Premium Live Events (PLEs or PPVs) in the country. This will soon include Wrestlemania, which is set to be hosted in 2027.",
      "Away from combat sports, Al-Sheikh also has a hand in football having purchased Spanish club Almeria in 2019. The club currently sit ninth in the second tier of Spanish football.",
      "In 2024, CEO Today magazine reported that Turki Al-Sheikh's net worth is believed to be around $2.8bn (£2.08bn). To put this in perspective, Forbes estimates that Ratcliffe is currently worth a staggering $17.2bn (£12.8bn).",
      "As for the Glazers, they are thought to have a net worth valued at a combined $10bn (£7.46bn), also according to Forbes.",
      "While he did not insinuate that he is the person looking to buy United, Al-Sheikh probably would not be able to even if he so desired. As is clear, he does not have the financial assets near that of those currently owning the club.",
      "His best bet would be to make up part of a consortium. But, as mentioned, there is no insinuation that he has any interest in owning the Reds.",

      "He's coming up to his first anniversary as Red Devils boss, but has endured a nightmare stint thus far. Nevertheless he appears to have the confidence from the man at the top, who has shown no interest in sacking the Portuguese head coach.",
      "If Ratcliffe did indeed give Amorim three years to prove his worth then he will have lasted longer than any United manager since Ferguson - despite having the worst win record of any permanent manager. As things stand Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was one month shy of three years, is the man to be in the job the longest.",

      "David Moyes failed to last a season when he was handed the unenviable task of replacing Ferguson. Louis van Gaal was then given two years at the helm, but failing to make the Champions League in his second year cost him, even if he did win the FA Cup in his last game.",
      "Jose Mourinho, one of only two managers to achieve a second place finish, lasted two years and seven months before Solskjaer came in. Erik ten Hag is so far the only manager to be moved on by Racliffe and Ineos with the Dutchman having his job for just over two years.",
      "Amorim was the first manager appointed by Ratcliffe and the team of lieutenants he set-up. They are out to prove they got the right man, even if all the stats and performances suggest Amorim may struggle to turn around the club's fortunes.",

      "Initial discussions have already taken place between Maguire's representatives and Matt Hargreaves, United's director of football negotiations, as per reports. Although the club activated a one-year extension for the centre-back in January at the request of manager Ruben Amorim, it remains unclear whether Maguire will receive a pay rise from his current £140,000 weekly wage, particularly given United's team performance in recent seasons.",
      "Last season saw the Red Devils finish a disappointing 15th in the Premier League and miss out on Champions League football after a 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",

However, losses against Arsenal, Manchester City and Brentford have raised questions about United's consistency throughout the season.",

Alongside Maguire in this group are Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton.",

Ratcliffe, who founded and holds the majority stake in petrochemical giant Ineos, is known in sporting circles for owning French club Nice and, since February 2024, his minority stake in the Red Devils.",
      "The 72-year-old ranked seventh on this year's annual list of the UK’s richest people. And, as one of the country's wealthiest figures, he has announced his plans to meet Reform UK leader Farage some time before December.",
      "Speaking on The Business podcast, the billionaire revealed: “I’m meeting with Nigel Farage before Christmas. He asked for the meeting. I have met with Kemi Badenoch, so we have had a hearing.”",
      "But when questioned about possibly donating money to Reform or any other political party, Ratcliffe emphasised his neutrality, stating: “I’ve always been neutral on political parties. I’ve never really had a preference one way or another.",
      "“I just want one that runs the country well. I can’t see myself paying for policies. It’s not my style.”",
      "Reinforcing his impartial stance, Ratcliffe said of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer: “I think he is a reasonable bloke. He’s a nice man and he’s well-meaning, but I’m just not sure it’s easy to manage his party.",
      "“This is not a criticism, because I do like him, but you have to make some tough decisions, and maybe he’s a bit too nice.”",
      "It comes after Manchester United legend Gary Neville’s recent comments about “angry middle-aged white men” stirring anger and dividing the nation by hanging up St George’s crosses and Union Jack flags.",
      "Almost emphasising Neville's point, Farage is widely known for his vocal support of flags being flown \"across the country\", almost as much as he's known for his immigration plans - which have been labelled \"a manifesto of hate\". His meeting with Ratcliffe is unlikely to impress Neville.",

      "“When I was driving to Salford City last night, going down Littleton Road, seeing probably 50 or 60 Union Jack flags. And on the way back I went down the parallel road, Bury New Road, which has got the Jewish community right at its heart, and they're out on the streets, defiant, not hiding or in fear.",
      "“And I just kept thinking as I was driving home last night that we’re all being turned on each other and the division that’s being created is absolutely disgusting. Mainly created by angry middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing.\"",
      "Neville went on to say: “The Union Jack flag used in a negative fashion is not right and I’m a proud supporter of England, of Great Britain, of our country and will champion it anywhere in the world as one of the greatest places to live.”",
      "Farage labelled Neville \"detached from reality\" over his comments.",

      "However, McClair remained oblivious to their romance when he made an unfortunate observation about Victoria's looks. The ex-Scotland striker didn't exactly keep his joke to himself either considering he publishing it in a magazine column.",
      "\"We were playing at Stamford Bridge and Victoria was there. We were on the bus outside the player's lounge and she was standing at the top of the steps. So she was right at the level of where we'd be sitting. You could see her close up and she had acne, right.",
      "\"I used to write this column in a magazine and I used to find things that I thought were funny to put in the magazine. Some of them were truthful and some of them were made up.\"",
      "One might expect Victoria's complexion to appear nothing short of flawless at all times. However, the woman destined to become Mrs. Golden Balls may have been spotted during an off day.",
      "McClair revealed how his children questioned him about the unexpected meeting. He also disclosed Beckham's low-key reaction to his written account of Victoria, who is set to feature in her own Netflix documentary.",
      "\"About six weeks after this event I went home and said to my kids I saw one of the Spice Girls. And they said 'Aw Dad, which one?!' and I said 'Spotty Spice.' And the kids are going 'You mean Sporty?' And I say 'no, no, the one with the black dress.'",
      "\"'Aw that's Posh,' and I say, 'No, no she's spotty. Spotty Spice.' So I put this in the magazine and I had no idea they [Victoria and David] were in a relationship. [David] didn't say anything to me.\"",
      "The couple only began their romance in 1997 and McClair departed Old Trafford in 1998. It seems probable the Beckhams had barely begun courting at that point.",
      "That could well be the sole reason why David didn't deliver a more heated response. Alternatively, the former England star may have felt too daunted to challenge such an established squad member.",
      "McClair, who clocked up 466 appearances for the Red Devils and secured four Premier League crowns with United, would likely concur. When quizzed about whether the up-and-coming talents were intimidated by the more seasoned team members, he replied: \"Oh aye, they were scared of all of us [older players], particularly me with things I'm writing in the magazine. It was respectful, I think. He's a good lad, David.\"",

      "Saudi chief Turki Al-Sheikh has talked up the prospect of a fresh Manchester United takeover bid . The club's majority owners, the Glazer family, rejected a takeover by Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani’s Qatari consortium when they sold 27.7 per cent of the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe for £1.25billion - but would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake in the Premier League giants.",
      "The Glazers, who have been in charge at Old Trafford for two decades, were seeking investment in the club and eventually gave Ratcliffe and Ineos a minority stake, but allowed him to take control of football operations.",
      "Their leadership at the club has not been overly successful thus far, but they remain committed to the project. Saudis only current involvement in the Premier League is via their ownership of Newcastle, but they continue to invest heavily in football projects.",
      "Al-Sheikh, who has had huge influence over staging some mammoth boxing contests, has taken to social media and said: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor ... I hope he’s better than the previous owners\".",
      "His comments come out of left-field with there being absolutely no noise around the Glazers wanting to sell up. The MEN reports that those in Manchester have been surprised by talk of any bid.",
      "There only possible involvement with Saudi Arabia is the possibility of mid-season friendly to increase revenue. Al-Sheikh is thought to currently be involved in discussions about arranging a game in the kingdom given his influence over sporting events.",
      "Ratcliffe, who did an interview this week and failed to mention anything about a possible takeover, has come out and underlined his long-term vision for the Manchester outfit. In doing so he backed his decision to make a number of job cuts last term, which proved hugely unpopular, but he insists will pay off.",
      "He said: \"If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high level of football.\"",
      "Sheikh Jassim previously claimed he would wipe clear any debt that existed on the red half of Manchester, but his takeover bid was ultimately unsuccessful. The Glazers were seeking an investor, rather than the chance to sell-up for good.",
      "Across the road at Manchester City ownership from the Middle East has allowed them to become the most successful side in England over the past decade. The millions from their Abu Dhabi owners have allowed them to conquer Europe and, more recently, the Qatari-owned PSG won the Champions League."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe insists his brutal cost-cutting at Manchester United was necessary to cut out 'mediocrity' - as he declared: \"No one's ever given me a free lunch\".",
      "Ratcliffe spent £1billion to acquire a 27.7 percent shareholding in the club in February 2024 and has since led huge cost-cutting at the 19-time English champions. That includes the billionaire INEOS chief overseeing up to 450 jobs being axed since he bought a minority stake - which handed him control over the footballing side of the club.",
      "He also stopped the policy of free meals for club staff and has angered United fans by raising match day ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners. But in defence of his save cost cuts, Ratcliffe, speaking on The Business podcast, insists: “The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.”",
      "He also insists that improving the club's financial performance was the key to sustained success on the pitch.",
      "“There are two halves to a football team,” said Ratcliffe. “There's the business side and the sports side. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you've got, the better squad you can build. It’s like a Formula One car - the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be.",
      "“So a lot of what we've done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing. If you look at our results for last year, we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we weren't in the Champions League.",
      "“Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "Ratcliffe has seen United produce their worst-ever Premier League season during his first campaign at the helm - with failure to win in the Europa League final against Spurs ensuring they missed out on European football this term. He insists he understands anger from fans over the club's results, but says it's a long-term project putting the team into position to challenge again for major honours.",
      "“The press, sometimes I don't understand,” said Ratcliffe. “They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow.",
      "“You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe, who is already unpopular with United fans, also praised majority owners the Glazers, who have drained more than £1bn out of the club during their 20-year ownership.",
      "“They get a bad rap,” said Ratcliffe. “But they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”",
      "Asked about their relationship, Ratcliffe said they were content to let him take charge of the club.",
      "“That probably sums it up,” said Ratcliffe. “We're local, and they're the other side of the pond. That’s a long way away to try and manage a football club as big as complex as Manchester United. We’re here with feet on the ground.”",

      "The 40-year-old has just 10 league wins to his name at United since his arrival in November 2024 and has been under immense pressure for almost the entirety of his stint with the club. United were only set to play in three competitions this season after losing out on European football following their Europa League final defeat earlier this year.",
      "That number went down to two after their humiliating exit in the Carabao Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town in August. Despite the disappointments, Amorim has so far retained the faith of the Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy who splashed out over £200million this summer on new players.",
      "It's not a common occurrence for club owners to give interviews about managers under pressure but that didn't stop Sir Jim Ratcliffe from doing exactly that. The Manchester United co-owner discussed Amorim, amongst other things, during his appearance on the The Business podcast hosted by Dominic O’Connell and Hannah Prevett.",
      "During the conversation, Ratcliffe opened up about United's plans to return to success with the club having gone over 13 years without a league title and 17 years since their last Champions League trophy.",
      "Despite United's struggles, the 72-year-old has stood strong behind Amorim and admitted he wouldn't sack him if he was instructed to by the Glazer family. Describing the Portuguese coach as a \"good guy\", Ratcliffe admitted it hasn't been a good start to the new campaign for the club.",
      "While he hasn't shied away from offering support to Amorim, he did make clear that the manager must demonstrate he is the right man to lead the Red Devils back to victory, while seemingly giving him a deadline to do so.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.\"",
      "United did fork out huge amounts of money to upgrade their attacking options with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving at the club this summer. However, it's not yet clicked between the trio who've scored a combined five league goals so far this season.",
      "While Sesko has netted in his last two games and slowly starting to grow as United's frontman, Mbeumo hasn't scored in the league since netting against Burnley in August while Cunha has yet to find the net for his new club.",
      "One player that could help ignite their attacking numbers is Bournemouth talisman Antoine Semenyo. The Ghana international has been in red-hot form for the Cherries this season with six goals to his name - only Erling Haaland (9) has scored more than the winger in the league.",
      "The 25-year-old inked a new deal with Bournemouth last year, tying him to Dean Court until 2029 but his supreme form has inevitably linked him with a move away from Andoni Iraola's side.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, United are ready to pull the trigger on a \"big money\" deal for Semenyo who'll certainly have a range of suitors in for him next summer and perhaps in January. Semenyo's form has resulted in Bournemouth sitting fourth in the league and without a loss since their opening-day 4-2 defeat to Liverpool.",

      "“So a lot of what we've done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "“If you look at our results for last year, we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we weren't in the Champions League.",
      "“Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "Ratcliffe said he understood the anger among fans over United's poor results but claimed getting the team into a position where they can challenge for major trophies is a long-term project.",
      "“The press, sometimes I don't understand,” said Ratcliffe. “They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow.",
      "“You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe, already unpopular with United fans, risked further alienating the support base by praising reviled majority owners the Glazers, who have drained more than £1billion out of the club over their 20-year ownership to line their own pockets.",
      "“They get a bad rap,” said Ratcliffe. “But they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”",
      "Asked about his relationship with the Glazers, Ratcliffe said they were content to let him take charge of the club. “That probably sums it up.,” said Ratcliffe. “We're local, and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "“That’s a long way away to try and manage a football club as big as complex as Manchester United. We’re here with feet on the ground.”",

      "Saudi government official and chairman of the General Entertainment Authority Turki Al-Sheikh has fuelled speculation surrounding a Manchester United takeover after claiming that he has heard the club is 'in an advanced stage' of being sold to new investors.",
      "On Christmas Eve 2023, United confirmed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe had won the race to invest in the club. Despite initial hopes from the fanbase that it would be a majority takeover, Ineos settled to purchase a minority stake which gave them control of the football project.",
      "Since February 2024, Ratcliffe and co. have been making decisions on the football side of the club. While some decisions, like the appointment of Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have been heralded as successes, cost-cutting measures and the pursuit of Dan Ashworth before cutting ties after less than six months have damaged the perception of Ratcliffe with some sections of the fanbase.",
      "In a surprising move on Wednesday night, Al-Sheikh, who is best known for his work in boxing and helping to create super fights, expressed his delight at news of a potential takeover at United. \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor,\" he wrote on X.",
      "\"I hope he’s better than the previous owners.\" At this stage, there has been no suggestion that the Glazers were preparing to sell their stake in United.",
      "However, back in May it was reported that the Glazers could now activate their 'drag along' rights. This means that the majority investor can sell the entirety of the club without the minority investor, in this case Ratcliffe, blocking them.",
      "This is a common clause in the business world and its aim is to stop minority investors from holding the majority owner to ransom by refusing to sell their stake. Speaking on The Business Podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, this week, Ratcliffe made no suggestion that his time at Old Trafford was coming to an end.",
      "\"If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever,\" he explained.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League. Those numbers will get better.",
      "\"Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\" Ratcliffe also insisted that the Glazers have not told him to sack Ruben Amorim who has endured a mixed start to the Premier League campaign.",

      "Good morning and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, October 8.",
      "We might only be in the midst of the second international break of the season, but build-up towards the January transfer window is well underway. Joshua Zirkzee appears to be the latest player looking towards the exit door at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dutchman has been used sparingly this season by Ruben Amorim and it's believed that Zirkzee wants to try his hand elsewhere. Marcus Rashford has remained a trending topic after his bright start to life at Barcelona with a second consecutive England call-up handed to him.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains of interest to United with the midfielder in action alongside new signing Bryan Mbeumo and outcast Andre Onana.",
      "As always, we will keep you across any other major United developments throughout the day right here.",
      "Take a look at the latest Manchester United updates below...",
      "Manchester United look set to appoint Brentford’s chief operating officer, Ameesh Manek, as the club's new director of football operations.",
      "The BBC claims the Bees chief has agreed to take on the director of football operations position and that staff at both clubs were informed of the appointment earlier today.",
      "Manek is set to move north and his job will be to oversee the running of United's Carrington training ground.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, when speaking on The Times' 'The Business' Podcast, issued a clear Ruben Amorim verdict after a challenging start to the season for Manchester United",
      "He has not had the best of seasons. Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.",
      "“It’s not going to happen [Amorim be sacked if the Glazers told him to].”",
      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has offered a verdict on Ruben Amorim's stubbornness to continue playing a back five.",
      "Amorim has persisted with his methods of using wing-backs and a midfield pivot despite often being tactically undone and overrun. Meulensteen has now provided his verdict on the topic with sack pressure on Amorim only easing after a recent 2-0 win against Sunderland.",
      "No system is the problem in football. The question to ask is whether the players you have can apply it correctly. And if they can't, you have to adapt. The problem is that he keeps trying the same things and nothing changes.",
      "Ruben Amorim looks set for a huge Manchester United injury boost after the international break with Lisandro Martinez set to return to training, for according to the Mail.",
      "Their report has stated that a positive scan result on his knee means he is ready \"to step up to the final stage of his rehabilitation\".",
      "The Argentine has missed the last eight months with a serious knee injury but appears on target to make a return this month after resuming light training back in July.",
      "Despite only having 15 minutes on the pitch after replacing Carlos Baleba, Bryan Mbeumo made one hell of an impact for Ghana on international duty.",
      "With the score against Mauritius at 1-0, Mbeumo's run into the box was picked out by Christian Bassogog and while his first effort was saved, Mbeumo was on hand to tuck home the rebound and make it 2-0.",
      "That is now five goal contributions for the 26-year-old since his move from Brentford with Ruben Amorim likely delighted he has not played a full 90 minutes but has still found the back of the net.",
      "Romano was also on hand to issue a clear update on the future of Bruno Fernandes after reports emerged suggesting he had agreed to move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Portugal international was of firm interest to Al-Nassr but opted to stay at Old Trafford. Interest from the Middle East in acquiring his services has remained, however.",
      "Nothing at all at the moment. Full focus on United, new deal was signed one year ago, so nothing concrete at this stage. Saudis remain interested as they've been for the last three years but nothing else now.",
      "Carlos Baleba has been joined by Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton as midfielders being linked to Manchester United.",
      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, via GiveMeSport, has shed some light on the club's potential plans for the upcoming January window.",
      "There’s a possibility of Man United going for a midfielder in January but it depends on opportunities. Unless there is a big name it is likey to be a window of a loan deal or last minute chance on the market.",
      "Carlos Baleba is one of three players currently in action likely of interest to Manchester United.",
      "Late into the summer window, enquiries for made to understand conditions of a potential deal but nothing materialised. Baleba has not completed a game this season with his withdrawal at half-time in last Sunday's draw against Wolves the third time he has been taken off at the interval.",
      "In action for Cameroon against Mauritius, he made it to 75 minutes before being replaced by United attacker Bryan Mbeumo. It is very likely that Ruben Amorim will be glad to see him not playing the full game but also keeping some match sharpness.",
      "United loannee Andre Onana played the entirety of the match but only had one save to make. Two of his appearances for Trabzonspor have been very different to that with a total of 15 saves made. He has also picked up an assist since joining.",
      "Manchester United have announced the academy building at Carrington will be redeveloped.",
      "United unveiled a £50million makeover to the main building in August and have announced plans to bring academy facilities in line with the 'leading standards' they have for the first-team.",
      "There will be upheaval while the academy building is redeveloped, meaning the Under-21s and Under-18s will use the modular building, a two-storey block behind the main building. The women's team used the same set-up during the £10m redevelopment of their facilities at Carrington.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United talent Shea Lacey has joined the England senior team for training at St George's Park ahead of Thursday's friendly against Wales at Wembley.",
      "The attacking midfielder was named in the Under 20s group for the first time, after an impressive start to the 2025/26 campaign with United.",
      "However, he was one of three players promoted into manager Thomas Tuchel's senior session, with Lakyle Samuel and Harrison Murray-Campbell the others linking up with the squad.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is still attracting interest from Napoli and could make the move to the Serie A side in January.",
      "\"In advanced discussions with Manchester United at the very end of the summer transfer window, Napoli are maintaining contact with Kobbie Mainoo's entourage,\" Tavolieri said. \"What's more, the Partenopei are reportedly in pole position to land the promising English midfielder.",
      "\"A loan move is being considered as early as the January transfer window to give him more playing time and continue his development in a competitive environment. The Italian club hopes to conclude this deal quickly.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's future has become the subject of speculation as a move away from Manchester United is reportedly on the cards.",
      "Reports have claimed that Zirkzee may consider an Old trafford exit when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United has been the subject of speculation for several weeks, and now a fresh update has emerged.",
      "A report has claimed that United chiefs have held talks with members of the squad to determine if there is still support within the group for Amorim.",
      "Even though Marcus Rashford is enjoying life in Barcelona, the Manchester United star has seen his transfer value drop this season.",
      "Rashford left United to join Barca on loan for the season, and has already scored three goals and provided five assists at the Camp Nou.",
      "However, that form has not been enough to prevent Rashford's market value from falling this season.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Maguire is open to remaining at United beyond the end of his current contract which expires this summer.",
      "However, if he is to stay at Old Trafford, it is thought that he will need to accept a pay cut.",
      "Maguire has started just two Premier League matches this season - the win against Chelsea and the defeat over Brentford.",
      "One option United could look at to replace Zirkzee is Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Juventus man is being pushed out of Turin and is expected to leave no matter what next summer.",
      "United have been linked with him before but their hopes of signing him this time around could be slim as Bayern Munich are thought to be keen on the centre-forward and Vlahovic is believed to be open to the move.",
      "Napoli were keen on Zirkzee in the summer but signed Hojlund instead so they are likely to be out of the race this time around.",
      "The Mail understands Juventus and PSV Eindhoven hold an interest in Zirkzee and both would provide the Netherlands international with opportunities to play.",
      "However, the Reds would need to sign a replacement to allow Zirkzee to leave.",
      "That's according to the Daily Mail who claim that Zirkzee wants to leave United at the soonest opportunity.",
      "It is believed the forward is frustrated by his lack of minutes so far this season following the arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Zirkzee is keen to ensure a move is completed in January so as to boost his chances of making the World Cup squad.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog!",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the latest United news in this opening few hours of the morning.",

      "Each one comes with a heavy selection of pros and cons but none seem likely to arrive through the doors at Old Trafford any time soon. That's because the man with the power to hire and fire has already set out the minimum life span that Amorim is going to receive.",
      "In the inaugural episode of The Business Podcast, Sir Jim Ratcliffe sat down and spoke about all things United. Among the topics he was quizzed on was the future of the incumbent at the Theatre of Dreams and his response will perhaps create more problems than solutions.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe admitted about Amorim after suggesting he is a good guy. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.",
      "\"That's where I would be [on the prospect of sacking Amorim].\" We can perhaps all agree that Ratcliffe's stance is a noble one.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "£35",
      "The constant hiring and firing of managers across the last 10 years has not helped United up to this point, and nobody truly wants to see someone lose their job, even if their severance package cushions the blow. However, by admitting that so openly, the Ineos founder has little choice but to stick to his guns now.",
      "While The 1958 group's protests against Ratcliffe were abandoned, there remains a section of the United fanbase who are still on the fence about the billionaire's decisions. Take, for instance, the overly complicated pursuit and hiring of Dan Ashworth, only to drop him months after arriving at the club.",
      "That was an embarrassing failure for Ratcliffe and he simply cannot afford a repeat. Next month marks a year in charge for Amorim and if United are slumped back in the bottom half of the table again by his anniversary, questions will once again be asked of the Portuguese head coach.",
      "So what happens then? Ratcliffe will need to stick to his guns and provide Amorim with a further two years or he will U-turn, undermining what he has said about keeping the head coach.",
      "Neither option makes Ratcliffe look good but he could have lessened the criticism if he had simply not set a timeframe for when he will judge his manager. He is now forever tied to that position and the only way he can save face is if Amorim can turn the club around quickly.",
      "Nobody expects Amorim to be competing for titles immediately, but he needs to do much better than last year. For now, the jury is still out on whether he can manage just that."

He arrived in Barcelona in July on a 12-month loan deal, but this move includes an option to buy the 27-year-old.",

Should Barcelona wish to make his move permanent, it would cost them a reported £26million and if United want to recoup a fee for the forward the Catalan club's economic results spell good news.",

      "Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have clashed over who ought to take charge at Manchester United, should Ruben Amorim be dismissed.",
      "Amorim's role at Old Trafford remains secure for the time being after United's vital 2-0 triumph over Sunderland last Saturday. The 40-year-old had faced mounting scrutiny ahead of that fixture, but the Red Devils delivered a commanding display to secure three essential points.",
      "Nevertheless, speculation persists that Amorim might be shown the door unless results begin to improve consistently. Amorim's prospects were once more discussed during Thursday's instalment of The Overlap, with Keane proposing that Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone ought to be United's preferred option should a managerial switch occur.",
      "Simeone, 55, has overseen Atletico since 2011 and has established himself as amongst the finest tacticians globally during that period, guiding the Madrid outfit to numerous significant honours. These encompass La Liga on two occasions, the Copa del Rey once and the Europa League twice, with Simeone maintaining a 59 per cent success rate across his 749 fixtures.",
      "When questioned about who ought to succeed Amorim should United opt to dismiss him, Keane said: \"I've said it for years but I'd like to see Atletico Madrid's Simeone go in there. I know his mate (Andrea Berta) has gone to Arsenal, but I think he would just create havoc, good havoc.",
      "\"I think he would rock up to that place and say 'this is how you do things'. There is no guarantee but I'd just like to see his personality there with his track record.",
      "\"People may say about the style of football, but they beat Real Madrid and scored five. This idea that he is defensive, he doesn't like his team giving up goals and chances, but he can play a bit.",
      "\"They have that fighting spirit, he's on the sidelines causing [havoc]. I like a big personality. Andrea Berta was a big part of the success at Atletico with the recruitment side of it.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Scholes provided a contrasting view when appearing on The Overlap's Fan Debate earlier this week and reckons that Newcastle United's Eddie Howe should be given the nod.",
      "Howe took over from Steve Bruce as Newcastle's head coach following the Saudi-backed takeover in 2021 and has since delivered outstanding results on Tyneside, turning them from a side battling relegation into one that is competing for - and claiming - silverware whilst securing Champions League qualification.",
      "\"Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe,\" Scholes declared. \"I'm not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Sir Jim Ratcliffe shared his thoughts on Amorim's prospects and backed the manager, insisting that he is willing to grant the Portuguese boss three more years to demonstrate his worth.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he revealed to The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times. When questioned about Amorim's tenure, Ratcliffe responded: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's loyalty to Ruben Amorim may well be admirable, but if he is indeed ready to give the Portuguese three years to turn things around at Manchester United, then you have to question his blind faith.",
      "But, in all honesty, far more baffling was the United co-owner's comparison not just to Sir Alex Ferguson, but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.",
      "Fergie took five years to get things right at Old Trafford. He duly turned the club into England's best, making them one of the most successful in world football in the process. However, that was then. The 1980s and early 1990s. Things were very, very different.",
      "Then, during his interview with The Business Podcast, he also revealed he's comparing Amorim's current difficulties with the start of Arteta's spell in North London.",

      "Only it doesn't quite stack up. Arteta took over in December 2019. At the end of his first season, he won the FA Cup. That was a game-changer.",
      "Amorim blew his chance to do something similar in the Europa League final back in May. Amorim's misery saw him take United to their worst ever Premier League finish. Arteta's so-called misery featured silverware. It's hardly comparable.",
      "After that trophy success, Arteta's following season went anything but to plan. He was probably kept in his job by Covid, because Arsenal were a mess and their home form was atrocious. Had fans been allowed to attend, he might well have been out the door.",
      "But then-director of football Edu gave him a vote of confidence, Arteta could always point to the FA Cup as proof that he could get things right, and in 2022-23, they were suddenly unlikely title challengers - backed by a very supportive board and a lot of money spent - and got themselves back in the Champions League.",
      "He hasn't won the Premier League, finishing twice three seasons running. Arsenal fans are divided on him, believing he must deliver a big trophy this season. The club's hierarchy back him 100 percent.",
      "Whereas, United fans have been so supportive on Amorim. They chant his name and are showing an unbelievable amount of patience. That patience has been tested lately.",
      "Ratcliffe and United have also splashed the cash and backed him in the market. They have bought a whole new forward line - Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - to suit the system from which he refuses to deviate.",
      "That’s some show of faith. And, in truth, I really admire it. But you cannot compare the current predicament to where Arsenal were. As one United fan said to me: “We’re nowhere near where Arsenal or Liverpool were in that first five years.”",
      "Amorim is young and relatively inexperienced, like Arteta was. But he is also proving to be very inflexible. He talks well but his players are clearly not buying into or grasping his tactics and vision.",
      "I thought United could battle for the top four this season after their big summer spending. The team has obvious flaws (the midfield for a start), but the squad is decent.",
      "However, again, they're underperforming massively and I'm not sure about Amorim. Nor am I sure that anyone can stomach three years of this soap opera",
      "And the idea you can give him three years to get it right… well, I just don’t think anyone there's even a remote chance of that happening unless there's a huge uptick in results very, very soon.",

      "\"You have absolutely no chance of someone stopping to talk,\" said the security guard who escorted players from the dressing room following Manchester United's defeat to Brentford.",
      "The general rule is United players are reluctant to speak to reporters in the mixed zone after a defeat, and the security guard's prediction looked set to come true until Matthijs de Ligt agreed to stop for a chat.",
      "De Ligt reiterated the players must take responsibility for their performances and cut out individual mistakes. \"He is playing well,\" another staff member remarked of the centre back when he got on the bus.",
      "The Dutchman was not included in the United leadership group that was formed in the summer, but he is understood to have taken on a leadership role in the dressing room regardless.",
      "Not everyone in the United dressing room has the character to front up in difficult moments.",
      "Fans wonder are the players hurting like us? Do they see what we are watching? Taking a few minutes to speak after a game is an opportunity for players to influence the narrative around a result.",
      "Having said that, it's understandable why players often decline interviews when they leave a stadium. Sometimes they have not played well and want to escape any further spotlight. They are human.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to understand why a player is more willing to speak when they are performing well - and that is partly why De Ligt has been one of the dressing room's voices.",
      "He has quietly been one of the standout performers this season. There isn't stiff competition, given United's poor start to the campaign, but he is one of the few individuals to emerge with credit.",
      "The 26-year-old has started every Premier League game and has delivered consistently strong displays, making important clearances and interceptions at the back.",
      "So, it was surprising to see De Ligt dropped from the Netherlands squad for the October international break, a decision that Ronald Koeman admitted wasn't easy to make.",
      "Netherlands boss Koeman said: “That sometimes makes my head hurt, because of the central defenders I sometimes have to drop. That’s the least enjoyable part of my job. I have a lot of contact with Matthijs, he’s also a guy who asks for feedback, about what he needs to do to be included.”",
      "De Ligt was included in the Netherlands squad for the September international break for their games against Poland and Lithuania, but he was an unused substitute against the former.",
      "Jan Paul van Hecke (Brighton) and Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) started against Poland, while Koeman started Van Dijk alongside Stefan de Vrij (Inter Milan) in the clash against Lithuania.",
      "The Netherlands have talent in central defence, but should De Ligt be behind Van Hecke or De Vrij on current form? His omission from the Dutch squad this month seems an unfair decision from Koeman.",
      "It's no wonder that De Ligt sought feedback about his omission from the squad, although the Netherlands' loss is United's gain, as he is more likely to return from the international break injury-free.",
      "De Ligt will be impossible to ignore if he continues to perform as he is for United.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he will give under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim time to prove he is the right man for the job.",
      "Amorim has endured a nightmare first year in charge of United and has twice offered to resign if Ratcliffe and the rest of the hierarchy felt it was in the best interests of the club.",
      "But United co-owner Ratcliffe, in control of football operations at the club, hailed the 40-year-old head coach as a “good guy” who deserved to be judged over the length of his three-year deal.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” said Ratcliffe. “Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "“That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.”",
      "Asked what would happen if United majority owners the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe dismissed the notion and said: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "Under Amorim, United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, their lowest finish for half a century, and failed to qualify for Europe for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "Amorim has only managed to win 37 points from a possible 102 and remains under pressure, despite a much-needed 2-0 win over Sunderland last weekend which moved United up to 10th.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will already know his starting line-up for the trip to arch rivals Liverpool a week on Sunday.",
      "Injuries permitting, which is always the concern when players are released for international duty, Amorim knows the personnel he will deploy at Anfield as he seeks back-to-back league wins for the first time since taking charge nearly a year ago.",
      "United's 2-0 win over Sunderland has given Amorim the template to go to the home of the reigning champions and try to secure a first victory at Anfield since a Wayne Rooney strike secured a 1-0 win there back in 2016.",
      "In goal, there is no reason to change Senne Lammens after the 23-year-old's assured debut against Sunderland, which had United fans chanting “Are you Schmeichel in disguise?” given how well he commanded his area and repelled everything thrown at him.",
      "For his back three, Amorim must go with Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw, just as he did against the Black Cats. Shaw may not have been as impressive as Yoro and De Ligt this season, not least in the defeats to Manchester City and Brentford, but he is the best option on the left side of defence and brings balance to the back three, not to mention experience of hostile atmospheres like Anfield.",
      "Amorim's midfield four at Anfield will surely be Amad on the right, Casemrio and Bruno Fernandes in the middle, with Diogo Dalot operating at left wing-back. Patrick Dorgu started the Sunderland win on the bench, coming for Dalot in the second-half, and there seems little reason for Amorim to change that around, given the latter offers more than the former, offensively and defensively.",
      "United skipper Fernandes may not be at his marauding best in the deeper midfield role to which Amorim has assigned him this season, but he will remain there for the time being and the team will need his energy and omnipresence to achieve some semblance of control against Arne Slot's side, who have suffered three successive defeats and are therefore uncharacteristically vulnerable.",
      "Mason Mount has played his way into the starting line-up, at the expense of Matheus Cunha, following his goal-scoring, all-action display against Sunderland, which offered a timely reminder of his enduring quality and value when he is fully fit, which has been all too rare during his two years at United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will also maintain his record of starting every Premier League game since his £71m move from Brentford, given the immediate impact he has made since joining and the different dimension he brings to the attack, with his pace, physicality and dangerous runs in behind defences.",
      "Up front, 6ft 4in fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko has settled in after a slow start and will be looking for his third goal in as many games against Liverpool. The Slovenia striker has grown into the role of leading United's attack and Amorim will be looking for him to make sure he is a handful for Liverpool's defenders in a game the Reds must now believe they can win.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",

      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",

      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘in discussions’ with Harry Maguire’s representatives over a contract extension, but former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo could yet throw a spanner in the works.",
      "Having been stripped of the captain’s armband under Erik ten Hag, Maguire was reinstated to United’s new leadership by Ruben Amorim in the summer, alongside Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton.",
      "United triggered the one-year extension in Maguire’s contract over the summer, but he will be free to talk to foreign clubs in January if a new deal isn’t agreed.",
      "It’s claimed Maguire’s preference is to stay at Old Trafford having been handed increased responsibility under Amorim, who values the centre-back’s leadership qualities, but Saudi clubs are also interested.",
      "Maguire will likely have to accept a pay cut if he’s to remain at United, which surely wouldn’t be the case if he upped sticks to Saudi Arabia, where both Al-Ettifaq and Al-Nassr are keen.",
      "Former teammate Ronaldo is now involved in Al-Nassr transfers and could push the club to make a move for Maguire, either in January or the summer.",
      "Addressing his contract situation and the one-year extension which was triggered, Maguire said: “The clause was in their hands, so there was no option for me there. There was no talking. It was just that they activated it, and it got extended. This year, obviously I’m up at the end of the year.",
      "“I’m pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can’t leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",

      "“Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and what I want to be. I don’t want to put it out there to everybody, but it’s an amazing club to play for and you’d be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.”",
      "There have once again been rumours that Fernandes could also make the switch to Saudi Arabia, but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has dismissed that anything “concrete” has yet been decide over the Man Utd midfielder’s future.",
      "He said: “Nothing at all at the moment. His full focus is on United. A new deal was signed one year ago, so nothing concrete has happened at this stage. The Saudis remain interested as they’ve been for the last three years, but there’s nothing else now.”",

      "Roy Keane has named a manager who would “create havoc” as his preferred option replace under-fire Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and Gary Neville is in full agreement.",
      "Amorim is under pressure at Old Trafford having picked up just 37 points in his 34 Premier League games as United boss.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who hired Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag last year, moved to relieve the pressure on the Portuguese boss on Wednesday.",
      "Having insisted the Glazers family – who still hold the majority of shares in the club – asking him to sack Amorim “isn’t going to happen”, Ratcliffe said he won’t make decisions based on “some journalist who goes off on one”.",
      "He added: “The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed Amorim is “a good guy”, before implying he’s set to lead United for a long time yet.",
      "“He has not had the best of seasons,” he admitted. “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Man Utd ‘sale to new investor’ at ‘advanced stage’ as Saudi chief aims dig at Glazers, Ratcliffe\n👉 Premier League CRISIS Rankings: Forest 2nd, West Ham 3rd, but what of Liverpool and Man Utd?\n👉 Ruben Amorim has three weeks, not three years, to prove himself to Ratcliffe",
      "Despite Ratcliffe’s vote of confidence, pundits continue to speculate over who should come in as his replacement.",
      "And after Paul Scholes claimed Eddie Howe should “definitely” be targeted as the next United boss, Keane picked a manager who might just be the antithesis of the measured Newcastle man.",
      "“I’ve said it for years,” he said on The Overlap’s Stick to Football podcast.",
      "“I’d like to see, I’d like Atletico Madrid, [Diego] Simeone [to] go in there. I’d like to see him go in there.",
      "“I know his mate’s gone to Arsenal, but I think he would just create a havoc, but good havoc. I think he’d rock up to that place and say, ‘This is how you do things.’",
      "“No guarantee, but I just like to see his personality, even his track record.”",
      "Simeone has been manager of Atletico Madrid since 2011, winning five major trophies including two La Liga titles, in 2013/14 and 2020/2021.",
      "He’s part of the fabric of that football club, but Gary Neville agreed that if United can lure him away, he would be the best bet for United.",
      "“I think I’d go with that. I’d go with Simeone,” Neville added.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments have inevitably brought division to a Mailbox that includes talk of ‘delusion’ among us ‘sissy left-wing’ types.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "We cannot yet, unfortunately, move on from the Gary Neville moral panic because the Daily Mail are still being entirely ridiculous about it.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "There are some silly Liverpool messages and agreements but the big problem is the MailOnline’s atrocious reporting of that Gary Neville ‘outburst’."

      "Ratcliffe now holds a 29 per cent stake in United having taken control of football operations at Old Trafford in February 2024.",
      "The Glazers remain the majority owners having rejected a takeover bid by Sheikh Jassim’s Qatari consortium when they sold their shares to Ratcliffe for £1.25bn last year.",
      "Al-Sheikh is chairman of the General Entertainment Authority and having owned Egyptian club Pyramids from 2018 to 2019 and Spanish club Almería from 2019 to May 2025, is now responsible for bringing some of the highest-profile sporting events to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He’s currently in talks with United over their participation in the Riyadh Season Cup, a three-way tournament against the capital’s two biggest clubs, Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal, which featured Inter Miami in February.",
      "And after those reported discussions he dropped a bombshell on X, hitting out at the Red Devils owners in the process.",
      "He wrote: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "There’s no other evidence of either the Glazers or Ratcliffe looking to sell their stakes despite the raft of mistakes Ratcliffe has been criticised for since he took charge of the football at Old Trafford, including cutting jobs and ending free lunches for staff, which he insists were necessary in his bid to put United on a “firm financial footing”.",
      "“The costs were just too high,” Ratcliffe told The Business podcast. “There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.",
      "“There are two halves to a football team – there is the business side and the sports side. The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor – is profitability.",
      "“The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build. It’s like a Formula One car – the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be.",
      "“So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "“If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We’re not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we’ve done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "“Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe says it will take Ruben Amorim three years to prove himself, but getting through a perilous three weeks should earn the Man Utd boss more than a ...",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has opened up on the future of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and his relationship with the Glazer family.",

      "We’ve done mood rankings. We’ve done manager rankings. But we see now that was only ever building up to this moment. Everything has been leading to this. The Crisis Rankings. Or CRISIS Rankings, because it does feel like this important and serious work merits a tiny bit of panicked ALL CAPS headloss.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League, anyway. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure we could do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy. But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) as the barren wasteland of a dreary international break stretches out endlessly before us all, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Here, then, are the inaugural F365 Crisis Rankings, ranked from least to most crisis-ridden (which we’re pretty sure you could have worked out for yourselves).",
      "",
      "There absolutely are clubs for whom crisis talk can and does begin when a 19-match, trophy-winning unbeaten run comes to an end via a scrappy late goal at Everton. Crystal Palace are not one of those clubs.",
      "They probably aren’t going to do a Leicester after all. We’ll tell the children etc. but while a bit of a shame it is no crisis.",
      "Still if anything just about as far from crisis as it’s possible to be, at least until they lose two defenders to injury and/or a Glasner-enraging January transfer.",
      "READ: Everton spare Liverpool blushes but not Wirtz’s as huge Crystal Palace weakness laid bare",
      "",
      "A club all too familiar with crisis in recent years but currently well above all that kind of thing, thank you very much. They’ve got themselves a perfect new hero in Jack Grealish and have thus far made the awkward jump to a new ground and new surroundings look pretty straightforward indeed.",
      "Don’t look at all like they’re liable to get themselves into any real bother at all this season. Look far more likely to actually be proper good fun. Long-suffering Everton fans will still have the automatic defence response of expecting the worst at any moment, but honestly guys it’s all absolutely fine here isn’t it? Just enjoy it, would be our advice.",
      "There’s even a decent chance you might get to laugh at Liverpool quite a bit. And that’s been a while.",
      "",
      "Seems deeply quaint now, given the sheer depth and breadth of the assorted CRISIS levels now beleaguering other clubs up and down the country, but if you cast your mind back into the deep, distant past of about a fortnight ago you’ll remember that Arsenal were themselves quite deep in crisis. Because of the handbrake.",
      "Specifically, the handbrake that silly old Mikel Arteta refused to release in games against Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "Said handbrake has since been released in games against Newcastle and West Ham which, coupled with Liverpool’s own seven-stages-of-crisis descent, has allowed Arsenal to go top of the table.",
      "And now they have every chance of opening up a really tidy lead from some kindly fixtures between the October and November interlulls having had to wade through some distinctly unpleasant games in August and September.",
      "Obviously Arsenal are Arsenal and thus can never be entirely crisis-free. There are two main pillars in the current attempts to paint the current favourites to the win the Premier League and Champions League as still mired in some kind of crisis.",
      "One was the really quite insane response to Arsenal maintaining their 100% Champions League record this season with a 2-0 win over Olympiacos, an event that was covered by our brave press with the kind of gravity normally reserved for the passing of a minor royal.",
      "The other crisis pillar for Arsenal – and this is one that only the winning of actual trophies will quell – is the Arsenally factor. They have a great opportunity here, but what if they just Arsenal it up?",
      "Related to this – a sub-pillar, if you will – is the fact they also really don’t like being called favourites. Because it inevitably invites subsequent accusations of bottling.",
      "And there really is no way out of this maze for Arsenal until, like their near neighbours, they manage to shut the talk down with an actual trophy. Because until then, the ridiculous reality of the noise around this most noise-generating of modern clubs is that the two things that can lead them to crisis town are a) good football results and b) bad football results. And celebrating wrong, obviously. Always with the celebrating wrong.",
      "",
      "We thought there would be a crisis. By rights there should have been a crisis. When you sell four of your back five to assorted big buggers, a crisis seems inevitable.",
      "But Andoni Iraola and Antoine Semenyo have had other ideas. Accepting the inevitable for the defence but holding firm on Semenyo is already looking like inspired pragmatic real-world transfer market realism from the Cherries. There’s a real skill for clubs in their situation in knowing when and where to fold and when to hold.",
      "Iraola still feels like the real genius behind all this, though. Thanking Gary O’Neil for his sterling work in keeping Bournemouth in the Premier League after they’d been Scott Parkered and moving him on to bring in Iraola must now go down as one of the biggest and most significant upgrades made by a member of the ‘Small 14’.",
      "As long as he remains in place, Bournemouth will be fine. Which does invite us to ponder the inevitable problem somewhere down the line. As wiser football minds than ours have opined: it is what it is.",
      "",
      "We are very, very suspicious of this Tottenham start. We’re not actually at all convinced they’re really any good at all, but we also have a sneaking feeling that they may get away with it far more often than not and end up very much in and around the top-four picture despite themselves.",
      "Also wouldn’t really be shocked at all if they’re 11th by the New Year. We’re keeping our options very much open here.",
      "We do think that a summer of upheaval could have ended up much, much worse for Spurs. For all the banterous nature of the Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze pursuits and their humiliating conclusions, Spurs have ended up…okay.",
      "They’ve strengthened the areas they needed to strengthen and without yet being entirely convincing are already reaping the benefits. That Leeds game was an absolutely perfect example of precisely the sort of game they would have wilted and lost last season in the face of a physical and psychological test.",
      "The simple fact that Spurs have won every game in which they’ve led this season is immensely encouraging given how p*ss-poor they were by that metric last year, and while it’s reasonable to ask questions about how precisely they got themselves into the pickles they did against Brighton or Wolves or Bodo/Glimt it must also be acknowledged that they found a way to at least get some of the way back out of them. That is not a trait one immediately associates with Spurs.",
      "Joao Palhinha may provoke grumbling among some Spurs purists for his no-nonsense game but he is exactly the player for which they have been crying out to have in their midfield for some time now. There’s a fight and steel about Spurs now, a willingness and acceptance that sometimes in this league you are going to have to earn your right to play.",
      "That Thomas Frank is also managing to get some decent output from encouraging Palhinha into more forward positions is also good news, suggesting a flexibility and thoughtfulness to both coach and player that is welcome at a club where things can get very dogmatic. We’re still very hopeful that Xavi Simons will eventually get up to the speed of things when given a run of games in a more settled role, and Mohammed Kudus is already looking far more like the season-one West Ham version than season-two.",
      "We’re not quite sure exactly how Spurs have only lost one game this season, but they have, and they’ve got themselves into a tidy position in three competitions. They are still Spurs, they will always be Spurs and they can always go fully and entirely Spurs, but right now there is no crisis here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland will be disappointed not to have come away from Manchester United with something. The very fact this is a sentence you can write with an entirely straight face tells you things are going pretty well for the Black Cats on the back of what looked for all the world like a dangerously premature promotion back to the big league.",
      "But an expert summer of recruitment from a transfer net cast far and wide has given them every chance. At the very, very least they won’t be getting relegated without a damn good fight and that is all one can reasonably ask of unexpected play-off winners when coming into the Premier League, really.",
      "Notable too that all their points have come against the established and settled Premier League set. There is nothing artificial or obviously deceptive about a set of results including wins over West Ham, Brentford and Forest alongside points against Palace and Villa. Those are results that indicate Sunderland are precisely what they currently appear to be: a perfectly capable mid-table Premier League side.",
      "Still a genuinely incredible effort if they can keep that up for another seven months, but now no reason really to think otherwise.",
      "",
      "Not currently in crisis, but definitely still on a crisis watchlist. The summer was hard and unpleasant for Newcastle, dominated as it was in the end by the Isak Saga and the great and at one time potentially never-ending quest for a replacement.",
      "They spent an awful lot of money on Nick Woltemade and it did have about it a whiff of desperation, but Newcastle was a club desperate for a new hero and he already has the look and air and most importantly goals of a man heading for beloved cult status at a place that loves its big number nines. We think everyone loves big number nines, really, but Newcastle definitely love big number nines.",
      "Results are on a general upward trend despite the late p*sser against Arsenal, and the fixture list for the month between October and November interlulls doesn’t look too bad at all either domestically or in the Champions League.",
      "Late November and into December look like potentially choppier waters, though, where keen crisis watchers might just need a close eye on Eddie Howe and the lads.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when everything was definitely going all 2024/25 after back-to-back defeats against Tottenham and Brighton plunged a new-look Manchester City and their manager into clear crisis territory.",
      "They’ve since escaped that talk for now by not losing any more games, and winning most of them thanks to Erling Haaland scoring quite simply all the goals. We’ve even seen the team and manager that has won six of the last eight Premier League titles described as ‘dark horses’ to make that seven out of nine, which is quite funny given all the information in that sentence and the fact they are currently trailing by three whole points.",
      "Perhaps the speed with which City have proved that all the talk of crisis after a couple of bad results might have been a bit much, and maybe we should learn something from that about the whole idea of deciding who is and isn’t in crisis at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Reader, my friend, we haven’t learned a thing.",
      "",
      "Impressively not in crisis despite losing so much in the summer and taking the high-risk continuity option of entrusting their precious yet deceptively precarious Premier League status to a novice in Keith Andrews.",
      "So far, it’s okay. Better, even. The high points have been very high. Victories over Villa in both league and Carabao, with the best of the lot clearly a thoroughly deserved win over Manchester United. Even managed to get the defeat to Nottingham Forest out of the way early enough for people not to realise how embarrassing that now is.",
      "And, in general, the bad moments – defeats at Fulham and Sunderland as well as Forest have been sufficiently spread out that they don’t command attention. There’s always been another good day round the corner soon enough.",
      "When you’re Brentford, that’s enough. They’re like a Reverse Man United. There, under the spotlight, it takes multiple good results to wash away the effect of the bad, while for Brentford it takes a proper run of bad results for people to forget taking four points off Chelsea and Man United, just as a for instance.",
      "What we still fear is that such a run of bad results really could be just around the corner. It still feels very precarious; they’ve coped admirably with losing the guiding hand of Thomas Frank but it still feels like a club where a minor wobble could become worrying and before you know it, you fear for them, you really do.",
      "December feels like it’s the key month for Brentford given the spread of games they’ve got during that always crucial and busy time. They play Spurs both home and away that month in obviously narrative-heavy games as well as Arsenal away and Bournemouth at home. Throw in a couple of potential six-pointers against Leeds and Wolves and you’ve got the perfect lab conditions for a crisis.",
      "Or you take the optimistic alternative, where the perfect conditions to create a crisis must by definition offer the opportunity to thoroughly dispel the notion altogether.",
      "",
      "A reminder of how restorative a bit of Thursday night Europaball can be for a troubled club. Doesn’t always work and can definitely make things even worse (see Forest, Nottingham) but Villa aren’t the first team who’ve managed to inject a bit of life into a season turning toward the dreary thanks to some Thursday evening respite.",
      "Having failed to win any of their first five Premier League games – failing even to score in the first four of them – and gone out of the Carabao on penalties to Brentford, Villa have now got themselves into a four-match winning run thanks to home league results against Fulham and Burnley to go with a pair of Euro victories.",
      "It’s all feeling much better now than it did a few weeks ago, when it really did feel like we were approaching the end of a bold, often brilliant, but ultimately doomed attempt to re-insert Villa into the elite of English and European football.",
      "We’re still quite a long way from last season’s Icarus-like highs as they soared so close to the sun on wings fashioned from unsustainable wages, but it’s a lot better than it was after failing to hold on to a lead against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "We also very much reserve the right to reassess this reassessing of Villa’s Crisis Levels at the next international break, because they have perhaps the most troubling run of intra-interlull games of anyone. Their four league games in that time are all against teams currently in the top five: Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Already shaping up to be their magnificent scampish big-boy-bothering selves this season. They’ve taken seven points from three games against Man City, Tottenham and Chelsea, and two points from four games against Fulham, Everton, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "That remains in the ‘irritating’ rather than ‘crisis’ territory for now, but isn’t a trend you want to deepen too carelessly in what looks like being a particularly competitive season for those who’ve grown accustomed to easy and comfortable survival in the last couple of straight up, straight down seasons for promoted clubs.",
      "We would very much like to see them continue their policy of winning Carabao games 6-0 away from home when they travel to Arsenal in the next round. Sure, some people might contend that winning 6-0 at Arsenal is harder than doing so at Oxford or Barnsley but as far as we’re concerned that’s loser talk. Aim high, always. Especially when you’re Brighton and as a general rule apparently prefer playing good teams.",
      "",
      "Feels like Leeds were very close to serious crisis levels after botching the last days and hours of the transfer window, leaving themselves pretty short of attacking weaponry and prompting plenty of chat that a decent shot at survival had been squandered.",
      "They’re doing perfectly well, though, and have even started scoring goals. Since being ultimately outclassed at Arsenal – which is fair enough – they’ve been competitive with everyone and while their games against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Spurs may only have yielded two points in total they all showed that Leeds are perfectly capable of mixing it with decent teams.",
      "It certainly doesn’t feel particularly crisis-y right now, even if Bournemouth’s last-gasp equaliser and the lack of reward for a very decent performance against Spurs are a bit annoying.",
      "There is, though, perhaps no club outside the Big Six that faces a more defining period between these two upcoming international breaks. Leeds already occupy an unusual space in that their size as a club doesn’t quite tally with their status as a newly-promoted team, but it’s a fascinating run of games they’ve got coming up over the next five weeks or so.",
      "Before we all take another unwanted rest for the November break, Leeds will face Burnley, West Ham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest. That is a set of fixtures to conjure with. It screams crisitunity. These are all games that should sit pretty high on target fixtures in Leeds’ survival roadmap, given what we’ve seen from all of them so far.",
      "But at the same time three of those games are away from Elland Road. A month from now we could be looking at Leeds sitting loftily and confidently clear of the squabbling and bickering down at the bottom. Or if things haven’t gone quite to plan they could be right in there getting filthy with the rest of them.",
      "",
      "Almost impressive to be a London club and attract as little attention as Fulham. It can work both way but currently means that the only real response to successive 3-1 defeats at Aston Villa and Bournemouth has been to note that Marco Silva looked magnificent standing in the south-coast rain.",
      "No crisis. Might just be the beginnings of one after they’ve played Arsenal and Newcastle, though.",
      "",
      "A keen example of how finely balanced the see-saw can be between crisis and not-crisis. There’s no doubt that, overall, Chelsea’s results have been inadequate given all that talk in the summer – mainly from us, sure – that they ought to be title contenders now.",
      "But also… they absolutely should be title contenders, shouldn’t they? Enzo Maresca can’t keep playing the “Little old us? Title challengers, aw shucks!” when they’ve spent the GDP of a small nation on wingers and Brighton players over the last few years.",
      "Chelsea’s defeats have been eye-catchingly bad. Outclassed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, mugged off again by Brighton late on in the Premier League and – most shaming of all – managing out-stupid Manchester United at Old Trafford. A feat of such crisis-inducing magnitude it’s almost impressive.",
      "They also made uncomfortably hard work of negotiating Lincoln in the Carabao. They also did all those things in the space of four consecutive games.",
      "They are, in short, neither the first nor surely last Big Six club to find themselves grateful that whatever daft things they might be getting up to are being overshadowed to some degree by the dafter things Manchester United are getting up to.",
      "And the response to that run of a win that felt like a defeat and three defeats that felt like… even worse defeats has been undeniably impressive. Survived a meeting with the Special One in the Champions League and then of course lessened their own crisis ratings while deepening Liverpool’s on Saturday evening.",
      "They’ve nudged clear of the deepest crisis alerts but certainly aren’t out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "It is perhaps an indicator of just how low the bar has become for promoted teams now that four points from seven games, with the only win against another promoted club, isn’t drawing more attention towards Scott Parker and his team.",
      "In fairness, it’s also because Burnley did have an undeniably horrible start. Four of those seven games have been against members of the Big Six. And while all have been lost and two of them – against Spurs and City – heavily, there were huge reasons for encouragement amidst the agony of going down to late, late penalties against both Man United and Liverpool.",
      "So no crisis yet, but if they don’t register a win in one of their next two games against Leeds and Wolves it will be an uncomfortably antsy and potentially bottom-three-marooned team that welcomes Arsenal to Turf Moor early next month.",
      "",
      "Looks a lot like a crisis right now, sure, but we’re not worried. Wolves do this a lot. It’s a crisis for Vitor Pereira, definitely, because he might have to be sacrificed, but Wolves making a terrible start to the season and then ending up 14th in May after taking 30 points in the second half of the season and saying ‘What were you worried about?’",
      "They’ll be fine, but Pereira might unfortunately have to play his part by being unceremoniously sacked when they’re six points adrift of safety in mid-December.",
      "Sergio Conceicao, if you’re interested, is our pick as the man to steer Wolves to safety in impressive style, prompting confidence of a much better campaign in 25/26, only to sit 19th after losing eight of their first 10 games and having to be replaced by someone else to continue a perpetual cycle that will outlast us all.",
      "",
      "What a crash course in Barclays that is for Arne Slot, by the way. Hailed as a calm and quiet genius for delivering the title with a settled squad in his first season. Pretty much handed a second title after winning five games on the trot at the start of his second season.",
      "And now, after an admittedly quite ropey fortnight that has seen Liverpool plummet from the very summit of the Premier League all the way down to second place and one whole point behind the new leaders, he is as bald and fraudulent as any Premier League manager has ever been. And those are some high levels of bald fraudulence.",
      "His tactics are being questioned. His selections, his signings – even though they aren’t really his signings – his substitutions. Everything.",
      "The man who delivered only Liverpool’s second league title since the invention of football, and who was pretty much being handed a second by a league apparently collectively bending the knee just two weeks ago, now finds himself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race.",
      "Of course the CRISIS talk around Liverpool is completely insane. But perhaps only Arsenal can rival Liverpool when it comes to a completely unhinged, overwrought and overplayed narrative. The good times are always the very best ever, but that means the lows are met with the same levels of wild overreaction.",
      "Still, though. Definitely feels true that something’s not quite right here, doesn’t it? Definitely not a Liverpool – or Slot – with the same quiet unfussed equilibrium that steered them so calmly through last season. We’re perhaps all already guilty of forgetting both how easily Liverpool won the title and how unexpected that actually was at the start of the season and based on the club’s Premier League history.",
      "They were so good, so quickly under Slot that it became normalised and perhaps even underappreciated.",
      "But that calm authority hasn’t been there this season. There’s been a madcap, desperate nature to Liverpool’s performances that was every bit as much present in their late wins as it has been in their late defeats.",
      "The late goals that have swung so many Liverpool games all bore the Hallmark of Champions™ when going in at the right end, so it’s only fair to ask what they have now they’ve started going in at the other.",
      "Of course, once again, we’re in territory where both are overplayed.",
      "But we nevertheless find ourselves already building up for what suddenly looks like an epic Liverpool-Man United clash on the other side of the international break, one where the loser will be unavoidably and inevitably plunged into a deep and lasting crisis.",
      "Is it accurate, fair, funny or clever to call that game El Crisico? Absolutely not. Is there even the slightest chance that will stop us? Absolutely not.",
      "",
      "Things will, one suspects, eventually calm down a bit under Nuno Espirito Santo but it’s a smaller, quieter, reduced West Ham now, ambition and joy squeezed and squashed into a grim fight for perpetual Premier League survival where there is no greater or larger long-term purpose.",
      "Maybe they’ll have the odd cup run. Maybe another season in Europe here or there. But it all just feels colourless and drab. They’re still in crisis, but it’s a boring and bland crisis. West Ham don’t even get entertaining crises now.",
      "Just all very dispiriting. And worst of all, ceding everything they stand for in the name of drab, colourless survival and the growing apathy of the fans inside their drab, colourless bowl of a stadium might not even work.",
      "The crisis might yet become very colourful indeed.",
      "",
      "You better believe that’s a crisis. It’s been an absolute masterclass in crisis creation, an almost entirely self-created and self-inflicted crisis full of dick-swinging and egos and very stupid men doing very stupid things for very stupid reasons.",
      "Even if you accept the shaky premise that Nuno was developing ideas above his station and getting too argumentative with the all-powerful transfer guru Edu, then deciding to replace him during the season with about the single most philosophically diverging manager imaginable was and remains a choice.",
      "It has now reached a point where sacking that manager after seven winless games might actually be less of a mad piece of behaviour than appointing him in the first place.",
      "And while the sheer speed and scale of the unravelling might be graver than expected, it can’t really be claimed with any real credibility by anyone involved that this sort of outcome was not just possible but probable. Sure, maybe seven months felt more likely than seven weeks, but it just never looked like it could or should work.",
      "If it didn’t work at Spurs with the squad profile they possessed – and in the Premier League, for about a year and a half, it very much did not work – how was it ever going to succeed for Forest’s squad with no time to adapt or adjust.",
      "To their credit, the players really seem to have bought into it. There are no tools being downed here, and it’s further evidence of just how beguiling and inspiring a speaker Ange Postecoglou is. We remain entirely convinced that he can propel people to achieve things they never thought possible. He got Spurs players to win a f*cking trophy, for crying out loud.",
      "But we’re just not at all convinced he can be a consistently successful Premier League football manager, and a club without the insulating protection provided by Big Six status – which still might not have been enough for Spurs in a more routine Premier League season without three catastrophically ill-equipped promoted sides – taking a gamble on him was just thoroughly reckless.",
      "What might save him for a while is a truly joyless and uninspiring list of potential replacements, but that’s of no use to Forest fans right now. Graham Potter being the latest name linked provokes a very different reaction now than it would have a few years ago. Brutal game, football.",
      "",
      "Of course they are in crisis. They have been pretty much permanently in crisis since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and he is, in his own way, one of the men most responsible for the fact that nobody else can match the impossible standards that became the norm across two ludicrous decades.",
      "The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can concoct a plausible answer, is not “Are Man United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, imaginably sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to those outrageous levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the 90s and 00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they just drift further and further from it.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but this continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have managed to win two games in a row at least once is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "‘The last thing Thomas Tuchel wants is for outsiders to stir up tensions,’ writes a man doing exactly that with Jude Bellingham.",

      "If Ruben Amorim was expecting to hear from Sir Jim Ratcliffe during the current international break, he would have feared something rather bleaker than this…",
      "“Ruben is a good guy.” the United part-owner told The Business podcast. “He has not had the best of seasons. But he needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.”",
      "Compared to what Amorim might have expected post-Brentford, that’s a hug and squeeze. But the United boss will recognise lip-service by now. Three weeks, not three years, is the worry that will deprive him of yet more sleep while many of his players are doing their national service.",
      "Amorim is living international break to international break right now. He spared himself prior to the last one with a 97th-minute home win over Burnley in the wake of Grimsby-gate. In this latest three-week audition for his own job, Amorim won two, lost two, the odd signs of encouragement mixed with some familiar failings.",
      "United disproved little of what we already know of them, swaying no-one from the firmly entrenched positions they already held, leaving Amorim and Ratcliffe to kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way a little longer until the one-year anniversary of his appointment draws nearer.",
      "That milestone is more of worry for Amorim than a cause for celebration. Reports suggest United will be liable for a much smaller pay-off if they wait 12 months before sacking another manager. Amid Ratcliffe’s quest to make United the most profitable circus football club in the world, every million quid counts.",
      "For Amorim, there is little respite to be found in the fixture list. Like the last four-game block, United will face two of the big six, Liverpool and Tottenham away, with Brighton at Old Trafford and a possible El Sackico at Forest in between. Three away trips is hardly ideal when United’s form on the road is so poor.",
      "Where is the bar for Amorim? Will six points keep him in a job again?",
      "Liverpool have been poor – are they the crisis club? – but surely not so sloppy as to let United win at Anfield for the first time in almost a decade. As Paul Scholes said, a point would be very nice, ta.",
      "Brighton at home. Sheesh. The Seagulls have had United on strings in recent seasons. The Red Devils might have won their last three at Old Trafford but so have Brighton. United have lost seven of the last eight meetings. Three points will be the expectation of Amorim at the Amex North, but none of us could be surprised if United are left looking to make up points elsewhere.",
      "Maybe at Forest? A year to the day since he was appointed, Amorim will go to the City Ground to face a manager for whom beating United in a European final was not enough to keep his job at Tottenham. Forest, perhaps breezier for also sacking Ange Postecoglou by then, could inflict a third defeat on Amorim on the very day it becomes cheaper to sack him.",
      "Should Amorim reach Tottenham before the next international break, there Ratcliffe could see for himself the positive impact of replacing a dogmatic manager with a pragmatist.",
      "MORE: Man Utd isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "If there is a dour tinge to the context above, that’s because pessimism prevails at Old Trafford these days. That six points might be seen as a creditable haul when This Is Manchester United Football Club We Are Talking About tells its own story. Whether half the available points will be enough to save him once more, only Ratcliffe and his cronies can decide.",
      "Whatever verdict they reach, it ought to be with a view beyond the next convenient sacking window. There are many reasons why the mess United find themselves in is not Amorim’s fault, just as there are plenty that make it true that, so far, he has not done enough to turn the Reds around. Ratcliffe, Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada; if they see a clearer picture than the “knee jerk reactions of journalists who go off on one every week”, then enlighten us and be decisive.",

      "Not 24 hours after a 1-0 defeat to Leeds described by goalkeeper and captain Ben Foster as “a battering”, Watford dispensed with Munoz 10 months into his reign after sensing “a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving”.",
      "The Hornets were 14th with seven points from as many games, having beaten Aston Villa; how many managers would they would sack to return to such “a negative trend” four years later?",
      "More. The answer is always more.",
      "Munoz’s longest coaching stint ever remains the 41 games he managed with Slovakian top-flight side Dunajska Streda, with spells at Huesca, Anorthosis, Sheffield Wednesday and ohor Darul Ta’zim hardly suggesting Watford made a glaring error in parting with the manager who had secured automatic promotion so recently.",
      "Ranieri was soon installed, himself only lasting until January before handing over to Roy Hodgson, who barely muddled through until May as Watford suffered a Premier League relegation from which they are yet to recover.",
      "",
      "One of the precious few Premier League managers to be sacked after winning their final game, Farke’s fate was sealed long before Norwich earned their first victory of the season 11 games in. A matter of minutes after conducting post-match media duties having beaten Brentford, the Canaries told the manager that he would be left in the coalmine.",
      "The decision to part with Farke had apparently been made on the morning of the game, regardless of the result. Norwich were bottom after a run of two draws, three goals scored and eight defeats in their first ten matches; they remained rooted to the foot of the table even after the Brentford win.",
      "But the timing was curious. While the international break was an in-built momentum killer anyway, Norwich seemed desperate to crush even the pretence of an hour’s worth of overdue positivity.",
      "It took them another nine days to unsuccessfully pursue Frank Lampard and bring in Dean Smith, who won his first game but only three of the subsequent 26 as Norwich finished precisely where they were when Farke was forced out.",
      "",
      "Norwich’s delay can be explained at least in part by the fact the manager they eventually settled on was busy himself being sacked in the interim.",
      "Smith was regrettably shown the Aston Villa door after five consecutive defeats, the last of which came against Southampton. He remains the only manager to face the same opponent in consecutive Premier League games in the same season, but with different clubs; Norwich beat Saints a fortnight later and Smith went on to force three separate sackings later in the campaign.",
      "It was an undoubted gamble on Villa’s part and many felt Smith had been dealt with harshly, particularly considering Jack Grealish had been sold the summer before. But it seemed as though they nailed the call when Steven Gerrard was brought in from Rangers and immediately oversaw an improvement in results and performances.",
      "Those wheels soon came off and Gerrard did not last a year. In all fairness to Villa, they did alright with their next appointment.",

      "Levy tends to let things stew before bringing them to the boil. In the official statement announcing a parting of the ways with Pochettino after five-and-a-half years together, the chairman said “it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste”.",
      "More than a week after Spurs broke up for international duty following a 1-1 home draw with Sheffield United, the speculation had been that Pochettino faced a ‘make-or-break’ meeting with West Ham on their return. That was instead the dug-out debut of Jose Mourinho in a thrilling win which teased a generational manager-player link-up with Dele.",
      "",
      "The law of averages dictate that most international break Premier League manager sackings would have been meted out by Watford. The proof is in the P45-based pudding served to a succession of coaches at Vicarage Road.",
      "Gracia had taken the Hornets to an 11th-placed finish and the FA Cup final in 2019, but there was a falsity about those seemingly strong foundations: Watford ended the Premier League season losing seven of their last 11 games before being absolutely hammered by Manchester City at Wembley.",
      "It was a warning they failed to heed in the summer, with Gracia authorised to oversee an opening month in which Watford lost three games and drew one before the international break allowed time for pause.",
      "Watford sacked Gracia, brought in Quique Sanchez Flores, sacked Sanchez Flores, brought in Nigel Pearson, sacked Pearson and accepted relegation with Hayden Mullins at the helm.",

A powder keg partnership with the club was always liable to explode and a 2-0 defeat to title-chasing Liverpool at Anfield just happened to light a fuse which would have burned eventually.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "Neville has come in for a lot of stick over the last week with the Daily Mail’s reporting of his comments particularly concerning as they described them as a ‘racist’ outburst.",
      "Despite the former Man Utd and England defender making a wider point condemning “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and urging everyone to unite “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony”, they have predictably been dragged out of context in certain quarters.",
      "Here we have put together nine of the best, worst, and honestly most terrifying views on Neville’s comments this week…",
      "",
      "“In his, obviously, isolated world he lives in, he’s in the kind of ivory tower position of being shuttled into a Sky studio, back behind a wall in whatever sprawling estate he’s got, they’re saying he’s worth between £50m and £70m. People are telling me that Overlap earns all them £20,000 a pop, they’re sponsored by ARNE now so surely ARNE’s going to be delighted with Gary saying that because I would imagine their target audience is white, middle-class men. It’s definitely not fella’s called Jihad, white, middle-class men called Jihad. I can’t imagine there being that many of them around.",
      "“But Gary’s got himself into this virtue signalling nonsense. We have this pillock, Neville, and he’s crossed over with me because as I said to him and Rio last night, I’m more than welcome to debate both of you. Let’s roll for two hours, discuss any topic. Gary sat in a room with me when we did The Edge podcast, you don’t need to be scared of me, but intellectually I think you’ve got a lot to answer for here.",
      "“I don’t think Gary Neville has thought about who are his audience. Because I’m looking at it going, you’ve just said people who like the Union Jack, people who are patriotic to show their country’s flag in, in this instance, the country he’s from and represented 85 times at international level…just factor in if he said somebody with brown skin or somebody with black skin, there’d be an absolute outrage about it.”",
      "The delightful Barton added: “People like this, gaslighting you all the time, saying to you: ‘no, no you’re a racist for thinking that. You’re far right for thinking that.’ There’s a synagogue attacked and we get a f*****g d***head footballer, absolute idiot, whose ar**hole is for rent to the highest bidder.",
      "“If that’s the Qataris, he’ll forget anything to do with human rights to go and take the Qatari money. He is a whore who is open for exploitation as he has shown this weekend with his stupid comments.",
      "“Now, if he was a man of the people, like he says he was, and if he was really in touch with his fanbase or the people that support his shows or his football club or some of his businesses, then he would know middle-aged white men in this country aren’t the problem.",
      "“Sticking a few flags up and being petrified that your daughters or your granddaughters or your wife are going to be accosted in a changing room by an illegal invader is not a f*****g far right position.”",
      "READ: Neville a ‘traitor’ and Postecoglou sack imminent to bafflement of Daily Mail",
      "",
      "“I think it’s astonishing in the wake of an Islamist terror attack that he decides to have a go at middle-aged white men.",
      "“Maybe the middle-aged white men are the ones who worked on minimum wage inside his hotel, I don’t know. I think he’s a champagne socialist and a coward. It’s a dreadful thing to have said.”",
      "Pushed on why Neville is a coward, Jordan went on: “I think the real issue is about radical Islamist extremism and he doesn’t have the balls to call it out for what it is, rather than suggest that challenging our country about what’s happening, he’s insulated from these things.",
      "“He lives in a very rarefied world where his money and privilege has allowed him to live in a gated environment, not have to worry about NHS appointments, doesn’t have to worry about people being attacked in the streets by immigrants that shouldn’t be here in the first place.",
      "“He doesn’t have to worry about these things, so he has the ability to sit there and observe in such a way that insulates himself from it. I think it’s an appalling stance to have taken.",
      "“He’s entitled to his view, he’s entitled to a view. We are quite happy to wave any other flag in this country, whether it’s Palestinian flags, Ukraine flags or any other flag that we feel we’re able to wave.",
      "“But when you’re talking about people in this country that have legitimate concerns and want to have a legitimate value set and push back against what they’re having forced upon them, for Gary Neville to say what he said is the exact embodiment of being a champagne socialist, insulated from the real world and a coward because the real issue is some of the extremism going on in this country.”",
      "",
      "Le Tissier told students at Southampton Solent University: “He’s basically attacked the demographic of people that are paying his wages, which is a bit strange.",
      "“I think it depends on what side of the argument you fall on and whether your side of the argument suits the agenda of the current media.",
      "“Which I think, you know, for the large part is very left leaning, so if you’re slightly right leaning you won’t be given the good graces to make mistakes other people will be given.”",
      "The Southampton legend added: “Yeah, I think they’ll stand by him and support him, yeah",
      "“I mean, they stood by Jamie Carragher when he spat at a young girl out of the back of his car.",
      "“It is not quite as bad as that, so I think Gary’s got a pretty fair argument there if they try and get rid of him.”",
      "",
      "“He’s blaming them for all the division, not some evil, crazed, mad Islamist who went out to kill innocent people.”",
      "Farage added: “I will tell you what, this Gary Neville is so detached from reality, so detached from the average football fan, it is not true.",
      "",
      "“I’m sorry — I know I tell you every week I’m gonna come here and I’m gonna be calm. We’re being told that we’re being turned against each other mainly by angry middle-aged white men who deem it OK to put up flags.",
      "“I’m not gonna sit here and say stick to football, everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but why am I surrounded by people like Neville who have made millions on the back of working-class people — people they’re supposed to represent, people they’re supposed to respect?”",
      "Kyle added: “Does he actually believe that middle-aged white men raising flags is causing division in this country?",
      "“Three hours after those poor, poor Jewish people on Yom Kippur were murdered by that terrorist called Jihad… a protest march not three hours later, not a mile away, with people waving Palestinian flags and shouting obscenities — but Gary Neville wouldn’t mention that, would he?",
      "“But if you stood up and said it’s disgraceful that these people are marching and inciting violence, people like Neville would say, ‘Oh but it’s unfair.’ But it’s alright to attack middle-aged white men.”",
      "Kyle continued: “I tell you what Gary Neville, do two things: take your fortune and give it to every immigrant and every group that you think isn’t treated well in this country — do that, but you won’t, will you?",
      "“Or go and live somewhere, you numpty, where there are immigrants on the streets and where your teenage daughters might not feel safe, rather than behind the gates of your massive mansion in Chester.”",
      "",
      "‘We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer. After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.",
      "‘Neville is the classic case of a celebrity so feted within his own sport that he appears oblivious to anything or anybody who might challenge his world view. Gary Lineker fell into the same trap…",
      "‘Neville is discovering the hard way that views that resonate inside his self-congratulatory pundit bubble often collapse on first contact with reality. Hence why his latest video has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest. Perhaps now he realises that if you are going to posture as the voice of balance and reason, you cannot savage the flying of the Union Flag as divisive and then fail even to mention the Palestine Action protests that took place directly after the Manchester outrage, in defiance of calls to show respect to the Jewish community.",
      "‘It is doubly bizarre that Neville invokes his patriotism with the old “I’ve played 85 times for my country” line. These honours, earned from 1995 to 2007, were achieved purely on the strength of his sporting talent, not because of his undying devotion to Queen and country. So why does he now feel an entitlement to define patriotic allegiance for everyone else? The answer, quite simply, is hubris. Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience.",
      "‘His response to the atrocity in his home city might be his most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet. The problem is not just the hopelessly mangled logic, with Neville drawing a line from the act of an Islamist terrorist to enthusiasm for the Union Flag, but that he is biting the hand that feeds. Why is he belittling his own audience? Why does he not pause to consider that he has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch? The problem, hardly for the first time, is not angry middle-aged white men, but multimillionaires called Gary deluded into presuming that their football credentials give them a monopoly on moral virtue.’",
      "",
      "‘THERE was a time, presumably, when Gary Neville wasn’t quite so offended by the sight of our national flags as he now appears to be.",
      "‘When he was playing his 85 games for England I don’t remember him storming up into the stands to rip down St George’s Crosses or Union Jacks waved by enthusiastic fans, nor objecting to men, women and children who joined in the fun by painting red crosses on their faces.’",
      "Clark added: ‘In a video he posted online he boasted of how he had ordered a Union Flag put up by construction workers at a block of flats his company is building in ­Manchester to be taken down.",
      "‘To justify his actions, he claimed that the flag is being used by “angry middle-aged white men” in a “negative fashion”.",
      "‘Quite how you fly a Union Flag ­negatively I am not sure.’",
      "Clark continued: ‘So, no, we have no reason to be ashamed of our flag.",
      "‘On the contrary, we have every reason to fly it proudly from our homes and workplaces — if only the likes of Gary Neville will let us.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems it’s now open season on middle-aged white blokes, all year round. We are the opposite of a protected species. Scape-gammon, if you will. No one will call Neville out on his bigotry, or indeed hypocrisy, as he forgets who paid for the lifestyle he’s enjoyed since the Major years.",
      "‘Neville didn’t just raise a few questions – he also took a wild leap into scape-squirrel territory. He blamed flag-waving middle-aged white men for murders committed by a terrorist literally called Jihad.’",
      "",
      "‘It seems that in modern Britain you can be anything but the dreaded “middle-aged white man” (a description which, it should be noted, also applies to Neville).’",
      "READ NEXT: Neville claims Amorim ‘not off hook’ as Man Utd owners ‘won’t be kidded’ by ‘hopeless’ stars",
      "Roy Keane has named a manager who would “create havoc” as his preferred option replace under-fire Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments have inevitably brought division to a Mailbox that includes talk of ‘delusion’ among us ‘sissy left-wing’ types.",
      "We cannot yet, unfortunately, move on from the Gary Neville moral panic because the Daily Mail are still being entirely ridiculous about it.",
      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "There are some silly Liverpool messages and agreements but the big problem is the MailOnline’s atrocious reporting of that Gary Neville ‘outburst’."

      "A bad defeat against arch-rivals Liverpool will potentially be enough to spell an end to his sorry time at Old Trafford.",
      "There were flickers of positivity to take from the win over Sunderland as Senne Lammens had a positive debut, while Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo continue to find their feet, but Man Utd are still miles away from where they want to be, and there is little evidence of the club ending their prolonged era of misery.",

      "And while Amorim’s stubbornness is one of Man Utd’s biggest issues, the weak character of the squad is arguably even more concerning.",
      "Over at the F365 tables, some damning findings can be found on Man Utd’s start to this season.",
      "Firstly, Man Utd are bottom of our second half table, having only picked up four points after the break from their seven games.",
      "It is a different story with the first half table as United are in a far more respectable position of eighth, as all three of their wins this season were earned via their play in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "There is a similar theme with our conceding first table as Man Utd are 19th in those standings, while they are sixth in the table when scoring first.",
      "Also, Man Utd are joint-bottom of the Premier League on points gained from losing positions, with Amorim’s side yet to pick up a single point after going behind this season.",
      "And the main takeaway from these findings is that their glaring weakness is clear: this Man Utd squad has no backbone and their fragile players wilt at the earliest sign of adversity.",

      "It helps, of course it does, that This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. This is a club that sat astride an entire generation of English football at a specifically crucial period for English football.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson remains, in a twisted way, one of the key villains in the story of where Manchester United now find themselves. Looking back, everything he did just made things impossible for absolutely anyone else who came after him.",
      "He not only set impossibly high standards for an impossibly long and successful time, but in doing so allowed everything else at the club to become lazy and complacent, something most visibly obvious in Old Trafford itself and its continuing damp decay. With Fergie at the helm, United literally could not fail. That final title he won before retirement is an almost sarcastic display of achievement despite a club drifting blithely and obliviously towards disaster.",
      "Ferguson left a United playing staff that absolutely nobody else could succeed with, because he might just be the best football manager of all time and nobody else is that.",
      "Unlike, say, Jurgen Klopp and his succession planning at Liverpool, Ferguson did almost nothing to set the next manager up to succeed beyond declaring poor old David Moyes the Chosen One. Even Ferguson’s continued Old Trafford presence in his retirement years feels like it just makes an impossible job even more impossibly hard for whichever poor bastard is currently attempting it.",
      "And some very good and even great managers have tried and failed to lift this giant club from its post-Ferg funk.",
      "Which all rather leaves us pondering something more existential. The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can provide a plausible answer, is not “Are United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. Can you even imagine such a thing? They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, feasibly sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to the absurd levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the ’90s and ’00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they drift further and further from even basic big-club competence.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "Because, again, his record isn’t just ‘Bad for Manchester United’ bad; it’s ‘Bad for any Premier League club’ bad. It is relegation-form bad. The only other Premier League clubs with records anywhere near as bad as Amorim’s since he took over have all changed managers because of it, including one who did so out of sheer embarrassment at only beating United 1-0 in a European final.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but the continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected it.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have at least managed to win two games in a row is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of gentle Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments have inevitably brought division to a Mailbox that includes talk of ‘delusion’ among us ‘sissy left-wing’ types.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that except rank them.",
      "Crisis narratives have taken the Premier League by storm this season. But just how silly is it to suggest Liverpool might actually be facing one?",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe says it will take Ruben Amorim three years to prove himself, but getting through a perilous three weeks should earn the Man Utd boss more than a ...",
      "It is rare indeed to root for another club’s record signing, but we already feel invested in Newcastle’s £69million underdog Nick Woltemade…",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has opened up on the future of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and his relationship with the Glazer family."

      "These are the same people – Oliver Brown chief among them – who went after Gary Lineker for years, stamping their feet and having tantrums until they finally got what they wanted.",
      "The nature of these people is such that they always have to have some fresh meat to satisfy their bloodlust. They are truly warped and damaged individuals who either genuinely believe in the ill informed weapons-grade bollocks they spout, or worse, they spout it because they don’t want to upset the people who write their pay cheques.",
      "Like Lineker, Neville has a big platform. He has millions of people who listen to his views on a variety of topics. Some of those views terrify these people because the old media ecosystems of a select number of newspapers and 5 TV channels died a long time ago. Whereas back in the day they could just isolate anyone with a centre or centre left view, they can’t anymore. Social media scares them because they can’t control it.

      "Sadly, instead of trust in and development of youth, they’ve been used as a scapegoat while the core of the team is the oldest and worst, the players we cannot get rid of – players far worse than the “bomb squad”; the likes of Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Maguire.",
      "I don’t care who the manager is, whether they smile in press conferences or what system they play. I don’t even mind a few losses on the journey, but what I do care about is building a side for the future, and that work has to start now.",
      "Continuing to pick Bruno at CM is misguided at best, but a central partnership with Casemiro rather than letting Mainoo, Ugarte or Collyer develop into the role is the definition of short-term thinking and a suicide note and should be considered as much.",

      "So I keep hearing how other clubs need to click. Man City are transitioning. When Liverpool’s attack clicks, the league will feel it. So Arsenal’s attack will not click? or Chelsea’s attack? Basically, if you look at Man City 1st XI, basically the same team, bar Tejinders and Donnarumma. When you look at Liverpool’s 1st XI, same team, bar Wirtz, Isak, and Kerkez (I do not rate Frimpong, because whoever decided to buy a wing back who can’t cross or defend as a full back should be queried), and if you look at Arsenal’s 1st XI, basically the same team bar Zubimendi, Gyokeres, and Eze.",
      "One of the managers has never won a league title, but I hear stuff like when Liverpool attack clicks, Man City are transitioning, someone even wrote in today, and I quote, “more familiarity in selection. Arsenal got in 8 new players !!!!!!. We need to click too. We need our medical team to sort itself out so we get our players back. We are a work in Progress. Remember, we have never won the league",
      "As an aside, Wirtz was brought in to mitigate Trent’s deep-lying creativity;  most teams will get a deep-lying playmaker. its the logical thing to do as pure No. 10s are a dying breed, but Not Slot, he opted for a No. 10 who played his best and most productive football in his career in a team that had a deep-lying line-breaking playmaker (Xhaka), and did not get any DM with DLP characteristics, although Endo is not really fit for purpose. Secondly, Luiz Diaz left; he was marginally superior to Gakpo. Was he replaced? No. Slot decided Chiesa and Rio will step in, that way Gakpo isn’t challenged anymore, and I remember Elliot coming on for a tired Salah in Paris against PSG, that was also not replaced. I keep wondering why he did not get quality alternatives to his countrymen.",

The initial contact outside the box wasn’t enough… and you should also know, it was Michael Oliver on VAR, so it had to be Stonewall to qualify.",
      "No fuss regarding Paulinha at spurs celebrating a last minute equalizer with his shirty off vs wolves who had lost their first five. If that was an Arsenal player…",

      "Last week we had the absolute gems from Newcastle fans saying Gabriel should have been sent off for some handbags with Woltermade and completely ignoring LaScelles going full Nic Cage/John Travolta and trying to swap faces with Gyokeres.",

In his humble opinion, after being shown Ickle Mikel’s light bulb speech, he politely eviscerated it (after stifling a chuckle). He cited the example of the All Blacks’ manager being asked if the team talks he used to do were more for himself than the team. The team, when asked whether they were even paying attention, told him they weren’t taking the slightest bit of notice. So they stopped, because the manager had enough humility to do so, and because it wasn’t adding anything to the overall objective: Win (not the dog Mikel).",
      "The underlying theory being that if you need to cosplay David Brent in the moments before the players go out for kick off, then something is wrong in your match prep.

      "Of course pointing at Arsenal when you are dropping points is not the game and that mailbox contributor should wind it in. But I wouldn’t say that you can lose a 5 point lead in gameweek 7.

I am of course very much looking forward to playing a promoted team, an Ange Postecoglou team and West Ham at home.",
      "Whilst it is a Rafa fact that Liverpool are playing badly, when did a visit to Stamford Bridge become a 3 point banker? Even if Liverpool were playing very well, there is no reason to expect 3 points from there. Same for Glasner’s Palace away. Galatasaray was what it was. A one nil loss to a weak pen in Turkey in a phase of the Champions League where the prize for coming top of the league is playing PSG. Its just about getting to the next phase. The team with the most points in the group, now league phase, rarely win the tournament.",
      "But Liverpool are playing badly. There’s very little coaching time this time of the season. Its 2 games a week, international break, 2 games a week and now another international week. Although Slot won’t be with his players, hopefully he and his brain trust can work something out otherwise City are starting to look dangerous and we could be looking at third!

      "“Marcus Rashford is thoroughly enjoying his time at Barcelona, he made it clear more than 12 months before that he wanted to move to the Nou Camp,” Bailey told The Boot Room.",
      "“Now in Catalunya, there is no way he wants to return to Old Trafford. United still have him under contract to 2028, but Barca have the option on him and they intend to use it, although they want to talk terms.",
      "“United, in theory, know they could keep him but as it stands the club have little intention of doing so.”",
      "On fellow loanee Rasmus Hojlund, Bailey added: “Hojlund was a case that he had to go; they had signed Benjamin Sesko for huge money – he knew his time was up and the Ruben Amorim system wasn’t working for him.",
      "“Hojlund had such a huge expectation on his shoulders and that is a tough thing to deal with, and it just didn’t work out. But United always believed there was a player there, and they always appreciated his professionalism and the hard work.",
      "“Again, it was no surprise to them that a club like Napoli came in for him, and they are happy to see him performing – obviously, there is no way back as the deal for him is an obligation.”",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports.",
      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",

      "Man Utd’s much-needed 2-0 win against Sunderland in their final match before this month’s international break did little to ease pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim, who still appears to be on the brink at Old Trafford.",
      "In truth, it feels like it’ll only be a matter of time before he is dismissed, as he’s yet to win back-to-back Premier League games, has 19 losses in 50 matches overall and there is no sign of Man Utd making required progress following a busy summer transfer window.",
      "Amorim’s failing 3-4-3 system and his blunt refusal to adapt to get the best of his players/earn positive results will be the main reasons for his eventual downfall at Man Utd, who could be left to look for a new manager around a year after appointing the inexperienced 40-year-old.",

      "The Southgate links are largely sparked by his reported strong relationship with Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, but it is hardly surprising that most fans are not on board, as the 55-year-old does not exactly have a glittering managerial record at club level.",
      "Still, the biggest potential positive with appointing Southgate is his ability to galvanise a fractured group of players and inspire great results, with this among his best achievements as England boss.",
      "And Howe also possesses this quality, as he’s proven at Newcastle United that he has a unique ability to bring a whole club together, which he has done to an impressive extent in the PIF era at St James’ Park.",
      "The current version of Man Utd is nothing if not splintered and this is largely the doing of Ratcliffe and INEOS, who have alienated themselves by making brutal and sometimes needless cuts since taking control of the club.",
      "But a manager in the mould of Howe or Southgate would unite the Premier League giants, though the Newcastle boss is the superior candidate due to his impressive coaching pedigree at the top level of the club game.",
      "Howe certainly stands out among a bad bunch as the best English manager around at the moment, with his tactical adaptability, his insistence on great work ethic and his front-foot football lending itself perfectly to Man Utd.",
      "Would he leave Newcastle United for Man Utd? He’d be daft to at this stage, but Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha proved where the two clubs lie on the footballing food chain by opting for the Red Devils in the summer.

      "We were all wrong about Liverpool, Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko as these ten 2025/26 Premier League knee-jerk reactions have already been debunked…",
      "Ahead of this season, Liverpool were many people’s favourites to win the Premier League once again, with it becoming the overwhelming consensus that they would do so at a canter once they won their opening five games and Arsenal stuttered in their opening matches.",
      "However, the wheels have fallen off in recent weeks as Liverpool descended into a mini-crisis ahead of the international break, losing three away games in a row against Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "In truth, the warning signs were there before this sobering run of results, with Liverpool relying on last-minute goals and moments of magic to overshadow subpar team performances during their winning start.",
      "And in their last three games, Liverpool’s luck has run out as they have suffered three deserved defeats, while Arsenal have capitalised to move to the top of the table.",
      "It was initially felt that Liverpool’s statement £400m+ summer spend on signings would make them unstoppable in the Premier League this season. However, it now appears that head coach Arne Slot has made too many changes in a single window and his side’s severe lack of balance at least means they will not steamroll Arsenal and others en route to their 21st crown.",
      "READ: Top ten Premier League defectors features more players from Liverpool than Man Utd",
      "",
      "One such change has seen Slot tweak his midfield and introduce a natural No.10 following the once-British record signing of Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for £116m.",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Manchester City to Wirtz set Liverpool’s stall out for a remarkable summer window, with the special 22-year-old backed heavily as a pre-season favourite to win this season’s PFA Player of the Year award.",
      "But it says a lot about how Wirtz has performed for Liverpool to date that he has suddenly dropped from first to sixth in our ranking of the likeliest winners of this accolade in 2025/26.",
      "007 has become 009 as Wirtz, barring the odd flashes of quality, has been ineffective in all of Liverpool’s Premier League and Champions League matches this season, though he has also been impacted by Slot’s side failing to operate as a unit, with players in all positions suffering.",
      "Wirtz will eventually come to life for Liverpool because he’s too good not to, but he already has very little, if any, chance of picking up the PFA Player of the Year award at the end of his debut season at Anfield.",
      "",
      "This season is huge for Arsenal and head coach Mikel Arteta, who have no excuses remaining as they finally look to win big prizes following so many near misses in recent seasons.",
      "After spending around £250m on summer signings, Arteta arguably has the most complete squad in the Premier League with quality options in every position and were Arsenal to come up short, it has been suggested that their head coach’s overreliance on the handbrake would be their undoing.",
      "This argument was brought up as Arsenal left points on the table against Manchester City and Liverpool, though Arteta has implemented changes to put this right in recent weeks.",
      "Arteta went for the proverbial jugular against Newcastle United and his newfound attacking intent reaped rewards as Arsenal earned a 2-1 comeback away victory, which already feels massive. And there was confirmation of a turning point in their next game as he experimented with Eberechi Eze and Martin Odegaard in an exciting midfield three alongside Declan Rice against West Ham.",
      "So, for now at least, Arteta appears to have binned his handbrake as recent victories have given him the blueprint on how to overcome the low block and win while chasing a game, which could be pivotal in this season’s title race.",

      "Everyone associated with Liverpool and Arsenal would have let out an audible gulp when Man City hammered Wolves 4-0 away on the opening weekend via a brace from Erling Haaland and goals from summer signings Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki.",
      "However, those same individuals breathed a sigh of relief as Man City followed this big win up with back-to-back losses against Spurs and Brighton, suggesting that Pep Guardiola’s winning machine may not be fully fixed after all.",
      "Man City are certainly in a better position than last season as Phil Foden’s return to form and Gianluigi Donnarumma’s great start have been huge positives, while Haaland has taken his goalscoring and overall game to extraordinary new heights.",
      "Still, this Man City squad is a far cry from the champions of years gone by, with their fragility proven by their opponents’ lack of fear when facing Guardiola’s side who, even with Donnarumma in goal, look shaky at the back and are struggling to put teams away. They will be fine for the top four again, but it’s too soon in their rebuild phase to seriously challenge Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s Club World Cup final win over Paris-Saint Germain felt like a coming-out party for Enzo Maresca’s side after they showed great resilience to finish in the top four and win the Europa Conference League to take pressure off of the head coach.",
      "And some argued that their Club World Cup triumph would propel them to being credible Premier League title challengers this season and winners in the next couple of years, but their start to this campaign has indicated that they are in a similar position to 2024/25 and how swiftly an outlook for a manager can change.",
      "The Maresca sack hype picked up last month as Chelsea lost three games in five and their only win was against League One side Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The pressure on Maresca has eased following much-needed wins over Benfica and Liverpool, though Chelsea are lacking a top-quality goalkeeper and centre-back required to take them to the next level.",
      "",
      "“I can only congratulate them in Stuttgart for finding, so to speak, an idiot who would pay that much money, because we certainly wouldn’t have done that.”",
      "Former Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge exemplified the clear bitterness of the Bundesliga champions with this childish dig at Newcastle United over paying £69m to sign Woltemade.",
      "Yes, Newcastle’s desperation to land a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak was exploited by Stuttgart as the Premier League side overpaid to sign Woltemade, who headed to England relatively unproven after only one good season in the German top flight.",
      "But Woltemade sparkled at the summer’s U21 European Championships and has expertly handled the immense pressure of succeeding Isak, with the confidence boost of a debut goal certainly helping his cause.",
      "The 23-year-old has a credible case to be one of the signings of the summer after scoring four goals in his opening seven games, especially considering the pressure he’s under amid the absence of fellow arrival Yoane Wissa. Rummenigge is actually the “idiot”…",
      "",
      "There was a ridiculous early-season clamour for Emery to be sacked by Aston Villa amid their alarming start to this campaign.",
      "In hindsight, everyone should have seen this coming following their failure to secure Champions League qualification, limited transfer activity and speculation surrounding the futures of several key players.",
      "The Premier League’s PSR rules have stuffed Aston Villa more than most, with these factors contributing to Villa finding themselves in the Premier League relegation zone at the start of this season.",
      "The loss of form of Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins has made Aston Villa goal-shy, but Emery has found some answers as they have dug deep to climb out of the mire with four consecutive wins in all competitions.",
      "Villa still have their issues with a squad of lesser quality than last season and they will likely struggle to replicate their 2024/25 sixth-place finish, but Emery remains the most important person at Villa and it was daft for anyone to think that they would be better off without him.",
      "",
      "By signing up-and-coming forward Sesko instead of a proven upgrade, e.g. Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen, to solve their striker problem, Man Utd ran the risk of landing another Hojlund.",
      "In his first season at Old Trafford, Hojlund proved his worth by netting a respectable tally of 16 goals in all competitions, but his second year was a completely different story as he lost all of his confidence and was a shell of his best self.",
      "So it was understandable that United felt he needed to be offloaded and replaced in the summer, with INEOS eventually settling on Sesko, a similar profile of striker, to succeed the Napoli newbie at Old Trafford.",
      "As expected, Sesko immediately came under scrutiny at Man Utd and was quickly written off amid his slow start, but he’s gradually found his feet by scoring in his last two Premier League games. Hojlund, meanwhile, has been a revelation at Napoli, netting four goals in six games, to make a permanent transfer “almost guaranteed”.",
      "The respective performances of these strikers in recent weeks suggest that they have the tools to succeed at Man Utd, though that is heavily dependent on the service provided to them; Sesko is currently dealing with this better than Hojlund did.",
      "",
      "It was hard not to worry about Brentford as they lost Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Wissa in a single window, while outsiders feared for the worst once they appointed novice boss Andrews to replace their beloved predecessor.",
      "And while these worries were backed up by their 3-1 opening weekend loss to Nottingham Forest, Brentford and Andrews have recovered in their subsequent matches.",
      "Helped by the goalscoring of fit-again Igor Thiago and inspired summer signing Jordan Henderson, Brentford have moved out of the bottom three via Andrews schooling Ruben Amorim and beating Aston Villa.",
      "Brentford still are expected to be in the bottom six this season as they have a weaker squad than recent years, but Andrews is quickly proving himself to be capable of the head coach’s role and it would not be a shock at all if he guides them to survival.",
      "",
      "The fight at the bottom is certainly more interesting than it’s been in recent seasons and this is largely thanks to the promoted sides recruiting well and making necessary tactical tweaks to make them more competitive at this level.",
      "Sunderland have been a breath of fresh air under Regis Le Bris and certainly look the most likely of the promoted teams to survive, while Leeds United, despite their lack of bite in attack, have shored up defensively to give themselves a strong platform to secure positive results.",
      "Burnley also acquitted themselves well in their opening couple of matches, but it has been more of the same since the end of August, with Scott Parker’s side only picking up a single point since their sole Premier League win of the campaign against Sunderland.",
      "This already leaves the Clarets in the bottom three and it’s difficult to see a significant improvement en route to another relegation without a scrap due to their newfound defensive frailties and their attack being even worse than it seems as they overperform their xG.",
      "Ian Wright believes Arsenal have “got a great chance” of winning the Premier League title this season but has doubts over Mikel Arteta after a couple of errors.",
      "Former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has allayed fears for Florian Wirtz, stating he himself had to “adjust a bit” and the midfielder will “delight us all” ...",

      "Manchester United have been ‘not good’ and ’embarrassing at times’ but the Ruben Amorim sack calls continue because of one game – and his ‘ridiculous’ subs.",
      "We have bits on Arsenal and Crystal Palace too.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Before the season started I wrote in saying how I’d be very happy if United reached the second international break with 12 points. Well so far we’ve had two terrible performances against City and Brentford, two good performances against Arsenal and Sunderland, two half and half performances against Fulham and Burnley, then one sort of good but also sort of not performance against Chelsea. A properly mixed bag resulting in 10 points.",
      "I’m not happy with that but given the fine margins involved I am content for the moment. If Bruno scores that penalty against Fulham or Collins is sent off in the Brentford game (as Webb has now admitted should have happened) then perhaps we’d be where I wanted. No amount of whataboutery could put a positive spin on this season so far though I think it’s reasonable to say United are within the margins of error for my preseason expectations.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, we’re not good and have been embarrassing at times, but outside of the Grimsby result I don’t think there is enough to seriously consider a managerial change at the moment. I think much of the despair from fans and the pressure on Amorim is linked with that cup exit which will linger and even grow until a decent run of form is achieved.",
      "Speaking of which, the next yardstick I suggested preseason was around 30 points by Christmas. Beyond the next game away at Liverpool where I expect no points (regardless of their tiny blip in form they are massive favourites for the win) there will be 9 league games to achieve this. So at minimum its 5 wins and a few draws to stay within the margin of error of +/- one result. There are some particularly tough games in that run (Spurs, Palace, and Bournemouth) but the whole league is tough so if Amorim can’t get it done now he likely never will.",
      "He made a few subtle changes to his system against Sunderland with an almost 4-4-2 formation out of possession which may help going forward. However, the centre back subs are getting a bit ridiculous now. I wouldn’t mind if there was any perceivable advantage. De Ligt has been great in the central role but is a lost and panicking mess whenever he’s asked to be a wide centre back. Why then keep moving him out there just so you can bring on Harry Maguire instantly making the defence significantly slower and more vulnerable? More than systems or formations or whatever its those kind of decisions that will cost us late goal and perhaps ultimately Amorim’s job.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "So Arsenal, the team that has had its captain missing through injury for basically the entire season, alongside several other important players (Havertz, Hincapie, Madueke, Jesus, and now Rice), while playing arguably the most difficult schedule to start the season has “all the cards stacked in their favor”?",
      "The defending champions and the serial champions prior to them haven’t “clicked” but the team at the top of the table despite their injuries and tough schedule should’ve seen off the competition by week 6 of 38… because of net spend (we never talk wages though)? Ha!",

I shouldn’t respond but I do referring to Liverpool being runners up fifteen times to Arsenal’s eleven but ho hum. The biggest bottlers were Liverpool in1989 at ‘Fortress’ Anfield!

      "Similar to shin splints and unexploded World War II bombs, bogey teams were a real phenomenon in the 1990s but at some point in the intervening years, they fell away from the forefront of our collective thoughts. However, Everton appear to have brought the idea back: according to the Athletic, they have only won three times after conceding the first goal in the past few years, and all three of those have been against Crystal Palace. Happy to help, I guess.",
      "Despite the efforts of F365 and other parts of the football media, most people connected to Palace believe becoming a top four club is a bit of a pipe dream, but meaningfully reducing the gap between Palace and the top four is an admirable, achievable goal. This was brought into sharp focus, because if Palace were a top four club, David Moyes wouldn’t have been able to beat them.",
      "A curious game at the This Means Bramley-Moore Stadium, in that neutrals probably enjoyed it more than fans of either team, who will have mixed feelings about how their respective sides played. Crystal Palace completely dominated Everton for significant periods of the game, but only went in 1-0 up at half time against an Everton team booed off by their fans, then tired significantly in the second half, lost their composure, and ended up losing. The Toffees meanwhile, came out for the second half with a different setup (helped by some very effective substitutes), played their way into the game and came away with all three points.",
      "Like all winning teams, Everton’s winner had an element of fortune about it, but there’s no doubt Jack Grealish was in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing, when the ball rebounded off him into the goal. Bit of a rubbish way for the unbeaten run to come to an end but that’s just how it goes sometimes. I don’t think the defeat suggests anything too drastic needs to change for Palace, you can’t plan for players missing gilt-edged chances provided they keep creating chances, and you can’t plan to completely prevent players getting tired, only to mitigate the effects of their fatigue on the rest of the team. It says a lot about how far Palace have come that losing one game is newsworthy.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "The MailOnline really does need to be careful about calling this a ”racist’ outburst, by the way. That ground seems wafer thin.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments lamenting “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” does appear to have infuriated a great deal of angry, middle-aged white men who do indeed know exactly what they’re doing.",
      "It is definitely easy to see how Neville calling for togetherness and unity, denouncing “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and wanting “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony” has incensed and enraged so many people. He must have expected such incendiary, unpleasant words to evoke such a reaction.",
      "And after the single-person BOYCOTT, non-existent sack threat and really quite inflammatory quote marks around ”racist’ outburst’ when no-one described it as such because it wasn’t even close to being applicable, Tuesday brings a full-scale attempt to bring down the nefarious Neville.",
      "The charge is depressingly predictably led by angry, middle-aged white man Oliver Brown of the Daily Telegraph, who lays into ‘a degree of solipsism remarkable even by his own standards’ from Neville – a reminder that his great crime here is wanting people to come together and not hate and kill each other – before landing on that money-making quote:",
      "‘”We need to check ourselves, start to bring ourselves back to a neutral point,” he says, playing the great healer,’ Brown writes.",
      "‘After all, nothing says neutrality quite like blaming the toxicity exclusively on “angry middle-aged white men”.’",
      "And nothing says grift quite like knowing someone said “the division that’s being created…mainly by angry, middle-aged white men who know exactly what they’re doing,” but actually hearing them say those angry middle-aged white men are ‘exclusively’ the problem.",
      "The people Neville ‘disdains’ are those who spread and incite prejudice and hatred based solely on nationality and the colour of someone’s skin. It is only ‘strange’ that we are supposed to pretend he is being unreasonable in that stance.",
      "It is also bizarre that a supposedly reputable journalist can write freely that Neville’s video ‘has provoked less applause than derision and contempt, with increasing threats from viewers to stop paying for Sky in protest,’ without any actual evidence of such. Are those ‘increasing threats’ in the room with us now, Oliver?",
      "‘Neville acts as if his position as the country’s most prominent football analyst also confers the right to be its conscience,’ Brown adds. Think he’s just acting as if he has an opinion and a platform, to be honest. So do you, and yet this is how you choose to use it.",
      "But of course, the ‘deluded’ Neville, much like Gary Lineker, ‘has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch’.",
      "If you want to just write ‘Keep Politics Out Of Football’ you can. No-one is stopping you, pal.",
      "This, by the way, is perhaps Neville’s ‘most dangerous lapse into self-parody yet’.",
      "Ah yes, that ‘dangerous’ rhetoric about wanting people to like each other and not be weaponised or led by hate speech. It’s some ‘self-parody’ from… Neville. When Mediawatch has an update on whether Brown has discovered the concept of irony we will let you know.",

      "And this article, most certainly framed as a criticism and hoping to paint Neville in a negative light, includes such paragraphs as:",
      "‘Neville has often shared his opinions on political issues, such as saying people should ‘detest’ the working conditions for migrant workers in Qatar and condemning Boris Johnson for ‘fuelling’ racism during his time as Prime Minister.’",

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Ruben Amorim",
      "Wednesday 8 October 2025 20:34, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner at United, has said he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "The Sunderland performance demonstrated flexibility from Amorim, something he has been accused of lacking. The team defended in a 4-4-2 and attacked in a 3-4-3.",
      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",
      "United's ultimate aim for this season is a return to European football. Whether that is the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League - we will have to wait and see where this team can end up, but the reality is this team is still being rebuilt.",
      "The next run of fixtures will give all watching a better indication of what will be possible this season - with away trips to Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and just the one home fixture to Brighton before the next break - no matter how the results go, we will learn a lot.",
      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",
      "United have gone through change at their academy leadership level - with new academy director Stephen Torpey succeeding Nick Cox, who has joined Everton as technical director.",
      "With Torpey's recent arrival, United, led by director of football Wilcox, are keen to accelerate plans to rebuild the academy in the hope the facilities will match some of the best in the world.",
      "United decided not to develop the academy facilities at the same time as the men's first team as it would have been too disruptive on site, but having invested in both the men's and women's facilities in recent years, their next focus is the academy.",
      "United have some exciting emerging talents such as 15-year-old JJ Gabriel, who has been starring for Darren Fletcher's U18 side.",
      "Closer to the first team, U21 attacking midfielder Shea Lacey was seen training with the England first team during this international break.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is under pressure after a mixed start to the season followed last term's 15th-placed finish; Man Utd's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given him a huge vote of support: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",

      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.",
      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.",
      "\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.",
      "\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",
