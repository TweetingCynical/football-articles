      "Safe to say, it has far from been the ideal scenario for Ruben Amorim since taking over from Erik ten Haag as the coach finds his United side two places above the relegation zone and yet to hit the magical 40-point mark making it their worst league campaign since 1977/78 season.",
      "They do, however, have the chance to still join the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal in Europe's top club competition with a win in Bilbao against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final. Despite having the joint-worst win record in the league (other than those relegated) in the Premier League - tied with Everton and West Ham - the Red Devils can still return to the Champions League stage and Paddy Power is offering 70/1 odds on that to happen!",

      "Canada striker Jonathan David will be a wanted man this summer as he prepares to leave Lille on a free transfer. Manchester United are among the clubs in the mix for the Ligue 1 hotshot, but his international boss Jesse Marsch doesn't expect him to go anywhere without a guarantee of first team football.",
      "David will be one of the leading men for Canada as they look to get out of the group stage at a men's World Cup for the first time. They picked up just one point in Qatar in 2022, but enter the 2026 edition as co-hosts along with the United States and Mexico.",
      "25-year-old striker David is already his country's all-time top scorer, but enters this summer with a big decision to make. And it's one with former Leeds boss Marsch - who led Canada to third place in the CONCACAF Nations League in March - has shed some light on what the frontman will think about ahead of his upcoming move.",
      "“Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,” Marsch told reporters as Canada named a preliminary squad ahead of this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. “He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe.",
      "\"But he’s going to want to play as well. And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.”",
      "United are among a number of sides keen on David, who scored 109 goals across 232 games for Lille. Napoli are also reported to have held talks with a view to a swoop, while Inter Milan have also been linked.",
      "If the forward joins Inter, Marsch wouldn't expect him to feature in the Gold Cup. That tournament overlaps with the Club World Cup, where Inter have been drawn in a group with River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds and Monterrey.",
      "Lille finished fifth in Ligue 1 this season, securing Europa League football next term. However, ahead of the final game of the season, David confirmed it would be his last.",
      "\"I wanted you to hear from me that after five years at the club, it's time to say goodbye,\" he said on Instagram. \"I've spent five amazing years in Lille.I know it hasn't been the easiest, but I hope that my goals and celebrations have brought you joy and happiness. It's been a long and fun ride, and especially with those two titles that we won together, I think [that] makes the story even better.\"",
      "He also shared a message to his team-mates, coaches and club staff, before addressing the fans once more and saying: \"I know the beginning wasn't the easiest, we had some hard moments, but I think that with your support and your help it has helped me flourish throughout all these years and make me the player I am today.\""

      "Donny van de Beek has claimed his injury struggles date back to his time warming the bench at Manchester United. The Dutchman was signed in 2020 but was unable to ever make himself a regular.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spent £35million to land the versatile attacker, but only made us of him sporadically as Van de Beek's frustration mounted. He scored on his debut but was rarely preferred to Bruno Fernandes with his minutes very much at a premium.",
      "He's since left, joining Girona in Spain, but has continued to battle an Achilles issue. The Dutchman has enjoyed far more minutes than he did at Old Trafford but clearly still has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to his underwhelming stint in Manchester.",
      "Solskjaer continued to defend his lack of use of the player, but in the years since Van de Beek's health has been a battle. He confessed that the time he spent as a sub means his body was less accustomed to the intensity of playing regularly.",
      "He told SportBible: \"It’s difficult to build rhythm and confidence when you’re constantly being sidelined. It’s hard to be at your best when you're in and out of the team, and I think when you're not playing regularly. Your body isn’t used to the intensity and you become more prone to injuries. The lack of consistent minutes didn’t help either.\"",
      "Van de Beek's goal on his debut did little to aid his cause and even when he would impress he was quickly returned to his bench role. He also admits the random cameos did nothing for his case with bit part minutes not helping him become a regular.",
      "He said: \"I think I deserved more chances, especially in my first year. I didn’t play all the time, but when I did, I had some good games. I was convinced I would get more opportunities. I felt good, and thought, ‘Okay, my time will come’ but for some reason, it didn’t happen. After a year or two, it gets harder because if you don’t get a longer run of games then it’s difficult to prove yourself.\"",
      "Van de Beek would score the last goal of the Solskjaer era as he came off the bench to score what would be a consolation during a 4-1 loss at Watford. The Norwegian was forced to defend his use of the player on several occasions and claimed leaving him on the bench spoke to the quality of the squad.",
      "\"I think it says a lot about our depth of quality in the squad that we don't have to use him every single game,\" he said.",
      "Despite that claim Van de Beek would make just four starts in his only full season under Solskjaer and things didn't change when Erik ten Hag, who coached him at Ajax, came on board before he eventually left Manchester."

      "Last summer, Jay Slater's disappearance in Ibiza grabbed headlines across the UK, with many theorising what could have happened to the British teen until his death was tragically announced. This Wednesday, Jay Slater's name returned to headlines as our news team live blogged his inquest - taking place to establish the events that led to Jay's death,",
      "Jay Slater's mum broke down in tears at the inquest into her son's death.

Labour has argued the unpopular decision - announced just weeks after the party's election victory last year - was necessary to fix the Tory mess they inherited.",
      "But in recent weeks Labour MPs have blamed the policy for the party's bruising results at the local elections earlier this month and defeat to Reform UK at a key by-election. Speaking at PMQs, Mr Starmer said: \"We all know the economy was left in absolute mess by the Tories. We had to stabilise the economy with tough decisions but the right decisions.

He’s not going to get that with Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk and the other players who they have there.",

      "Liverpool boss Slot has pointed to the need for added weapons after his rotation failed to pay off in some high-profile defeats. The comments come after the Dutchman criticised Nunez for his approach during a draw with Aston Villa back in February in which he missed a golden chance.",
      "\"I would prefer him to score but the word 'chance' says it all,\" Slot said at the time. \"It's a chance so it's not 100 per cent sure that the ball goes in, and players miss chances,\"",
      "\"What was a bit harder for me to accept was his behaviour after that chance. I think it got too much in his head, where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his a** off and makes sure he helps the team.\""

      "He has gone on to become one of the club's key players, if not their most important. However, it's evident that Fernandes still holds a major soft spot for Leões, as evidenced by a call with João Reis that left him crying tears of joy.",
      "Sporting were crowned Liga Portugal winners on Saturday after beating Vitória Guimarães 2-0 on home soil, finishing two points clear of rivals Benfica. And it appears as though the club which put Fernandes on the world stage hasn't forgot about him, with Reis - who is described by his professional LinkedIn account as the club's U16 strength and conditioning coach - quick to call the 30-year-old in jubilation.",
      "Speaking about the call, Fernandes told Sport TV: \"Much happiness and gratitude for everything I lived in Sporting.",
      "\"It is a club for which I have enormous affection, a huge passion. I was as happy or happier than all those who were celebrating. Unfortunately, I could not be there, but I will still celebrate many titles in Marquês.",
      "\"I would have liked to have been there to congratulate the players, coaches and staff. I was able to do it with those who are here [Ruben Amorim and company] and who were part of this, congratulate them.",

      "\"I'm happy about that. I got a call from João Reis which brought tears to my eyes. It's a club that I'll always have enormous affection for and that will always have a place in my heart.\"",
      "After spending his early professional years with Novara, Udinese, and Sampdoria, Fernandes signed for Sporting CP in 2017. With 63 goals and 50 assists across 137 games, Fernandes lifted a Taca de Portugal with the side, as well as two Taca da Ligas - with the Primeira Liga that the club achieved this year coming as one of the very few titles that evaded him during his own three-year stint.",
      "Another United figure who will undoubtedly be celebrating Sporting's recent success is manager Ruben Amorim, who left the Portuguese outfit in November to join the Red Devils. While Amorim and Fernandes never crossed paths together in their homeland's capital, the two have forged a formidable partnership at Old Trafford, despite a lacklustre string of results for United in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils currently sit 16th in the league with just one game remaining to play, with Amorim having managed just seven victories since succeeding Erik ten Hag. However, the side's fortunes could change on Wednesday night when they face a Spurs side - who are also struggling domestically - in the final of the Europa League.",

The Red Devils secured a 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Club in the semi-finals to stamp their spot at San Mamés in Bilbao.",
      "Spurs, meanwhile, achieved 3-2 and 2-1 aggregate wins over AZ Alkmaar and Frankfurt respectively in the earlier knockout stages, before relishing in a 5-1 win over Bodo/Glimt in the semis to make it to the final. Both sides will be eager to make up for disastrous Premier League seasons - with Spurs sitting just one point behind United in the Premier League in 17th place - in what promises to be an action packed evening of football.",

      "Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou have been told that even victory in the Europa League final might not be enough to save their jobs. The two under-pressure managers lead Manchester United and Tottenham in the high stakes match in Bilbao on Wednesday evening knowing the game will define their seasons.",
      "Both teams have endured a miserable season in the Premier League, with United 16th and Spurs 17th, making victory in the Basque Country vital. As well as giving their fans something to cheer, a win would automatically guarantee a place in the 2025/26 Champions League – a significant factor financially and in terms of attracting new players this summer.",
      "Spurs have not lifted a trophy since the League Cup in 2008, while Amorim knows victory would significantly alter the perception of his debut campaign, having failed to make an impact since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "It is an intriguing backdrop to the match at the San Mames Stadium, but former Tottenham midfielder Steffen Freund thinks the result may be a moot point. The German believes that, realistically, the decisions of those in power won’t be swayed by 90 minutes.",
      "“So I think maybe both coaches will go after the game. I don’t like that, but think about Man United: most of the coaches have been sacked – [Louis] van Gaal after an FA Cup win, [Erik] ten Hag after an FA Cup win – so that’s how it is in the football business. And as a coach, I would love to see both coaches keep going.”",
      "There have been widespread reports that Postecoglou could be sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, regardless of whether he comes good on his promise to win silverware in his second season. The Australian was combative in his pre-match press conference, pushing back against a journalist who suggested that he would be perceived as a “clown” if he loses.",
      "He has tried to play down the importance of the occasion, but Spurs veteran Son Heung-min knows what victory would mean. “It’s going to be a huge, huge moment for both of us and also for the boys if we win it,” the Spurs skipper said.",
      "“As we always say, the first step is going to be really hard, but if you win that trophy, we can change the mentality, we can change the history and hopefully we can continue to compete for another trophy.”"

      "Manchester United have identified four players who are off the table for any potential sales in the upcoming summer transfer window as Ruben Amorim plans to overhaul his squad. United have endured a disappointing season under new boss Amorim, who took over following Erik ten Hag's dismissal in October.",
      "Currently, the Red Devils languish 16th in the Premier League with a mere 10 victories in the entire 2024/25 campaign - three of which were secured under Ten Hag. With the Europa League final against Tottenham being the club's last chance for silverware this season, significant changes may be required over the summer if Amorim hopes to restore United's former glory.",
      "The reality is that the 40-year-old strategist has found it challenging to adapt the squad he inherited from Ten Hag's reign to his distinctive style of play, with pundits like Gary Neville suggesting that at least six new faces are needed in the first team ahead of next season. However, the board may need to sell stars before they can bring in new talent, as demonstrated by their modest business in January, which saw them spend just £26million on Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "It's believed that minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe is looking to boost United's transfer budget this summer with the permanent departures of three stars currently out on loan. Marcus Rashford has been showcasing his skills at Aston Villa since January after it became clear he didn't fit into Amorim's plans, while Antony is currently enjoying a stint with Real Betis, and Jadon Sancho is at Chelsea.",
      "There's a notion that United could pocket as much as £100m for the trio; however, offloading the players may prove a bit tricky. Chelsea might opt to pay a £5m penalty instead of purchasing Sancho for the £25m they agreed as an obligation for finishing within the top 14 of the league this season, given his lacklustre performances in west London.",
      "Meanwhile, Villa are yet to agree to the £40m asking price that United have set for Rashford, and although Antony has become one of Betis' standout performers recently, they're under no obligation to buy him at the end of his loan spell. Four players who are considered indispensable for United might also cause Amorim some headaches when it comes to his summer plans.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Leny Yoro, and Harry Maguire are seen as essential assets at United for the 2025/26 season, meaning that Amorim might be forced to incorporate them into his future plans and build around them – despite Fernandes turning 30 in September, and Maguire just celebrating his 32nd birthday in March. This represents a significant reversal in terms of the players considered indispensable at United going into last year's summer transfer window.",
      "According to the same source in April 2024, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund were the three players that United needed to retain. However, lacklustre performances throughout 2024/25 have seemingly shifted opinion at Old Trafford.",
      "While Garnacho has contributed six goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, he has recently found himself relegated to the bench in favour of Mason Mount.",
      "Hojlund, on the other hand, has only managed to score four times this term in the Premier League, a far cry from the prolific striker that United currently crave. Meanwhile, Mainoo has also failed to deliver from midfield – both stars are goalless and without an assist in 24 league games this season. Only time will tell how things unfold for United this summer, with pressure expected to increase on Amorim in 2025/26.",
      "The board has been remarkably patient with the mastermind's lack of results this term, but that could soon change if he fails to deliver after having a full transfer window and pre-season to adjust his team. However, the forthcoming transfer window will not be the primary concern for United's top brass on Wednesday night.",
      "The Red Devils are setting their sights on clinching their first Europa League title in eight years as they square off against Ange Postecoglou's Spurs. The two teams have only ever clashed once before in Europe, with Matt Busby's United triumphing over Spurs 4-3 on aggregate across two legs during the last 16 of the 1963/64 Cup Winners' Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games in the 2025/26 season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "He has netted 33 goals for Saudi side Al-Nassr this season - that form coming after 64 goals across his first 18 months in the Middle East. Naturally, Ronaldo would usually be putting a little bit of thought into hanging his boots up having reached the twilight of his career.",
      "But it appears that new data might have convinced the Portuguese forward to carry on even longer. Ronaldo has had a long-running partnership with fitness watch manufacturers WHOOP.",
      "And part of the technology has revealed that his ‘biological age’ is over a decade younger than he actually is. Speaking on the WHOOP podcast, he said: \"I can't believe it's so good. 28.9.\"",
      "And after learning that, Ronaldo joked that he could potentially prolong his career well into the 2030s. He added: \"This means I'll play football for another 10 years.\"",
      "Ronaldo has already spoken about potentially stepping away from the pitch. While he confirmed that there wasn’t a specific plan, he did admit that it was something on the horizon.",
      "He said: \"I just want to enjoy. Plan for retirement... if it has to happen, in one or two years... I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon... I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going.",

      "He said: \"We all know as footballers, and I know this really, really well from my playing time, there's a time when you come and there's a time where you need to go. I think his time had come a while ago, and he needs to give somebody else the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't think that he is at the moment better than the other options that Portugal have. Some games you need to press, some games you need to do different things, and I don't think that he can do that anymore. There’s no shame in that. For him to even be playing at 40 is a landmark in itself.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to hang the boots up. I think that time will come when Messi stops. I think when Messi decides to call it a day, so will Ronaldo.\""

The San Mames Stadium, home of Athletic Bilbao and the venue for much-anticipated showpiece, has banned e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products, with strict penalties for those who flout the rules.",
      "United and Spurs are both hoping to turn dismal seasons into memorable ones by not only landing a major piece of silverware, but also booking an unlikely ticket to next season's Champions League. Up to 80,000 supporters are expected to descend on Bilbao, a city with a population of around 350,000.",
      "Those with match tickets will need to be on guard, as spectators caught vaping could face ejection from the stadium, a fine, and even a report to the police. While vaping is legal in Spain, the rules inside San Mamés are far stricter for the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of the game, Dan Marchant, director of Vape Club and a founding member of the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), urged fans to respect the rules. \"If vaping is banned in the venue you're travelling to, it's best not to risk a fine or worse,\" he said.",
      "\"Fans heading to Bilbao for the Europa League final need to be especially careful. Those attempting to enter with prohibited items could face eviction and be reported to the police.\"",
      "Marchant added: \"Vaping within the stadium is prohibited, though there may be a designated smoking area. Check ahead of time, and don't risk using your vape in non-designated areas.\"",
      "The list of banned items at San Mamés is extensive. Alongside vaping products and e-liquids, fans are prohibited from bringing photo and video cameras without permission, helmets, balaclavas, ski masks, drones, oversized flags or banners (larger than 2m), food, drugs, alcohol, weapons, laser pointers, megaphones, fireworks, flares, smoke powder, glass or plastic bottles, backpacks and large bags.",

Both clubs have suffered dismal domestic campaigns, sitting 16th and 17th respectively in the Premier League - perilously close to relegation. Ravaged by injuries and plagued by inconsistency, the game represents not just a shot at redemption, but a springboard back into Champions League football.",

Gyokeres is being chased by several top European clubs after putting together a staggering campaign for Sporting, but nothing has been settled yet.",
      "The 26-year-old centre-forward has racked up 53 goals and 13 assists in 51 games across all competitions and could end the campaign with two trophies. Sporting wrapped up the league and now face rivals Benfica in the Portuguese Cup final on Sunday.",
      "Once that game is out of the way, it’s expected to be open season for transfer talks, with Sporting happy to sell for £60million. While Manchester United are considered contenders, Portuguese newspaper O Jogo have claimed Gyokeres is 'on his way to Arsenal'.",
      "It is clear that Gyokeres’ team-mates don’t know if that is true, given the insight of midfielder Pedro Goncalves. “I asked him and we all asked him. He says he’s not a fortune teller. We still have the Portuguese Cup against Benfica to play,” he told Canal 11.",
      "“I have a very good relationship with him, but I don’t talk about it with him. What I know is because of Fabrizio Romano… I’m sticking with him. I don’t know if he’s going to leave.”",
      "They have also kept an eye on RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, but Gyokeres’ weight of goals has made him an attractive prospect. Speaking earlier this year, the Swede admitted he hopes to play for \"one of the best teams in Europe\" soon and Arsenal’s run to the Champions League semi-finals will help.",
      "Goncalves knows that his team-mate is ready for a big-money transfer. “I feel like he’s evolved a lot since he arrived,” he added. “There are training sessions where it seems like he’s holding back.”",
      "United are also interested in Gyokeres, who flourished under Ruben Amorim’s management in Lisbon, but also have other targets. They are in talks to sign Wolves forward Matheus Cunha for £62.5m, while Ipswich’s Liam Delap is also a target for £30m.",
      "Sporting are eager to do business and have agreed to sell Gyokeres for below his release clause as a thank you for his outstanding service. He will reportedly be available for £60m – substantially less than his reported £83.6m release clause."

United’s Europa League form has eased the pressure a little, and Amorim can look forward to a first full pre-season as United boss, even if his side are beaten by a Spurs team equally desperate for a trophy, reports The Times.",

That is in contrast to his rapport with Ten Hag, who was said to be too robotic for Ratcliffe’s liking.",
      "Amorim and Ratcliffe have developed a strong bond. They speak every week over the phone and share messages in a WhatsApp group containing other senior club figures. It has also emerged that Amorim isn’t afraid to put his boss in his place by telling him to f*** off, albeit light-heartedly.",
      "Ratcliffe said in March: \"I really, really like Ruben. He's a very thoughtful guy. Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben. I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it's going wrong, and he tells me to f*** off! I like him.\"",

      "“It's a good thing because publicly, it's a different thing. It shows a lot of confidence from the owner. I felt it since day one. Since day one, I felt that the people really like my work.",
      "\"My work is the result, so also sometimes it's harder for me - my relationship with them - than theirs with me. We're really honest with each other. I'm a little bit the same.",
      "“I came from a normal family and now I'm here in Manchester and I'm still the same person. I feel that he is the same [type of] person, so we can talk like that.”"

      "Ruben Amorim singled out Casemiro's stellar performance in the Europa League for Manchester United in a WhatsApp message to Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The midfielder, 33, has been instrumental in United's journey to the final this season.",
      "Despite the Red Devils enduring their worst league campaign this century, they have the chance to win European silverware and secure a spot in next season's Champions League when they face Tottenham on Wednesday evening.",
      "After missing the initial group stage match against Twente FC in September, Casemiro has played all but 21 minutes of United's Europa League knockout stage fixtures.",
      "His three assists were key in defeating Lyon in the second leg of the quarter-final, and he netted a goal in both legs of the semi-final against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "In the first leg of the Bilbao tie, the Brazilian, who joined United in a £60million deal in August 2022, covered more ground than any other player (10.5km). That fact was relayed by Amorim to the club's minority owner, Ratcliffe, after the game.",
      "As reported by The Times, Amorim and Ratcliffe have weekly phone conversations and occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that includes other senior club figures.",
      "It's understood that the Portuguese head coach shares his post-match thoughts in a mini-report, with additional data also fed into the group chat.",
      "Amorim's views on Casemiro highlight the player's significant improvement this season, despite initially being used sparingly by the manager.",
      "The five-time Champions League winner faced widespread criticism last season from supporters and pundits for appearing past his prime and seemingly lacking the stamina to play in central midfield in the Premier League. However, those concerns have eased in recent months.",
      "Casemiro's upturn in form also reflects Amorim's man-management skills, which have been recognised and appreciated by those above him.",
      "Despite sidelining the veteran holding midfielder for nearly two months, the two Portuguese speakers now enjoy a close relationship. That was evident when the former Real Madrid star embraced his manager after being substituted with nine minutes left in the second leg against Bilbao.",
      "The same report suggests that Ratcliffe and Ineos \"truly believe\" Amorim can restore United's success with a full pre-season and a squad overhaul. As a result, Amorim could be given over £100m to spend this summer, even if Spurs triumph in the final in Bilbao.",
      "Casemiro is expected to stay at Old Trafford beyond this season, with just a year left on his contract. His performances have sparked speculation about whether he will be offered a new deal.",
      "Meanwhile, the MEN reports that a return to Champions League football would boost Casemiro's wages back up to £300,000 per week.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games in the 2025/26 season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Rio Ferdinand has named eight Manchester United players who have shown signs of fitting into Ruben Amorim’s tactical system - despite the former defender believing the head coach would love to ship 10 stars out and bring in a similar amount this summer.",
      "United head into Wednesday night’s Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in a slightly more relaxed mood than their opponents but success or failure in Bilbao will determine how extensive the desired overhaul of Amorim’s squad will be this summer. Qualifying for the Champions League will increase the club’s budget significantly and attract bigger name players compared to if they are not in European competition at all next season.",
      "But Ferdinand does feel that a handful of players, led by club captain Bruno Fernandes, have shown they are able to succeed in Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "“I think he's got a lot of players,” Ferdinand said. “Bruno, (Alejandro) Garnacho, Amad, (Noussair) Mazraoui has done a decent job when he's come in, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire, (Matthijs) De Ligt, Casemiro, again, has adapted.”",
      "Ferdinand thinks it would be ludicrous for United to change head coach again if Amorim is unable to win tonight’s final against Spurs because he is yet to have a transfer window to shape his squad.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss is starting to receive criticism because of their dismal Premier League campaign, which has seen 18 defeats with a game to go.",
      "\"They've got to recruit not the best players, not the most talented players, the players that fit Amorim's style of playing, which is a physical style of player, dynamic, aggressive, powerful runner who can understand hus tactics.",

      "Louis Saha has branded Manchester United's midfield “shocking” and said it could be their downfall against Tottenham in tonight's Europa League final. Former United striker Saha – who also had a short spell at Spurs – said Ruben Amorim cannot afford to allow his midfield to be out-muscled, like they have been against Ange Postecoglou's side already this season.",
      "United have lost all three meetings with Spurs this season and Saha said Casemiro is the only hope the Red Devils have of controlling the midfield and ultimately emerging victorious.",
      "“In terms of what the score might be, I could see United winning 2-1 or losing 3-0, to be honest!” said Saha. “It's going to be a scruffy one for United, because Tottenham have a lot of things that United don't like. They're strong defensively and their transition is way better, as is their midfield.",
      "“But having someone like Casemiro in midfield - on his day - with all of his experience, might just balance things out a little. United need a strong midfield to turn up on Wednesday and that hasn't been the case against Tottenham in recent meetings.",
      ".",
      "“We've been out-powered by their midfield, to the point where I'd say it's been shocking at times. It's a tough final to predict because we're talking about two teams who know each other well. We've seen in the last few meetings between the two sides that Tottenham have been gaining dominance over United, so they should be favourites.",
      "“But in terms of history, how to manage a final, all of those kind of things, I'd say both clubs are in different positions and United are better equipped in this position. That's giving me confidence going into Wednesday's game. It's going to be interesting to see how the first 20 minutes pan out.”",
      "Saha, speaking exclusively to Ladbrokes, also claimed it makes a mockery of the tournament that one of United or Spurs, 16th and 17th in the Premier League, will be playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "“I don't really understand how either of these two teams can be playing Champions League football, because neither deserve to be, based on what we've seen from them this season,” said Saha. “But these are the rules, so there's not a lot you can do. It's not fair, when you compare it with some of the clubs in the league who will miss out on the Champions League.",
      "“That's only one side of it, though. United, if they win on Wednesday, might turn around and say 'we've still managed to reach the Champions League, despite all of our struggles this season'. It's not something I totally agree with, but it's a great opportunity for both clubs.”",
      "Reflecting on Tottenham's dismal season, which has seen them lose 21 times in the league, Saha said: “Tottenham are now sitting near the bottom of the table because of the mismanagement and an underestimating of needs.",
      "“It's not always about money and spending the most. Sometimes it's about the right people and the right players. That's not an easy job. The sporting director needs to anticipate these kinds of things, and that's an art in itself.”"

      "It's Europa League final day as Manchester United take on Tottenham Hotspur at the Estadio de San Mames in Bilbao.",
      "United are potentially just 90 minutes away from winning a major European trophy which will see a difficult season end on a really positive note.",
      "It would represent Ruben Amorim's first piece of silverware as United boss and victory also comes with the added boost of qualifying for next season's Champions League.",
      "But they face a Tottenham side who have also endured a difficult Premier League campaign and have the same motivation as United to end their campaign with a European trophy and Champions League qualification.",
      "We will be with you from Bilbao throughout the day as we bring you all of the latest build-up, updates, analysis and reaction from the Europa League final.",
      "Yoro and Dalot’s shirts are hung up in the dressing room. The Uefa cameras have had a sneak peek inside the United inner sanctum and those two seem to be in the squad, at the very least.",
      "Only three players from the 26 United have travelled with can miss out tonight as Amorim is permitted to name 12 substitutes. Dermot Mee is fortunate Ineos have funded a plane ticket for him to watch the game, never mind participate in the warm up.",
      "The three domestic games between the clubs this season count for nought. One was under Ten Hag, the other was a League Cup tie and United had a depleted bench at Spurs in February.",
      "More relevant than that is the ambience of this match. European finals feel different. It’s a neutral venue, there’s a ring of steel, there are fans outside the hotel etc. It is a dynamic United are accustomed to and have coped well with. Spurs are unaccustomed to it and winless in finals since 2008.",
      "Some supporters have already made their way into the stadium.",
      "Red, white and black tricolor flags have been placed on the seats of United fans. Some people will be all for that, others won’t be. It is a tad manufactured and United fans derided Chelsea for doing it for the 2008 Champions League final but fanbases and the makeup of fans change.",
      "One Athletic Bilbao fan is present with a sombrero on. Clearly, he was a tad overconfident. Some United fans and Spurs fans are sat among each other, which must be corporate-related.",
      "Diogo Dalot's presence in the travelling squad has given United a huge lift ahead of tonight's game. He was virtually an ever-present figure prior to his injury and his availability for a game of such importance cannot be understated.",
      "However, whether he will be fit enough to start or not remains to be seen. If he is deemed strong enough to make the starting line-up, his presence in the right wing-back spot will almost certainly see Noussair Mazraoui start as the right-sided centre-back. Harry Maguire is a shoo-in in the middle and then Leny Yoro, if he is fit enough to start, should start on the left.",
      "Amad is, of course, an option for the right wing-back berth, but he started Friday's defeat at Chelsea as the right-sided No.10 and that is where he should start tonight.",
      "Jonny Evans is on the bench for United tonight, which is no surprise at all, but he will have family backing in the stands. His brother Corry, himself a former United academy graduate, now plays for Oldham and he played 85 minutes at York last night as the Latics booked a spot in the National League play-off final with a stunning 3-0 win. He travelled back to Manchester, slept for a couple of hours and then hopped on a flight to Bilbao to watch Jonny and United.",
      "We'll bring you the starting teams at 6.45pm, so an hour and 15 minutes before kick-off.",
      "Here are the latest betting odds for tonight's game, courtesy of Bet365:",
      "Full Time Result:Tottenham 11/10, Draw 11/5, Man United 11/4To Lift the Trophy:Tottenham 13/10, Man United 8/13To Win on Penalties:Tottenham 9/1, Man United 10/1Result/Both Teams to Score:Tottenham – Yes 11/2, No 5/1Man United – Yes 7/2, No 11/4Draw – Yes 10/3, No 9/1To Win from Behind: Tottenham 12/1 / Man United 9/1To Win to Nil: Tottenham 5/1 / Man United 11/4To Win Either Half: Tottenham 11/10 / Man United 8/13To Win Both Halves: Tottenham 12/1 / Man United 6/1To Score in Both Halves: Tottenham 7/2 / Man United 12/5To Score Anytime:Bruno Fernandes 11/5Alejandro Garnacho 11/4Harry Maguire 10/1Heung-Min Son 11/4Dominic Solanke 12/5Brennan Johnson 7/2",
      "There's a conversation among supporters about whether Garnacho starts tonight. He was named on the bench against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and that starting XI will be close to what Amorim selects tonight. I think it would be a mistake not to start Garnacho. He opened the scoring against Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final and he is a genuine goal threat, despite his scruffy finishing.",
      "After what happened in the final few minutes of extra-time against Lyon in the second leg of the quarter-final last month, something inside of me is telling me that United are destined to come out on top this evening.",
      "United have had to live up to the 'Bilbao or bust' mantra for several months now, and they have passed every assignment that has come their way in their quest to reach the final. Now that they're here and kick-off is looming, they need to make sure it counts.",
      "The outcome of tonight's game will dictate which direction United's recruitment heads in over the summer, how quickly Ruben Amorim can rebuild the squad and the mood around the club ahead of next season. This is their biggest night in years.",
      "United’s run to Bilbao theoretically began at the Brick Community Stadium 500 days ago. That was when United won 2-0 at Wigan in the FA Cup third round last season. It was only winning that competition has led them here, as they qualified for the Europa League through the FA Cup. They have played 20 games since in the FA Cup and Europa League and lost none of them, somehow. One more win and a run of 21 ‘knockout’ games will lead them to the Champions League, despite the fact they continue to get worse in the Premier League.",
      "If the Inner-city jibbers firm still exist, they will have their work cut out to get near the San Mames tonight. As is commonplace for Uefa finals, a ring of steel has been erected around the stadium and the riot police were out in force when we arrived in Bilbao a couple of hours ago.",
      "It is a very calm atmosphere in the city. Athletic fans are understandably staying away and, as much of a cash-cow as the occasion is, one suspects the unfair reputation of English football fans will prove a deterrent for bar owners mulling over whether to remain open all hours.",
      "We walked past an Irish bar that was blaring out Bonnie Tyler. Some Spurs fans, all in colours, dined near us in a pizzeria and were very relaxed.",
      "It feels strangely subdued in Bilbao at the moment. The main square is reasonably lively and there’s a bit of a sing along but mostly United fans are in small groups having beers at various bars around Bilbao. The fan zone has been fairly sparsely populated and hasn’t looked to get close to its 20,000 capacity. We’re outside the stadium now. There is a ring of steel in terms of security and although there are supporters milling around, it’s still quiet. San Mames is right on the edge of the city centre so it is walkable even from the square and fan zone, so I don’t think it will get really busy here for another hour and a half or so.",
      "Amorim was relaxed during his press conference yesterday.",
      "\"I just think the best starting XI to start the game. It is then really important to have options on the bench to change the game. Sometimes it is really important to win a final,\" he said.",
      "\"I am not thinking about going to extra-time. Of course, we have that possibility, but we never think about that. In the beginning of the game, I just want to win the game really fast. But as we proved against Lyon, if we have to score three goals in six minutes, we are able to do it.\"",
      "Tottenham and United's only previous meeting in major European competition came in the 1963-64 Cup Winners' Cup last 16, with United progressing 4-3 on aggregate.",
      "United are winless in their last six meetings with Tottenham (D2 L4), and have lost the past three in a row.",
      "The Reds have never gone seven without victory against Spurs, and have also never lost four successive matches against them.",
      "Tottenham have won the Uefa Cup/Europa League twice (1972 and 1984) and victory would see them become the second English club to win it three times, along with Liverpool.",
      "This will be United's ninth major European final, with only Liverpool (15) reaching more among English clubs, but United have failed to win three of their past four.",
      "\"There hasn't been too many finals where there's been England opposition playing against each other. I was there in Moscow when we beat Chelsea,\" he said.",
      "\"Hopefully we can echo that kind of result tonight, although it would be a long night with penalties if it is like that. But it's a great occasion and our fans have travelled in numbers once again.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Roy Keane have both backed United to beat Tottenham in the Europa League final tonight.",
      "The two teams meet in Bilbao with European silverware and a place in next season's Champions League up for grabs. United and Tottenham have endured torrid domestic campaigns but can make this season one to remember for all the right reasons with a victory in Spain tonight.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "The big unknown here is the fitness of the three players who have returned to training this week. Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won't be fit to start.",
      "Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.",
      "Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn't risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.",
      "Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.",
      "Tyrone Marshall's Manchester United XI:",
      "There wasn't good news on Matthijs de Ligt. The defeneder has travelled to Bilbao with his teammates but will play no part in tonight's game, meaning the Dutchman and Lisandro Martinez are the only two United players to miss out through injury.",
      "While United will be missing just two players tonight, Spurs have bigger problems.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski picked up a knee injury against Crystal Palace recently and will miss the final having undergone surgery, with James Maddison also set to miss out. The latter has travelled with the squad, sparking talk that he could make a return from injury having been ruled out for the season. However, Ange Postecoglou confirmed Spurs' injury situation hasn't changed and so Maddison remains out of action.",
      "Postecoglou also confirmed that Lucas Bergvall is still sidelined. Radu Dragusin is a long-term absentee having ruptured his ACL in January and he will play no part tonight.",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "The biggest game of United's season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that's evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.",
      "I'd start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham's threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.",
      "Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.",
      "Eddie Thomas has been to the Nou Camp, Moscow and Stockholm and seen United win the lot.",
      "And we caught up with him in Bilbao ahead of tonight's final.",
      "Footage of a fracas between fans in Spain, ahead of the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham on Wednesday night, has been widely shared on social media.",
      "The two Premier League teams have the opportunity to redeem their disappointing domestic seasons when they face off at Athletic Bilbao's home ground tonight. A spot in next season's Champions League is also up for grabs, with tens of thousands of fans from both clubs travelling to Spain for the crucial match.",
      "However, amidst the generally friendly interactions in Bilbao, shocking footage of a brawl in nearby San Sebastian, where fans were seen throwing punches and objects at each other, has emerged.",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "The former Newcastle and England captain believes Tottenham will beat United in tonight's Europa League final.",
      "He told Betfair:",
      "This match is pretty impossible to predict when you look at how bad both teams have been. Spurs have done really well against Man United this season, so due to their record against them I'd say Spurs may be slight favourites.",
      "There are more negatives than positives for both teams when you look at them. I really haven't got a clue what to expect or what teams will turn up. It's a bit of a flip of a coin and it'll be a disaster for whoever doesn't win.",
      "Given what’s at stake for both clubs, it could have an impact on the game. There's so much relying on both teams, managers and both clubs' short-term futures.",
      "There's no exaggeration that both teams need an injection of five or six players to try and compete again and that's why the stakes of this game are enormous.",
      "Just because of their record over the last five or six games against them, and particularly this season, I'll go for a Spurs win. It wouldn't surprise me if the game goes all the way to penalties, but I'll go for Spurs to win in normal time.",
      "United have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro's availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final. Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn't. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade. You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.",
      "United and Spurs clashed last night in San Sebastian, 48 miles away from Bilbao, on the eve of the Europa League final.",
      "Spanish publication El Diario Vasco report the disturbances began around 9:20pm.",
      "Their report read:",
      "According to witness accounts and videos shared by residents, the incidents began with shouts and insults between groups of fans. The situation quickly escalated when one of the individuals punched another, causing the other to fall to the ground. Several fans subsequently began throwing objects taken from terrace tables, overturning one and using it as a weapon against another group. Drinking glasses and trash cans were also thrown, creating chaos and danger for passersby and local businesses.",
      "We will have more updates on this story as and when we get them."

      "Manchester United will be targeting Europa League glory when they face Tottenham Hotspur in the final at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao tonight.",
      "United have made it all the way to their third Europa League final in nine seasons boasting an impressive unbeaten run in the competition, winning nine and drawing five of their first 14 games, meaning they will be determined to jump the final hurdle and return to Manchester with silverware.",
      "Just like Spurs, United have endured a wretched Premier League campaign, meaning the opportunity to win the Europa League and secure Champions League qualification for next term would salvage something from their campaign.",
      "Regarding the team news, United head coach Ruben Amorim has taken a 26-man squad to Bilbao with him, which includes Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee, all of whom have recovered from injury issues to be involved.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up in the final:",
      "United have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro's availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final.",
      "Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn't. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade.",
      "You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.",
      "The big unknown here is the fitness of the three players who have returned to training this week. Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won't be fit to start.",
      "Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.",
      "Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn't risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.",
      "Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.",
      "The biggest game of United's season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that's evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.",
      "I'd start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham's threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.",
      "Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.",
      "Amorim has some tough calls to make in just about every position. Yoro's availability means he must start somewhere in the back-three, but there will be some debate about exactly where.",
      "I would start him on the left, as that was where he was flourishing prior to his recent injury. Maguire should start in the middle and Mazraoui is a logical candidate to start on the right amid Dalot's return.",
      "Dalot, if his fitness allows, should start at right wing-back and Dorgu is an obvious pick on the opposite flank. Casemiro and Ugarte have developed a good midfield bond in the Europa League and ought to start together in the engine room.",
      "Amad has to start after the season he has had, meaning he should operate in the right-sided No.10 role. Hojlund has struggled for goals all season and United, despite not testing the water recently, would be better off allowing Fernandes to lead the attack as a false-nine.",
      "As Samuel has already said, Fernandes has the ability to make something happen from just about anywhere on the pitch."

      "It's approaching 4pm in Bilbao on Tuesday. The sun is shining, and the noise is growing. But the noise has a distinctively cockney twang. In pockets on different streets approaching San Mames, Tottenham fans are cranking up the volume.",
      "As Spurs fans spill out onto the streets from one small bar near the ground, they start to wonder out loud where the United fans are. \"Where the f**k are Man United?\" is their Bilbao reworking of a song they often sing.",
      "A day before the Europa League final, it did feel like there were more Tottenham fans in the streets and bars of Bilbao, with a suggestion last week that they were expected to outnumber United fans on the money.",
      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",
      "There were dads and lads in the main fanzone, trying to kick footballs into boats on the Nervion River and queuing to have their photo taken with the Europa League trophy. There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",
      "\"I moved to Hong Kong for work, I don't get back for games often, but I had to be at this one,\" said the younger John.",
      "\"It took 20 hours to get from Hong Kong to Bilbao, but it's nice to be in the sun now. It's a really nice city, it's very friendly and seems like a nice place.",
      "\"I'm not that confident, I think it's going to be dull, 1-0 to United with a Fernandes penalty.\"",
      "They weren't the only father and son. Jonathan Law, from Worsley, stopped for a chat with his son Leo, and they will be hoping Leo's teachers aren't MEN readers after he admitted his son was skipping school to get a different kind of education this week.",
      "\"We just had to be here. We paid too much for the tickets, too much for the hotel, too much for the flights, but we're glad we're here. It's better than being at school,\" said Jonathan, with Leo nodding at that last comment.",
      "\"I'm confident, the closer it gets, the more confident I'm getting. It's United, isn't it? We can turn it on in certain games.\"",
      "Another Mancunian, Paul, was walking around the city with his son Jake. Although tempted, he decided against a chat as his son was also swapping school for watching United in a European final.",
      "One supporter who didn't pay too much for this journey was Nate, who was in Bilbao from Torbay in Devon. A stroke of good fortune had brought him to the city.",
      "\"I've been in Spain in my motor home for a month, I'm sailing back from Santander to Plymouth on Thursday. I booked the crossing six months ago, not realising United were going to get to the final,\" he said.",
      "\"When we booked it, I never booked it with this in mind, but as they progressed through the rounds, I realised there was a possibility they were going to get to the final. Bilbao in the semi-final was the big one to get over.\"",
      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",
      "The MEN are holed up in San Sebastian, and a few groups of United fans were in the city on Monday night. More arrived on Tuesday, and others are on the other side of Bilbao in Santander.",
      "Andrew Houten and his dad flew from Manchester to Nantes in the west of France on Monday. They then took the train further south to Bordeaux before getting a coach to Bilbao. They are staying in Zaramillo, a small village about 20 minutes outside of Bilbao.",
      "Richard, a United fan from Blackpool, found another way to beat the exorbitant flight prices. Just come earlier.",
      "\"I went via Berlin,\" he said. “The flights were difficult, and I'm going back via Mallorca. I saw quite a few United fans on the route out, and it's a Sunday night to Friday trip. I had to square it with the wife, although I made sure I booked it first!",
      "\"The atmosphere has been fairly tame so far, but we found a couple of bars on Monday that were quite lively. There was a good mix of United and Spurs. It's been very friendly so far.",
      "\"I can't say I'm feeling confident, I think it's going to finish about 1 in the morning.\"",
      "For those fans staying outside of Bilbao, the challenge of getting back to their accommodation will begin then. For now, they have the excitement of a matchday to come. And today, the Spurs fans might see a little more red in Bilbao."

      "Even while the question was being asked, Ruben Amorim was struggling to stifle a laugh. In fact, he found it so difficult to keep his composure that he had to reach for the glass of water in front of him. His chuckling started to set off Bruno Fernandes in the seat next to him.",
      "The subject of their fun sat on the other side of the United head coach. Harry Maguire has, in many ways, been the hero of this Europa League campaign. An injury-time equaliser at Porto and then that unforgettable winner in extra-time against Lyon that sent Old Trafford into a frenzy.",
      "There was also the twisting, turning dribble down the wing in this very stadium three weeks ago. He went one way, then the other, and then he whipped in a cross that ended with Casemiro setting United on their way to a Europa League semi-final cruise against Athletic Club.",
      "Manuel Ugarte flicked that cross on to Casemiro, so Maguire didn't actually get the assist, which is perhaps Exhibit A as to why these starts can be so worthless. Everyone knows the 32-year-old was the real hero of that goal.",
      "So it was that a journalist asked him if these \"inspirational moments\" in attack were all part of a new tactical plan. Amorim's laughter would suggest not, but Maguire played along.",
      "“The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" he said to laughter.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao and managed to put a good cross in and Casa scored the goal. Someone just asked me before, I’ve gone up front in the later minutes of a game. Hopefully tomorrow night I’m not going up front, I don’t want to be going up front and chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "“I’m always there to help and do my best, but I’m more than happy playing in my favoured position.\"",
      "Maguire will be a certain starter in that back three tonight, and it will be a reward for his years of service to United. Another question asked him how it felt to now be so important to this team when, for so long, the noise around him had been \"toxic.\" He swerved that one, but his recovery is one of the feel-good stories out of Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "It's easy to forget now, but the build-up to the Europa League final in Gdansk in 2021 focused on Maguire's fitness. He was nowhere near being fit, but United took him along and had him pictured in training to keep up the suspense.",
      "The next time United reached a cup final, he was a figure of fun, routinely jeered on pre-season tours and captain in name only. He was on the bench for the Carabao Cup final success in 2023 and came on for the final two minutes, sharing the trophy lift with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Maguire stopped to speak to reporters in the mixed zone at Wembley that day and insisted he was happy to be part of a trophy-winning United side after six years without silverware, but he must have been hurting at seeing his role reduced.",
      "\"I don’t have any mixed emotions, it’s been so long since the club won a trophy, it’s a really good day for the club and the fans,\" he said that day.",
      "\"I am club captain and my main job is to move this club forward and to bring success back to the club and today has been part of it. Obviously, listen, I am a footballer who wants to play games and I want to lead the boys out of the tunnel at the start of the game but also like I said I understand this is part and parcel of football when you play at the top level and you have got huge competition for places.",
      "\"It’s a real good day for the club and for me and a proud day for my family who were in the stands and saw me lift my first trophy for Manchester United.\"",
      "United were in an FA Cup final later this season, and Maguire didn't get off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City. A year later, he was injured for the Wembley win against Manchester City.",
      "So in four cup finals since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019, Maguire has missed two through injury and played a combined two minutes in the other. It sums up his fortunes at United.",
      "But over the last couple of years, the narrative has turned again. For all of those cup final disappointments, the winner against Lyon felt like his moment at United.",
      "“I've had some amazing moments at this club, been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest! It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed.\"",
      "Now, finally, Maguire will get to play in a cup final. He's no longer captain, but he's more of a leader now than when he wore the armband. He's had to wait for this moment, but few players deserve this final more than Maguire."

      "If it was strategic of Manchester United to allow Tottenham Hotspur to hold their pre-match duties first, it had the desired effect.",
      "Ange Postecoglou rounded on a reporter who suggested he could be remembered as a \"clown\". He dismissed concerns over his future, urging another reporter not to lose any sleep over it. He also reminded his audience he had lifted a trophy and exited stage left at his previous clubs.",
      "Sub-editors could design their back-page splashes hours before deadline. United's timekeeping for press conferences on the continent can be tardy but even if they were late Ruben Amorim was never going to be as quotable as his opposite number.",
      "Postecoglou entered the endgame some time ago. Sources have said he has known for months that he will not be managing Tottenham next season.",
      "Then there is Amorim, seemingly safe whatever the outcome in San Mames. Amorim is partial to a zinger but he was so relaxed that he joked Bruno Fernandes, sitting to his right, was after his job.",
      "That job is not in jeopardy. Amorim will be judged sooner than the two years he suggested it was fair to assess him at United. He has to oversee demonstrable improvement ahead of the trio of international breaks in September, October and November next season.",
      "He sounded borderline bewildered he was not as certain to be summoned to the guillotine as Postecoglou is. \"It's strange because you have some coaches that are here that lose some games and they are sacked. It's hard to explain,\" he shrugged.",
      "Not really. Ineos sought out every Tom, Dick and Harry to replace Erik ten Hag, watched United punch above their weight in the FA Cup final, had a leadership vacuum, lost their nerve and pandered to fickle fans.",
      "Once decision-makers were in the building and this season was becoming an extension of last season, they left emotion at the door. Ten Hag was never their man but Amorim is.",
      "In The Thick of It, Malcolm Tucker spells it out for the gaffe-prone minister Nicola Murray: \"The PM is not going to sack you after a week. Sacked after 12 months - looks live you've f****d up. Sacked after a week - looks like he's f****d up.\" The timeframes are different for the United brains trust and Amorim but the same logic applies.",
      "To dismiss Amorim after six months would be their f**k-up. Amorim has inherited an inadequate squad teeming with expensive errors and United have to purge it in the summer.",
      "He has reiterated that winning the Europa League this season cannot mask United's problems. Quite so. United have to be measured by their Premier League form: 16th, 18 defeats, -12 goal difference, no back-to-back wins. That would be relegation form in other seasons. Under Amorim, it is six wins out of 26 and 18 defeats. That is sackable form.",
      "But context is key. United assembled a Dutch-centric squad over three summers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's cabal inexplicably backed Ten Hag to the hilt despite all the evidence pointing to the contrary.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident but we already know the problems,\" Amorim explained. \"There's a lot of things that we need to change in our club. The way we do everything during the week in Carrington, the recruitment, the academy, I think we need to improve.",
      "\"So it's hard to point one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.\"",
      "This was a prosaic pre-match gathering, even with the majority of questions asked by the dedicated correspondents accustomed to Amorim's stock answers. He has been on repeat for several months as United's domestic form has remained consistently dire and, without any jeopardy surrounding Amorim's role, apathy has developed.",
      "He could afford to be chipper with Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt the only senior players absent from the travelling squad. De Ligt strolled around the San Mames pitch with teammates at 7pm but Amorim confirmed he is out.",
      "Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee will only be able to get \"limited\" playing time. Zirkzee last played 38 days ago, Dalot has been sidelined for a month but Yoro's foot injury was only ten days ago.",
      "Zirkzee's presence was a major surprise. Rasmus Hojlund has been hapless this calendar year, scoring three goals in 33 games. Amorim convinced Zirkzee, ruled out for the season with a hamstring injury five weeks ago, to make himself available as the only alternative striker, with Chido Obi ineligible and also not ready.",
      "\"They recovered quite well,\" Amorim remarked. \"They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to be part of the team and that is a very, very good sign.",
      "\"And it's very good for us. Of course they are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "The notion that Zirkzee could start ahead of Hojlund is unrealistic. United salvaged last season in the FA Cup final by dropping Hojlund in favour of a strikerless starting XI but that was in a 4-2-3-1, not the 3-4-2-1 Amorim swears by.",
      "\"Our system is the normal system that can change the characteristics,\" Amorim added. \"It's not about playing as a striker or without a striker. It's a system like any other that you can change the characteristics.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, different competition, different context, so everything was different. I just focused on the way we play, the way Tottenham play, what we can do to be better than the last two games.",
      "\"So that was my focus and not the last time that we won a cup.\"",
      "There was more levity when Maguire's dribble-and-cross against Athletic Bilbao was raised. Amorim and Fernandes were both giggling. \"The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" Maguire quipped. He stressed that he hoped he would not have to go up front on Wednesday evening.",
      "A European final is no occasion to be clowning around."

      "United's season will not be rescued by winning the second-tier European trophy but when we look back on this season in ten year's time, the result of this final will be remembered, not the torment of the Premier League. A spot in the next edition of the Champions League will be a huge achievement for Ruben Amorim considering the struggles he has had to navigate in just a short space of time.",
      "The main issue has been the squad he has inherited. This team was underperforming in the system it was built for - it was only going to get worse with an unfamiliar new tactic.",
      "Despite that, this squad has managed to rally on numerous occasions in the Europa League and it now stands on the edge of glory. Throughout this European campaign, it is fair to suggest that United have benefited from the element of surprise.",
      "Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad were not ready for the onslaught they received at the hands of United while the Lyon outcome remains a mystery to all those who witnessed it. Against Spurs, that surprise factor is mostly eradicated.",
      "This will be the fourth meeting between these two clubs this campaign and Tottenham have had United's number in all of the three previous fixtures. But while Spurs may feel they know what to expect from the Reds, Amorim is able to call on a secret weapon that nobody expected to be available to him - Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The Dutchman has had a tumultuous season for United and at times it seemed like the club was a step too far for him. However, he has dug deep since the turn of the year and suddenly became a player who Amorim could rely upon in big games.",
      "He scored against Real Sociedad and Lyon in the Europa League and has improved enormously now he is utilised in the No.10 role. Zirkzee's injury away at Newcastle looked to have ended his campaign altogether and yet, a miraculous recovery has made him an option for Amorim tonight.",
      "If he was to pop up with an important goal to cap off the season, it would be the perfect turnaround for the Dutchman and should provide him with huge confidence heading into the 2025/26 campaign. On December 30 he was at his lowest ebb after being jeered off the pitch.",
      "Recent weeks have seen Zirkzee linked with a summer move away from the club but, in Bilbao, he could save his Old Trafford career."

      "The 35 year old will join the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Glenn Hoddle, Robbie Savage and Paul Scholes on the panel for the Europa League final between Manchester United and his former team Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. Bale previously contributed to TNT Sport's Champions League coverage earlier this season and will be back behind the microphone this Wednesday evening.",
      "Bale retired at the age of 33 in 2023, leaving behind an illustrious career that saw him become one of the most decorated players of his generation and, in the eyes of many, the greatest British player ever, boasting 18 major trophies.",
      "Internationally, he earned 111 caps for Wales, netting a record 41 goals and guiding them to three significant tournaments - including their first World Cup appearance in 64 years in 2022.",
      "On the club front, Bale began his career at Southampton before rising to prominence at Spurs and securing a then-record £85 million transfer to Real Madrid in 2013. His stint in Spain yielded five Champions League titles and three La Liga crowns, before he concluded his playing days with an MLS Cup victory with Los Angeles FC, reports Wales Online.",
      "Even in retirement, Bale continues to dazzle with his superstar status, regularly sharing snapshots of dream holidays, glam showbiz events, and teeing off at the world's premium golf courses on social media.",
      "Here's a glimpse into the Welshman's luxe post-career lifestyle, complete with a dramatic physical transformation over time and life with his long-term love and wife.",
      "Two years after hanging up his boots, Bale's financial stature remains immense.",
      "At Real Madrid, the striker's salary was a staggering £600,000 per week, but he's not resting on those laurels – savvy business ventures ensure a steady income stream in his retired days.",
      "Bale launched 'Elevens', his own bar, in Cardiff back in 2017, followed by a mini-golf themed watering hole named Par 59, also in Cardiff, expanding the brand with an outpost in Bristol half a decade later.",
      "Despite being teetotal, the ex-athlete has made \"significant investment\" in Penderyn Distillery, taking a slice of ownership, alongside backing Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy's TGL golf league.",
      "Additionally, Bale's coffers have swollen thanks to lucrative endorsement contracts inked with titans such as Adidas, Playstation, and BMW over the span of his career.",
      "Estimating Bale's net worth is tricky, with reports pegging it around the £115 million mark.",
      "Nevertheless, the most recent Sunday Times Rich List did not include Bale in its '40 Under 40' lineup, indicating that his actual wealth might be less than £100 million.",
      "Gareth Bale wed his childhood love and former hairdresser, Emma Rhys-Jones, in 2019. The couple had already embraced three children—Alba, Nava, and Axel—by the time they exchanged vows, and they welcomed a fourth child, Xander, in 2021.",
      "The family is regularly seen jet-setting to opulent locations worldwide, with Bale sharing snaps of their holidays to Abu Dhabi, Lapland, and the United States of late.",
      "Their romance began at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, and they became engaged in July 2016 while celebrating Bale's birthday weekend, later marrying in the summer of 2019 on the secluded Spanish isle of Tagomago. Only around 60 guests were privy to the highly confidential ceremony, and it's said they were only informed of the exact venue a day prior and had to surrender their mobiles to former SAS security personnel.",
      "The union occurred following the reported postponement of their nuptials due to \"family turmoil\" involving Emma's relatives, which included her father being imprisoned and the death of her brother-in-law. Emma's sister, Katie, is married to Welsh rugby hero Taulupe Faletau, hence Bale's relation by marriage.",
      "Body transformation-wise, Bale has undergone an astonishing metamorphosis from the young Southampton debutant nearly 20 years ago to how he appears now at 35.",
      "While he was initially \"skinny and shy\" at the start of his career on the South coast, he quickly grew in both stature and confidence, reaching his physical prime after moving to Madrid. Photos of his muscular thighs and bulging biceps soon became a sensation on social media.",
      "Even in retirement, he has maintained his impressive physique, as evidenced by photos of him flaunting his toned torso and six-pack on an Abu Dhabi beach last year.",
      "However, it's not just Bale's physique that has evolved over the years; reportedly, he also underwent a procedure to pin back his ears. After enduring childhood teasing for his protruding ears, the Mirror reported in 2013 that the Welshman had \"discreetly\" visited a top plastic surgeon's clinic during the summer to have his ears pinned back.",
      "His hairstyle has also seen changes, with his once-famous top-knot now replaced by a more trimmed look compared to his playing days.",
      "After a career spanning the Championship, Premier League, La Liga and Major League Soccer, Bale has owned properties worldwide. Last year, reports emerged that his former Madrid mansion had been sold to global superstar Kylian Mbappe for a hefty £11 million.",
      "Gareth Bale's stunning £4 million abode in the Vale of Glamorgan can't be overshadowed, boasting not just six bedrooms, a dressing room and study but also featuring a bespoke three-hole golf course in its grounds.",
      "The custom-built course in his garden replicates some iconic holes; these include the 17th at Sawgrass, Royal Troon's 8th known as the 'postage stamp', and the famed 12th at Augusta National.",
      "Bale, whose affinity for golf is no secret, often graced the greens even during the peak of his footballing days, working his way to an impressive handicap of two.",
      "Since hanging up his boots, he's been able to spend even more time on his passion, playing rounds with none other than Masters champion Rory McIlroy, who has praised Bale's natural ability.",
      "\"He has the potential to get to scratch [a handicap of zero], the way he hits the ball he could be a scratch player, but he's only played for the last few years,\" McIlroy remarked following their game at a tournament last year.",
      "McIlroy noted the difference between simply striking the ball well and navigating the course adeptly: \"There is a difference between being able to hit the golf ball well and getting yourself around the golf course and managing your game – that's the part he's learning now.\"",
      "In addition to perfecting his game, Bale took on the role of ambassador for the Underrated Golf European Tour, established by NBA star Steph Curry, and has partnered with Adidas to produce golf-related content."

      "Eyewitnesses allege that tensions escalated after two opposing groups of supporters began trading insults. The situation quickly deteriorated, with fans throwing punches and objects, including a wheelie bin and drinks.",
      "One individual even overturned a table in an attempt to use it as a weapon before order was restored by the police.",
      "The report further states that no arrests were made, although police maintained a presence in the area. An ambulance was reportedly on standby, with 'several people' receiving treatment at the scene, but no one required hospitalisation.",
      "Tens of thousands of Brits have journeyed to Spain to back their teams, despite sky-high flight costs and a scarcity of available lodgings in the Basque region. The majority have conducted themselves well, with no significant disruptions before the incident in San Sebastian.",
      "It's estimated that thousands of supporters have made the trip without tickets for both teams' second-to-last match of the season.",
      "Supporters of both Manchester United and Spurs have witnessed their respective teams suffer disastrous seasons in the Premier League, where they currently sit 16th and 17th respectively, having lost a combined total of 39 matches. The victor of Wednesday night's match could become the lowest-ranked team ever to win a European trophy, a record currently held by West Ham, who finished 14th the year they secured the Europa Conference League."

      "Announcing his departure from Lille, Gomes wrote: \"After four unforgettable years at LOSC Lille, it’s time for me to say goodbye. This club has been more than just a team — it’s been a family, a home, and a place that has shaped me both on and off the pitch.",

Ahead of the final, transfer rumours have been floating around United regularly and while Matheus Cunha looks all but a done deal, some bits of business seem a bit further away from completion.",
      "In our look at the latest transfer news, we focus on the goalkeeper position and how that could be changing at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "After his emotional goodbye at Villa Park on Friday night, talkSPORT understands Emiliano Martinez is a player of interest for United. It is claimed that both the Reds and Atletico Madrid hold an interest in the Argentine who won the Yashin Trophy for world's best goalkeeper in the past two seasons.",
      "The report claims that Aston Villa are looking for £40m and United would only be able to afford the deal if they sell Andre Onana.",
      "What MEN Sport says: Martinez has undoubtedly been a good goalkeeper for Villa and Argentina. With four years remaining on his contract in the West Midlands, a £40m price tag seems understandable. However, United should probably avoid splashing such high amounts on ageing players. Martinez is 32 and while he could play for longer as a goalkeeper, it seems like a move that the Glazers would have green lit and very few of those paid off. Plus, while Onana has not been consistent this season, there are bigger priorities than replacing him.",
      "Speaking of Onana, TEAMtalk understands that United are offering out the Cameroonian ahead of the summer window. It is believed that United are actively seeking to sell the shot stopper and see Martinez as his perfect replacement.",
      "Neom SC, who will be playing in the Saudi Pro League next season, have reportedly been contacted over the possibility of signing Onana. However, it is thought that his high wage, even for Saudi clubs, is making many interested parties sceptical of submitting an offer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: If United can get £40m for Onana and use that money to purchase Martinez, that would be the only acceptable way to sign the 'keeper. They would make a profit on a signing who has flattered to deceive while also signing one of the world's best in the process. However, when the attack at United has yet to be resolved, questions surely still remain as to whether looking for a new goalkeeper is a good use of the recruitment team's efforts."

      "Manchester United have got “a real baller” on their hands in Joshua Zirkzee, who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",
      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The report states that the Ipswich striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal. I’d like him to calm his temperament down at times – you don’t want him getting sent off and costing his team games just because he’s losing his rag – but ability-wise I think he’s really good and a great addition to the squad.”",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing’ to offload one ‘recent signing’ after ‘just one season’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Serie A giants Inter Milan are ready to propose a loan move with an option to buy for Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee will be out for the rest of “this season” after picking up an injury of late.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly ‘re-evaluated’ his attacking options, and has decided to ‘keep’ one striker and ‘listen to offers’ for another."

      "",
      "Moises Caicedo to Chelsea (£115m – August 2023)\nEnzo Maresca’s suggestion that Caicedo is the “best defensive midfielder in the world” after a 1-0 win against *checks notes* Tottenham Hotspur was a bit of a stretch, but the 23-year-old has fared much better post-£100m transfer than most of his counterparts.",
      "The former Liverpool target’s second season at Stamford Bridge has been far stronger than his first and he’s one of the few huge Todd Boehly-era signings to pay off. He’s not quite justified the £100m player tag yet, but he’s getting there. He is Chelsea’s player of a poor season.",
      "",
      "Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea (£106m – January 2023)\nThis has comfortably been Fernandez’s best season to date at Chelsea, but that is not saying much. Like Caicedo, he needs to produce the goods more consistently if he’s to be considered an elite midfielder instead of one who’s purely very good on his day.",
      "Fernandez has found himself at the centre of transfer speculation concerning a deal that won’t come to fruition, with it incredibly difficult to see what he would add to what is already a well-stocked Real Madrid midfield.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Manchester City (£100m – August 2021)\nWe love Grealish, and you should too. He’s clearly a brilliant bloke and a gifted footballer, but even we have to admit that his time at Man City is coming to an end.",
      "Grealish’s immense form heavily contributed to Man City’s historic Treble season in 2022/23, but he’s not come close to matching this overwhelming peak in prior or subsequent campaigns.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s new favourite toy – Omar Marmoush – is the third attack-minded signing to outshine the England international after Jeremy Doku and Savinho and he desperately needs a new home to rediscover the magical performances he produced in his second season and for Aston Villa.",

      "",
      "Paul Pogba to Manchester United (£89m – August 2016)\nEven with Man Utd’s woeful downfall this season, you are hard-pressed to find a former Red Devils player-cum-pundit desperate enough to call for Pogba to be given a “third chance” at Old Trafford, with Dwight Yorke one exception.",
      "Pogba is arguably the most talented footballer on this list, so the massive investment of £89m to re-sign him from Juventus could have been justified at the time. But the story of his second stint at Man Utd – marred by manager fallouts and a stinking attitude – should give him no hope of another chance, even with Sir Jim Ratcliffe supposedly ‘betting on’ free agents this summer.",
      "",
      "Angel Di Maria to Manchester United (£59.7m – August 2014)\nAnother contender for being Man Utd’s worst signing post-Sir Alex Ferguson, Di Maria is a fine example of an individual who proves the club has become a “graveyard for coaches and players”.",
      "Di Maria joined Man Utd riding the crest of a wave after shining in the previous season’s Champions League final, but he flopped at Old Trafford and could not leave quickly enough, joining PSG after a single season in the Premier League.",
      "His success after exiting Man Utd suggests the club were the problem, not him, as there are only two Old Trafford departees post-Ferguson who have done better.",

      "Fernando Torres to Chelsea (£50m – January 2011)\n“This was the no-brainer. This was the banker, this was the one that couldn’t fail, this was the one that’s never failed.” Well, it did…",
      "Chelsea appeared to pull off a major coup when they snatched Liverpool’s goal machine from their arch-rivals, but it turned out his legs had gone as he only scored 20 goals in 110 Premier League games for the Blues. He at least has that Champions League semi-final goal to lean on, though.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "The Red Devils have a lot of work to do during this summer’s transfer window as they look to make wholesale changes to their squad.",
      "This is required with Man Utd’s current squad not fully suited to Ruben Amorim‘s preferred 3-4-3 formation, while most of their players have not done enough to justify sticking around beyond this summer.",
      "Results in the Premier League have been abysmal this season as they could finish 17th, but they could still salvage something from this campaign as they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "A trophy, Champions League football and a huge injection of cash are up for grabs in the Europa League final, so a victory should set Man Utd or Spurs up for a significant upturn heading into next season.",
      "READ: Man Utd and Spurs so stupid they’ve broken the supercomputers ahead of Europa final",
      "Man Utd are currently miles away from challenging for the Premier League title, with upgrades required in most positions.",
      "It has been widely reported that United’s priority is to strengthen in forward positions this summer, with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap among their preferred targets.",
      "Now, a report from The Times claims Man Utd ‘will have £100m to spend even if Spurs win the final’, though club chiefs believe this budget could reach £200m via selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "The report deems this viewpoint a ‘tad optimisic’, with Chelsea and Aston Villa not guaranteed to sign Sancho and Rashford permanently. Regarding Sancho, it’s noted that Chelsea ‘could prefer to pay a £5million penalty’ instead of investing £25m to make his deal permanent.",
      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",
      "‘The striker Liam Delap, who is available for £30million after Ipswich Town’s relegation, is a target while the wingback positions need strengthening and Bayindir is likely to be sold to make way for another goalkeeper to rival Onana for the No1 jersey.’",
      "It is also revealed that Man Utd’s summer transfer window ‘will be led by the technical director Jason Wilcox’, with INEOS ‘happy with his work so there are no plans to recruit a director of football’.",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by sanctioning pure profit exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, but they ‘will only leave if a club makes a substantial bid for either’. While the latter is ‘most likely to depart’, the Red Devils ‘would like to keep both players’.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world’s best. The bravado that made him so might not work at Man Utd if he replaces Andre Onana…",
      "Man Utd and Chelsea could face fresh competition for the signature of Liam Delap from a fellow Premier League club, according to reports.",
      "Matheus Cunha “loves Man Utd”. It gives them an advantage, but the Brazilian might be part of the last generation who see them as special.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League."

      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s ‘main reason’ for their decision on whether to sack Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim replaced former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 and has endured a turbulent few months at the Premier League giants.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss was initially keen to wait until this summer to make the move, but he decided to join early after being given an ultimatum by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and United‘s board.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation as Man Utd’s current squad is not suited to this set-up and performances in the Premier League have been shambolic.",
      "Man Utd’s results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag in the league, as they are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League with one game remaining.",
      "READ: Man Utd losing Europa League will lead to ‘relegation and even bankruptcy’",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd’s best performances have come in the Europa League as they have reached the final.",
      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a shock boost ahead of their Europa League final with Spurs, as some key players were pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "One Man Utd player is getting frustrated that INEOS and Ruben Amorim are not playing him in order to get him to leave the club, according to reports.",
      "A report reveals how Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim was ‘talked out’ of handing in his resignation after a 3-1 home defeat to Brighton in January.",
      "Neville insists it’s too early to judge Amorim and Ratcliffe at Man Utd and picked the ‘six players minimum’ required in a Red Devils rebuild this summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has done nothing to suggest he can turn Man Utd around, while there is some laughter and anger about Man City."

      "Come on, AceOdds. Come on, boffins. Brainiacs, eggheads; what’s going on here? What’s the crunch of these numbers? Is it 2-1 or 3-2?",

      "The true nonsense here is that McEvoy’s article is broadly fine, hoping that Gary Lineker’s departure doesn’t signal an unnecessary and damaging broader shift in Match of the Day’s overall style and focus.",
      "And unlike other Daily Mail fears, this one is not entirely unfounded. There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",
      "… the amalgam of both, the action dominating with the reassuring-as-old-slippers insight of the pundits as an accompaniment. This diet is distinct from both the protracted analysis of Sky’s ‘main event’ and the unvarnished 10-second video clip trotting across personal smartphones.",
      "But after several hundred words of reasonableness, McEvoy makes his fatal error – or Machiavellian click-generating move, choose your fighter – that presumably made a sub-editor punch the air in delight.",
      "Nobody, even among the small ‘c’ conservative Saturday night audience, is opposed to innovation and judicious tinkering. But the great hope is that change for its own sake, such as box ticking and wokery, or indeed a bellyful of laddishness, is left at the studio door.",
      "Please, can someone explain to us what on earth ‘wokery’ even means in this context?",

Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him.

In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",

There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions.

One source has even told us that he believes the deal is very close and that the player would be happy to move to Manchester United, even though United aren’t having a great season. He still feels they’re a big, big club.",

For instance, whether Chelsea are going to be in the Champions League, and whether Manchester United will be. But I think, regardless of that, I get the feeling the player would be up for moving to United, even if they don’t make the Champions League.”",

      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "Liverpool are stepping up their interest in RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with Darwin Nunez expected to leave this summer, according to reports.",

      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",

      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",
      "Manchester United have been told why they need to “look beyond their rift” with Liverpool and sign £64m flop Darwin Nunez this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd’s Andre Onana features twice, but one Brighton player has a hat-trick of shame in this ranking of the worst performances in this season’s Premier League.",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and come out well on top.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made an offer for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after Unai Emery offered no assurances over his future at the club.",
      "A weekend of emotional farewells had us say goodbye to Goodison Park, Jamie Vardy, Emiliano Martinez, the old Arsenal and very possibly West Ham soon."

      "Ruben Amorim has been consistent in his message that not even winning the Europa League can save Manchester United’s season.",
      "Maybe he’s right. The fact they sit 16th in the league, with scope to slump further, remains a mind-melter when you actually stop and think about it. This is, after all, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And unlike with Spurs, whose own league efforts are somehow even worse, there is not the same sense at United that a trophy – any trophy – makes everything worth it. United don’t need another season where the cracks of wretched league form are papered over with a trophy. They had one of those last season, and have spent this season paying for it.",
      "But what beating Tottenham in Bilbao might do for Man United is far more significant than the outcome of a single season. This, really, feels like where the divergence exists between these two finalists who sit next to each other so miserably back at home.",
      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

      "",
      "There are some positives though…\nSo here we stand on the precipice of glory or failure. Win and the season will be marginally acceptable, lose and it will be confirmed a disastrous campaign. This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter. A trophy and CL place would, however, be a start and buy him some further support.\nGarey (come on United!!) Vance, MUFC",

      "Is Frimpong that odd of a potential signing?\nYouth development is never linear; as good as Bradley has been, he isn’t consistent. Defensively he was excellent against Mbappe and bloody terrible against Martinelli. He’s been Cafu incarnate going forward, whilst also showing the inadequacies of Abel Xavier in some moments.",
      "For every youth prospect that excels, like a Gravenberch, there’s a youth prospect that excels and then stalls, like Bajcetic. Both may well thrive, but relying on one was foolhardy and didn’t work and relying on the other did work – though entirely out of luck rather than judgement.",
      "There is a difference between giving youth a chance with an opportunity that’s still safe to fail, and relying on youth and then their struggles hamper the whole team, the compounding pressure of that then destroys their career.",
      "Gravenberch saved the day this season but it was a forced gamble, rather than a plan that should be scaled. Beyond that, perpetually play a kid in every game, and you’ll break them as LFC did with Owen and Arteta may well do with Saka.",
      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",
      "Not everyone’s career ends up like Gareth Bale’s but the prospect of playing an attacking full back further forward isn’t entirely new, and not entirely unsuccessful. Riise was instrumental in Istanbul after all.",
      "Final thing would be that at circa thirty million, in today’s world of utterly ludicrous prices, that’s not too extravagant, and albeit losing Trent for buttons is a huge dropped-bollock, having two people replace him for an all-in cost of 30 million does repair that damage somewhat.",
      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available. The inverse to that logic though is your main target’s price tag could/would swell to fill your entire budget if you wait forever, as your negotiating position is reduced: folks will know how much money you have.",
      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",

      "French champions Paris Saint-Germain have previously been linked with Gyokeres, but the report says they ‘no longer seem to be in the race’. Luis Enrique apparently does not want to sign a new striker, ‘and even less so an expensive player’, it’s said.",

      "Manchester United have once again been handed a two-star food hygiene rating after mouse droppings were found in several hospitality areas at Old Trafford, despite months of efforts to clean up the stadium’s catering operations.",
      "The latest inspection, carried out by environmental health officers in mid-April, revealed evidence of mice in ‘seven areas across the stadium’, including high-end suites such as the Ambassador Lounge, the Manchester Suite, and the Number 7 Suite, as per the Daily Mail, who ‘has seen the inspection report from environmental health experts’.",
      "In some instances, droppings were discovered ‘under the buffet bar’, raising serious concerns about hygiene in spaces that serve food to thousands of supporters.",
      "The Number 7 Suite, described by the club as ‘one of the most stylish spaces’ in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, starts at £550 per person. The Manchester Suite, where a ‘large number of droppings’ were reportedly found, typically costs around £600 per head.",
      "This marks the continuation of a worrying trend, after United’s rating dropped from four to two stars back in November, prompting a series of internal measures to improve cleanliness and pest control.",
      "In response to the latest findings, a Manchester United spokesperson said the club ‘implements a robust pest-control system’ and carries out ‘multiple weekly checks’ across all catering zones.",
      "They added: ‘Stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served,’ and that ‘immediate and appropriate action’ is taken if any incidents occur.",
      "Old Trafford’s ageing infrastructure and high footfall – with more than 250,000 people dining at the stadium each season – have contributed to what inspectors labelled a significant challenge.",

      "The stadium houses 29 kitchens and catering facilities, meaning problems in any area can affect the overall rating.",
      "Inspectors also highlighted other hygiene concerns, including ‘dirty’ areas and improper food labelling.",
      "One cited case involved a container of pesto labelled for use over a month, despite the manufacturer stating it should be consumed within eight days. These issues are reportedly being ‘addressed immediately’.",
      "Despite the renewed two-star rating, the inspection report acknowledged that ‘significant work has taken place to control the mice activity’, but urged United to ‘persevere with the measures being implemented to eradicate activity within food areas.’",
      "A Manchester United spokesperson said: ‘Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford.",
      "‘Multiple weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served.",

      "The former Manchester City youngster would ideally prefer to return to the north west, but will consider a number of factors including the chance to play in Europe next season.",
      "Eddie Howe is in the market for another striker, with Callum Wilson expected to leave and the demands of European football next season placing added pressure on leading scorer Alexander Isak.",
      "Delap’s strong campaign at a struggling Ipswich side has caught the eye, with 12 goals in 35 Premier League appearances enough to convince several top-flight clubs that he is ready for a step up.",
      "MORE TRANSFER NEWS ON F365…\n👉 Strong exit hint boosts Liverpool transfer chances as journalist ‘keeps hearing’ same rumour\n👉 Rooney tells Man Utd to sign two top Chelsea targets after Romano gives ‘here we go’ to first signing\n👉 ‘Desperate’ Arsenal ‘line up’ surprise transfer for Chelsea flop after Liverpool ‘initiate discussions’",
      "The Magpies’ interest is long-standing, but the decision to push for face-to-face talks this week signals a shift in intent. The club have been assessing striking options for months, and Delap now appears to be high on the shortlist.",
      "Delap is believed to prefer staying in the north west, having joined Man City as a teenager and spent the last few years based in the region.",
      "But speaking on talkSPORT, former England striker Darren Bent summed up one potential concern at Old Trafford. “Double Hojlund, yeah?” he said, referencing the potential similarities between the youngster Delap and the Danish forward who has struggled at times to lead the line alone.",
      "United fan Andy Goldstein was even more direct. “I think he’s a really good player, I don’t think he’s the finished article just yet,” he said. “And we’ve got a Liam Delap [in Hojlund], and it’s not working at the minute. We’ve got a Liam Delap. I think two of them is not the answer.”",
      "The comments echoed Jamie Carragher’s warning earlier this week, when he suggested Delap would be better served taking an intermediate step, such as Everton, before joining a top-six club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",
      "Liam Delap would rather join Man United than Chelsea, or he would rather join Chelsea than Man United. It all depends whether you believe The Sun or… The Sun.",
      "Liam Delap to Manchester United is “very close” despite interest from Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United, according to reports.",
      "Ex-Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has picked out two ideal signings for his former club, who need “ten” additions to get back on track."

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11; Value is found in the fouls market where history suggests Europa League finals are foul frenzies; Follow the final via our live match blog from Bilbao on Wednesday",
      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 09:09, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",
