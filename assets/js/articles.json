      "Alejandro Garnacho has backed up his promise after turning down a move to Bayern Munich. The Argentine is surplus to requirements at Manchester United after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "However, Garnacho has previously made it clear that it is Chelsea or nobody as he risks missing out on a move before the end of the window. The Blues are keen to sign the forward, but remain around £10million away from United’s valuation.",
      "The Red Devils want around £40m for the 21-year-old, with Chelsea - thus far - failing to go beyond £30m. Garnacho is part of the bomb squad at Carrington, which also included Marcus Rashford before his move to Barcelona.",
      "He hasn’t played a competitive match since going public with his frustrations after starting on the bench in the Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao. He said back in May: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "Stamford Bridge bosses have already spent big this summer, signing Jamie Gittens for £48.5m, spending £65m on Joao Pedro, paying £37m for Jarrel Hato and sanctioning the £30m transfer of Liam Delap.",
      "But Enzo Maresca is still in the market for more firepower and would like Garnacho, with the player similarly desperate to make the move. But the Premier League giants are unable to make any further incomings without sanctioning exits first - which had opened the door for German champions Bayern.",
      "The Times report that Bayern explored the possibility of signing Garnacho, but were quickly informed he only wants to sign for Chelsea. Bayern had previously been linked with Christopher Nkunku, who Maresca is happy to sell this summer, but saw a loan offer rebuffed.",
      "They want a permanent sale on the books and could yet get their wish. The Athletic report that the forward’s former club RB Leipzig are stepping up talks to re-sign Nkunku in what would be a permanent transfer.",
      "Nicolas Jackson could also help bolster Chelsea’s transfer kitty, with Aston Villa ready to go head-to-head with Newcastle for his signature.",
      "Chelsea want around £60m for the Senegal striker who has fallen down the pecking order thanks to this summer’s business. Manchester United and Arsenal had been linked previously, but a Premier League switch could still be on the cards.",
      "Maresca is hoping for a busy end to the window with not only Garnacho arriving and exits completed, but also the acquisition of a new defender.",
      "Levi Colwill is set to miss the majority of the season after undergoing surgery on his ACL and although there are options behind him, Maresca made it clear he wanted different options.",
      "\"I think we need a central defender,” he said last week, “We are looking for an internal solution but as I said, the club know exactly what I think.\"",
      "Asked again after their opening day draw with Crystal Palace, the Italian said: \"You like to talk about central defenders? I already spoke. Thank you very much.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been given a hint that Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa could be available for a cut-price fee. The Red Devils have a goalkeeping issue to address after Ruben Amorim dropped Andre Onana for Altay Bayindir in the team’s opening defeat to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United showed signs of improvement against the Gunners at Old Trafford, with much of the home fans’ excitement centred around seeing their new attacking signings make their league debuts. However, Amorim’s side came away without a share of the points after a mistake from Bayindir gifted Arsenal defender Riccardo Calafiori the winning goal.",
      "United have been linked with moves for PSG ’s Gianluigi Donnarumma and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez during the transfer window. However, Porto shot-stopper Costa could be the man to solve United’s problem position after being the subject of a surprising transfer bid.",
      "Sky Germany reports that Galatasaray have submitted a £17million bid for Costa, which is expected to be rejected by Porto. It is claimed that the Turkish side view the Portugal number one as an alternative target as they continue to pursue a deal for Manchester City star Ederson. The club's focus on Costa and initial offer suggests they think they could sign the keeper for a relatively low fee.",
      "Costa, 25, has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, having reportedly been among the options to succeed David De Gea at United before Onana joined the club in 2023. The goalkeeper is said to have a £63m buy-out clause in his contract, which has two years remaining.",
      "While Galatasaray’s offer will likely not be accepted, it shows that Costa could be available at a bargain price - and much cheaper than what United have been previously quoted for him - considering his pedigree. This could also present a simple solution for United, given City are reportedly rivalling the Red Devils for Donnarumma’s signature.",
      "It seems that Amorim does not have complete faith in Onana after leaving the former Ajax and Inter Milan star out of United’s matchday squad at the weekend. When asked if Onana’s omission was due to fitness concerns, Amorim said: \"No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.”",
      "Bayindir took his place in goal for United but did little to stake his claim for being the team’s long-term number one. The 27-year-old has made just 12 appearances for United since arriving from Fenerbahce two years ago. His actions leading up to Arsenal’s winning goal were criticised by club icon Roy Keane.",
      "“You get in their face. Be aggressive. I've said it many times for a goalkeeper - come with violence. Take control of it. Far too easy. It’s like schoolboy stuff. Man United - weak and soft.\"",
      "Keane’s ex-team-mate, Gary Neville, echoed the thoughts of the former United captain. The pundit explained that he was in favour of United targeting either Donnarumma or Martinez due to their presence and personality, aspects he feels are lacking in the club’s current goalkeeper options.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters,” he said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.”",

      "Sean Dyche claims he would make a better Manchester United manager than Ruben Amorim - pointing to his trusted 4-4-2 formation as the key to success. Despite being known for his no-nonsense, old-school style, the former Everton and Burnley boss believes he could excel at a club like United if given the chance.",
      "\"I may get hammered for it, but I bet I could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2,\" Dyche told ex-England manager Sam Allardyce on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. \"People keep talking about his [Amorim's] philosophy and it isn't working. It's fine getting to five or 10 games, but once you get to 20 games, it clearly isn't working.\"",
      "After nine months in the Old Trafford hotseat, Amorim has won just 16 of his 43 matches in charge, giving him a win rate of just 37 per cent - only slightly higher than Dyche's career average of 34 per cent. He has also struggled to implement the fluid, high-octane style that defined his Sporting CP side, with United's squad finding it difficult to adapt to Amorim's three-at-the-back system.",
      "In a bid to address this, United have splashed over £200million on a brand-new front three this summer and spent £26m in January on Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back suited to Amorim's style. Dyche believes this is evidence that United don't currently have the squad to play Amorim's way, though he praised the club and its head coach for sticking to their principles.",
      "\"I might be wrong because they've brought in three big hitters this summer, so it wouldn't work with the players they had, but maybe the new players will do better,\" he said.",
      "\"On the one hand, I like the fact they're sticking with it, and it is Man United. You're under massive pressure to get it right. But on the other hand, you wouldn't normally survive that situation. Amorim's been given more time than most.",
      "\"People forget that in Pep's first season, he made so many changes to the squad and played so many formations and finished 13 points off the top, nobody blinked. If he was at Real Madrid, he would have been sacked. But he learned and won the Premier League the next season.\"",
      "Dyche's record in the Premier League demonstrates his ability to overperform with limited resources. At Burnley, he consistently transformed modest squads into disciplined, competitive teams, steering them clear of relegation and even pushing close to European qualification.",
      "His teams were always difficult to beat, well-organised, and capable of exceeding expectations despite financial and squad constraints.",
      "At Everton, Dyche faced a different set of challenges, navigating financial problems while maintaining competitiveness and stability. His pragmatic, hard-working approach allowed him to keep teams solid and focused, even when expectations were low.",
      "Yet despite these achievements, Dyche has never been given the opportunity to manage an elite club capable of playing expansive, attacking football. It's hard to say whether his confidence in successfully implementing a 4-4-2 system at United is entirely justified, but his track record of achieving under limiting circumstances speaks volumes.",
      "The Red Devils spent much of last season perilously close to the relegation zone, losing 18 times and finishing 15th in the table. Amorim will hope for much better this season, but despite an improved performance, his United side started the new season with a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal.",

      "Jadon Sancho has already experienced plenty of transfer drama as the winger remains in limbo over his Manchester United future. The winger is one of several players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, but he is currently still a United player.",
      "The 25-year-old joined as a blockbuster signing in 2021 following his starring displays for Borussia Dortmund. Yet Sancho's time with the Red Devils has proved disappointing, with the England international spending recent seasons back at Dortmund and on loan to Chelsea.",
      "Sancho is likely to leave United this summer and was presented with two offers this week from Roma and Besiktas, but turned down both moves. The 25-year-old expects more opportunities to arise before the window shuts, but his high wage demands could complicate potential moves. With Sancho's future up in the air again, we take a look back at the transfer sagas involving the winger...",
      "Coming through the youth system at United's rivals, Manchester City viewed Sancho among the club's brightest academy talents. Although Pep Guardiola admitted he was keen to retain Sancho, the then-17-year-old winger was said to have gone back on a handshake agreement to sign a new contract before completing a move to Dortmund in his quest for regular minutes.",
      "\"We offered him a huge deal and we shook hands,\" Guardiola said after Sancho's departure was confirmed in 2017. \"But before we went to the States, he said, 'I am not going to sign.'\"",
      "Sancho never made a first-team appearance for City, but quickly thrived at the German outfit following his £8m switch. He scored 50 goals and provided 64 assists across 137 outings for Dortmund, though Guardiola maintained he held no resentment towards Sancho for choosing to leave City.",
      "\"I've said many times, it is not a regret,\" Guardiola said in 2021. \"He decides. He's doing really well. Congratulations, he's an exceptional player. He is a national team player with huge quality, doing really well in Dortmund.",
      "\"We wanted him to stay but he decided to leave, and when people decide to leave all we can do is (let them) leave. I wish him all the best, except when he plays against us. No regrets at all. If he's happy, I'm happy.\"",
      "United had tried to secure Sancho's signature a year before his eventual arrival at Old Trafford. In 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team reportedly tabled an opening £73m bid, potentially rising to £91.3m, but this came up short of Dortmund's £108m valuation.",
      "\"I wasn't 100 per cent expecting him to stay, but I hoped he would,\" Burki told Kicker. \"It has always been clear that you have to pay a certain amount of money to buy a player of his quality, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, it's not as easy for the clubs as it was before.",
      "\"I don't believe Jadon is sad that he will continue with Borussia Dortmund. He comes to training with a smile on his face and is happy to be with us. Jadon is still a top player next year.",
      "\"Time is not running out for him. Besides, he has developed as a personality. I am not aware of any current events that give cause for criticism. Jadon hasn't done anything wrong in two and a half weeks of pre-season so far.\"",
      "United eventually secured his signature the following summer for £73m to finally bring an end to one of the longest transfer sagas in recent memory.",
      "Sancho is currently hunting for a new club after Chelsea opted against making his loan spell permanent. Enzo Maresca's team were forced to pay a £5m penalty fee to United having previously agreed an obligation to buy worth up to £25m.",
      "The ex-Dortmund ace featured 41 times as Chelsea secured fourth spot in the Premier League and claimed the Europa Conference League crown last season, chipping in with five goals and 10 assists. Yet the Blues chose to pay £5m rather than sign him on a permanent basis, instead bringing in Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and Brazilian wonderkid Estevao this summer.",
      "This isn't the first time Sancho has had to make a return to United. After a disagreement with former United manager Erik ten Hag, Sancho was loaned out to Dortmund in January 2024. Despite making 21 appearances and even starting in the Champions League final, Dortmund were unable to secure a permanent deal for the forward.",

      "Italian giants Atalanta are closing in on a deal for Lecce striker Nikola Krstovic after a £40million deal for Rodrigo Muniz fell through. Fulham have been resolute in saying they must bring in a replacement before allowing Muniz to leave and talks have now collapsed.",
      "The news comes as a blow to Manchester United as Fulham were considering a move for out-of-favour striker Rasmus Hojlund as a potential replacement for Muniz. Hojlund will be allowed to leave Old Trafford after the Red Devils spent £200m on a new forward line this summer of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Hojlund was left out of the squad for United's opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday, with Cunha starting up front and Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee making the bench. When asked about Hojlund's absence, Ruben Amorim said: \"It is going to be like this during the season.",
      "\"We have more options, we have to choose the right players for each game. Sometimes, it's not just thinking about 11 guys that start the game and imagine how we are going to finish the game and win the game.",
      "\"They are in moments of a few training sessions for Josh and, with Sesko, he changed his life in one week. We tried to choose the best team to start and then, during the game, we will see.\"",
      "AC Milan, though, are looking to sign a new striker this summer and sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club are interested in Hojlund. Speaking to Sport Mediaset, Tare said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us.",
      "\"We are evaluating him these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable. We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they must be players who can give something more to this group.\"",
      "Hojlund joined United from Atalanta for a fee of around £72m back in 2023, but he has struggled to make much of an impact after managing just 26 goals in 95 appearances across all competitions.",
      "However, when asked about his future earlier this summer, Hojlund said: \"I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland ).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Newcastle and Villa remain live possibilities with Jackson likely to go before the window shuts on September 1. It will give Chelsea new spending power as they look to bring in RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons and they remain keen on Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho even if they are at least £10m apart on valuation.",
      "The Blues have already spent big on Jamie Gittens, £65m on Pedro, they paid £37m for Jorrel Hato and £30m on Delap while they had already long since done a deal for Brazil teenager Estevao Willian.",
      "But they will carry on spending big with Argentina international Garnacho in their sights although United want over £40m while Chelsea know he is not in Ruben Amorim’s plans and their valuation is closer to £30m.",

      "Blues boss Enzo Maresca has made it very clear that he wants a new defender - with Levi Colwill out injured - but the club make a habit of investing in forwards.",
      "Chelsea’s habit of buying and selling to keep the finances turning over has worked to a degree but it is also the reason why Jackson and a raft of other players find themselves available for the right price.",
      "They are not in a rush to sell Jackson but equally if he wants to go - with Pedro and Delap seemingly ahead in the pecking order and ready for Maresca’s rotation policy - then they are open to a sale.",
      "It is Jackson’s agents who are now trying to find the right club for the striker who joined for £30m two years ago from Villarreal and has had mixed fortunes. But his strength, goals and potential to improve is why clubs are attracted to the 24-year-old who has 24 goals in 65 games.",
      "Chelsea are also looking to offload Raheem Steriing as the England international has two years left on his current deal and is currently training with the “loan group.” There seems no way back for Sterling who would prefer a move in London after spending last season at Arsenal but would be open to the right offer. Fulham could be an option.",
      "Chelsea have rejected a loan approach from Bayern Munich for Christopher Nkunku as they would prefer to do a permanent deal. However, there is a belief that he is likely to go for £35m-plus which again provides Chelsea with more turnover and cash as they look to shake up the squad again.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are likely to come back for Carney Chukwuemeka after seeing one bid turned down. Ben Chilwell also wants a fresh start to get his career back on track while Axel Disasi, Renato Veiga and Tyrique George could also go before the end of the window.",

      "The 2025-26 Premier League season has officially kicked off with all 20 teams having played their opening matches. Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Super Sunday in arguably the biggest game of the weekend, while Manchester City looked rejuvenated as they secured a 4-0 triumph over Wolves on Saturday evening.",
      "By that point champions Liverpool had served notice of their title intentions, Arne Slot's men winning 4-2 against Bournemouth on Friday night thanks to late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. If Chelsea are to be contenders, they'll need to be much better than their goalless stalemate with Crystal Palace, where VAR controversy stole the headlines.",
      "So, it's one week down and 37 rounds of matches to go before this season's climax. But before we move forwards, with help from stats specialists Opta, we've taken a look at the opening weekend of action and compiled a table based on the expected goals for each team. Expected goals (xG) is a metric calculated based on the value of opportunities and shots on goal from each Premier League team and has become a widely-used measure to evaluate teams and performances. It provides an estimate of the number of goals a team should have theoretically scored.",
      "Unsurprisingly it is City who top the xG table after their thumping win at Molineux. They registered 2.5xG and also boasted the biggest xGD (expected goals difference) from the opening weekend matches, at 1.9. Wolves don't sit bottom of the xG table however because at least they offered an attacking threat.",
      "Instead, it's Aston Villa, who drew 0-0 with Newcastle, who had the least to show - in a goalscoring sense - from the weekend. Newcastle's defensive performance, statistically in terms of xGA (expected goals against) was the best of the opening round.",
      "Spurs, 3-0 winners over Burnley, are second with an xG of 2.3, slightly ahead of Liverpool and newly-promoted Leeds United (2.1); Daniel Farke's men defeated Everton on Monday night thanks to Lukas Nmecha's controversial penalty.",
      "Despite failing to score in their loss to Arsenal at the weekend, United registered an xG of 1.5 with new signings Bryan Mbeumo (£71m) and Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) both having opportunities, while star striker Benjamin Sesko made his debut (£73.7m). Arsenal boasted an xG of 1.3 in their win, but the majority of that came via their winner, Riccardo Calafiori turning in on the goal-line after Altay Bayindir's error. It really is a case of take away that moment and that game, as a whole, looks completely different.",
      "The Red Devils return to Premier League action this weekend as they head to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham, where Ruben Amorim will hope their finishing is a little bit sharper. City are making the journey to London too, to face Tottenham. Arsenal host Leeds before Monday night's mouthwatering meeting between Newcastle and Liverpool at St James's Park.",

      "Former Manchester United star Eric Bailly has signed for La Liga side Real Oviedo. The move marks the third different club that the Ivory Coast international has joined since making his exit from Old Trafford in 2023.",
      "Bailly, 31, has signed a two-year deal with the newly promoted club, who earned their place in the top flight with the help of inspirational ex-Arsenal favourite Santi Cazorla. Bailly joins after his new side suffered an opening-day defeat to his former employers Villarreal.",
      "The central defender departed the Yellow Submarine when his deal with the club expired at the end of last season, after enjoying an 18-month return to the Estadi de la Ceramica. The 49-cap international featured just 12 times in La Liga for Villarreal last term and found himself among the substitutes more often than not ahead of his exit.",
      "The La Liga side offered him a home after seeing his move to Besiktas from Manchester United prove to be a failure. Bailly was released a year early from his contract at United to make the switch to Turkey on a free transfer.",
      "After eight appearances and a hamstring issue, Bailly found himself cast aside before the January transfer window even arrived and was banished after clashing with his own team-mate, Tayfur Bingol, during Besiktas' league clash at Antalyaspor. The centre-half was one of five players left out of first team plans before seeing his contract ripped up.",
      "Bailly revealed a curse had been placed upon him by an agent who claimed he was owed money following the player's move to Besiktas. The agent is said to have sent a message to Bailly during Besiktas’s 3-1 defeat to Fenerbahce, a game in which Bailly was penalised for handball and conceded a penalty.",
      "A message from the agent read: “I am happy to see what my curse is doing to you. You are not a man. You are a big Mickey Mouse.”",
      "But things at least now appear to be looking up for Bailly. The veteran has quickly felt welcomed by his new club and hopes to make a fast impact.",
      "“It hasn’t been difficult to come here,\" he said in his presentation. \"The most important thing for me is that they show interest in you, and I liked the project from the start. I’m really looking forward to getting started.",
      "\"I feel good. In a short time, there’s an important match, and I hope to be ready.\"",
      "\"I’m very excited about the team and its history,\" he added. \"They achieved something very important with the promotion, and I’m here to give my all.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has been dubbed \"sweetie\" by his new Barcelona team-mates following his summer loan switch from Manchester United. The England forward made the move to the Catalan giants after falling out of favour under Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim and spending the latter part of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "The 27-year-old has now lifted the lid on settling into life in Spain, revealing the amusing nickname his new colleagues have given him in an interview with Spanish publication SPORT. \"When they're having fun with each other, they call me 'sweetie',\" Rashford said.",
      "\"I don't know what it means, but it's funny when they talk to you like that [laughs]. Yeah, yeah, they know I'm trying to learn Spanish. I think it's important for me to learn as soon as possible. So it's stimulating. You're always learning, and that's good.\"",
      "When quizzed about whether he'd tried picking up any Catalan – the main language spoken in Barcelona's changing room – he said: \"Catalan is difficult. I suppose that while I'm here, I'll learn a little and hope it will help me understand more about Catalan culture, which I also want to do.\"",
      "Rashford made his competitive bow for Barca on Saturday against Mallorca. The striker came on for ex-Manchester City ace Ferran Torres during the second period as Hansi Flick's men secured a 3-0 win.",
      "\"Best way to start,\" Rashford wrote, before adding, \"Vamos equipo\" – which translates from Spanish into English as \"Let's go team\".",
      "Whilst speaking to Gary Lineker on The Rest Is Football podcast recently, Rashford was asked about settling into his new environment and how he's been keen to pick up the language.",
      "\"It's still Spanish, a lot of the lads speak Catalan, but the easy thing for me is that a lot of the lads understand English,\" he said. \"So I've just been picking up on the basics on the pitch, which I think I've done quite quickly.\"",
      "Rashford also revealed how his teammates have helped him adjust, particularly regarding the language barrier. He continued: \"There are good people who are like a bridge.",
      "\"Frenkie [de Jong] speaks really good English, Jules [Kounde] speaks very good English, but they also have good Spanish because they've been here a few years. But on the pitch, honestly it's easier than what I thought it would be.",
      "\"Also football overall, I know a lot of people say it, but it's a language in itself and it's easy to communicate through the general vibe on the pitch.\"",
      "Rashford also shared his enthusiasm about playing with some of Europe's top talents. \"It's so refreshing to be playing with them, every day they're full of energy and it keeps you having energy as well,\" he said.",
      "\"They're all really talented but the thing that surprised me is how mature they are on the pitch. They play the game at their own tempo, it's the way they've developed it's different.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand has called on Ruben Amorim to place his trust in Kobbie Mainoo despite his respect for Adam Wharton. Manchester United could strengthen their midfield before the transfer deadline and have been linked with Crystal Palace's Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Belaba this summer.",
      "It's understood that Wharton would cost at least £60m while Brighton are demanding more than £100m for Belaba. Nevertheless, according to Ferdinand, United also possess the solution in the form of Mainoo, who remained on the bench during Sunday's home loss to Arsenal.",
      "The ex-United defender is a massive admirer of Wharton but reckons the club can save cash by maximising the potential of Mainoo, who was utilised in various roles last season. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand said: \"He [Wharton] would have been one of the midfielders on my hitlist. Yes, we've been talking about Belaba; he's been the hot topic for the last month or so.",
      "\"Before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys. Listen, he's the nearest to a Michael Carrick type. He's a controller who plays forward from that deeper line position.",
      "\"I watched him against a couple of the bigger teams like Liverpool and Man City, and he was unfazed. He's ready for a big occasion and enjoys pressure. I love him, I think he's a fantastic footballer.",
      "\"But we've got Kobbie Mainoo. He can do that role, he can control a game and play deep. Playing two central midfielders, Kobbie Mainoo can play that role, given the opportunity. You can play through someone like him, you can get out of tight situations and open the game up.",
      "\"He might just have to be a patient young man at the moment, for the team to find its way, for the manager to then put the trust in him to go and play. If it was me, if I was playing two in the midfield, Kobbie Mainoo would be one of my two.",
      "\"I think he's a super talent who can handle the ball as well as anyone at Man United at present. I would give him that responsibility.\"",
      "After a stunning breakthrough 2023/24 season, when he shone for both United and England, Mainoo suffered an injury-hit campaign. Speaking earlier this year, Amorim revealed he would seek to establish a consistent role for Mainoo.",
      "The United boss explained: \"We are really happy to have more options and an option like Kobbie Mainoo, with the quality that he has - he has played as a 6, as an 8 and as a 10 - we are really pleased to have Kobbie Mainoo but we have to be careful, we need Kobbie Mainoo fit and fresh.",
      "\"In England, sometimes they play with three defenders also, was more or less the same position. So he can play, we need to help him and find a little bit like Casemiro, [who] is playing better because we understand better the way Casemiro can play.",
      "\"And I think we can do that with Kobbie because he has a lot of qualities. He is really good on the ball but also near the opponent's box. We will try to manage all that and find the right space for a player like Kobbie.\"",

      "Manchester United are still weighing up the possibility of signing a central midfielder in the remainder of the summer transfer window after moving on from Carlos Baleba.",
      "United have spent £200million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer and are now trying to offload unwanted players. They are trying to sell Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund to open up the possibility of more additions.",
      "While bolstering their attack was the priority for Ruben Amorim this summer, there are other areas that he would also like to strengthen. One of them is at the base of midfield, where Casemiro started in the opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United had asked Brighton about the possibility of signing Baleba, but have been put off by their £120m asking price. The 21-year-old Cameroon international is under contract with Brighton until June 2028 and Moises Caicedo’s £115m price tag in a sale to Chelsea two years ago has set a precedent on the south coast.",
      "Amorim hasn’t completely given up on signing a No.6 though, with The Athletic naming Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton as alternatives that are being considered. Having already spent over £200m, United have to think about whether making another major signing is viable with profit and sustainability rules to consider.",
      "Hjulmand is extremely well known to Amorim, who worked with the Sporting Lisbon captain during his time with the club. The 26-year-old is reportedly available for around £50m, two years after signing from Lecce for just £15m. He played 65 times under Amorim’s management at Sporting, winning two Primeira Liga titles and the Taca de Portugal.",
      "Wharton has caught the eye for Crystal Palace, but the club will be reluctant to sell, given Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze are already in talks to join Liverpool and Tottenham respectively. The 21-year-old has four years left on his contract with Palace and has admirers at other Premier League clubs.",
      "United have Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as options in holding midfield and, speaking ahead of the Arsenal game, Amorim insisted he didn’t need new players. “I'm really happy with our players,” he said when asked if they would sign a midfielder.",
      "\"They are working really well, we have different players for that position, so we are prepared to win any game with our players. Maybe Mason Mount is a player that I think can play in that position if we want something different. But then we are going to find out [during] the season. We have players to cope to win games in the Premier League.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler is very confident Baleba is staying, He said: \"He seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow. Very very very confident [he will stay], that's just my belief.\"",

      "The Premier League returned at the weekend – and with it so did the VAR controversy. Six teams picked up maximum points on the opening day, including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, who narrowly overcame Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "But it was the video assistant referee that has dominated the headlines once again, with a number of contentious decisions sparking debate online. Arguably the biggest talking point came during Chelsea's opener against Crystal Palace, which saw Eberechi Eze's free-kick ruled out for contravening one of the little-known rules of the game.",
      "Elsewhere, Everton's James Tarkowski was adjudged to have handled the ball in the box during their Monday Night Football clash against Leeds, much to the anger of manager David Moyes. VAR backed up referee Chris Kavanagh's decision before Lukas Nmecha converted from the spot on debut to hand his side a 1-0 win.",
      "Everton defender Tarkowski was penalised on Monday evening after a goal-bound shot from Leeds' Anton Stach appeared to hit his elbow in the box before thumping away for a corner. The referee pointed to the spot while the Toffees' skipper pleaded his innocence, and the on-field decision was confirmed by VAR.",
      "This error ended up costing Everton the match as they would lose 1-0, and manager Moyes fumed after the full-time whistle, stating: \"I think it's a really poor decision. VAR had a chance to undo it. They tried to say he was leaning to the ball. Surely you're allowed to lean with your hands by your sides!\"",
      "Neville's colleague, Jamie Carragher, agreed, adding: \"I think it is. I think he [Tarkowski] knows what he is doing. It is something I would do. Has he lost his bearings? It is a split-second decision. I think it is definitely a penalty.\"",
      "One of the most talked-about decisions saw Eze's stunning free-kick ruled out by VAR. Eze struck a venomous effort from outside the box that was too powerful for Robert Sanchez and appeared to have given Palace a shock lead at Stamford Bridge early in the first-half.",
      "However, the celebrations were quickly halted as the goal was checked. The goal was subsequently ruled out to the incredulity of the Palace fans, with one of their players deemed to have stood too close to the Chelsea wall.",
      "Referee Darren England announced to the crowd: \"After review, away number six [Marc Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.\"",
      "Guehi was deemed to have been encroaching on Chelsea's free-kick wall - Moises Caicedo in particular - as per law 13 of the International Football Association Board. This law states: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1m (1 yard) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\"",
      "The match between finished 0-0, and viewers were quick to jump on social media to share their disdain at the early decision. One wrote: \"Just to be clear, that Eze freekick shouldn't have been ruled out. I would have lost my mind if we had a goal chopped off for that.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we had scored a freekick like Eze’s today and it was ruled out for the same reason my head would be on mars,\" and a third added: \"Palace were well and truly robbed earlier that Eze freekick should've stood.\"",
      "However, despite the uproar, according to the laws of the game the correct decision was made by VAR.",
      "In the first game of the new campaign on Friday night, reigning champions Liverpool took on Bournemouth at Anfield. Early in the first half, Cherries defender Marcos Senesi appeared to have handled the ball near the halfway line, after initially attempting to control it with his thigh.",
      "Without this intervention, Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike looked to be away through on goal unchallenged, leading to a barrage of comments online criticising what seemed to be a huge miss from VAR.",
      "One wrote: \"PGMOL an absolute laughing stock just 13 minutes into the new Premier League season as a blatant handball and red card ignored by VAR, despite the whole world watching Bournemouth’s Senesi deliberately deny Ekitike and Liverpool a chance to score.\"",
      "Another said: \"That was a clear handball by Senesi,\" while a third noted: \"How did senesi not get booked for that handball tho?\"",
      "However, the decision was checked by VAR at the time, and the Premier League Match Centre X account cleared up the confusion for social media users via a tweet posted minutes after the incident. It read: \"The referee’s call of no red card to Senesi was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed not to be a clear handball offence nor denial of a goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO), due to the distance from goal.\"",
      "In the same game, the Cherries were denied a chance to equalise on the stroke of half-time with the scoreline still a 1-0. When a ball was floated into the box towards Senesi, he headed it back across the area into the path of an onrushing Alex Scott.",
      "However, Alexis Mac Allister challenged for the ball and the pair ended up in a heap on the ground, with Bournemouth fans screaming for a spot kick. It is unclear whether the alleged foul was checked by VAR, but supporters were up in arms about the moment on social media immediately.",
      "Alongside a clip of the incident, one wrote: \"Penalty against Liverpool in the first half? Didn’t get a replay or even a mention of it at half time…\" Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett also believed Bournemouth should have been awarded a penalty.",
      "He said: \"Bournemouth had a real strong shout for a penalty kick when Alexis Mac Allister came in and clattered Alex Scott. It was a careless challenge, and as such, it is a foul. This should have resulted in a penalty kick to Bournemouth.\"",
      "However, nothing was given and Liverpool went on to win the game 4-2, despite a spirited Bournemouth fightback.",
      "In Aston Villa's goalless draw with Newcastle, Ezri Konsa left his team with 10 men for a good majority of the second half due to his foul denying an \"obvious goal scoring opportunity\". In the 66th minute of the game, a ball was clipped into makeshift striker Anthony Gordon, who was through on goal.",
      "However, Konsa pulled the England international back just beyond the halfway line, and received a red card for his troubles by referee Craig Pawson - which was then checked by VAR and confirmed.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre updated viewers on the decision, as they wrote: \"The referee’s call of red card to Konsa for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",
      "Fans were less irritated by this decision, with many agreeing that the referee and his video assistant on the sidelines had made the correct decision. One wrote: \"Hard to argue against the earlier Aston Villa red card.\"",
      "But despite having a man advantage for the best part of half an hour at Villa Park, the Magpies failed to capitalise and the two sides played out a 0-0 draw.",
      "Some Manchester United fans felt hard done by after their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal following an incident involving William Salbia and Matheus Cunha right at the death. In the final minute of normal time, the ball was crossed into the Portuguese midfielder when Saliba appeared to go through the back of Matheus, with footage showing the Frenchman's left foot connecting with his opponent's.",
      "Cunha went down but United's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Simon Hooper who allowed play to continue, before VAR concluded that it did not warrant a penalty.",
      "Regardless, the decision wasn't given on the field or by VAR and Arsenal held on to secure all three points on the opening day of the season at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir did not take his opportunity at Arsenal. The Turkish goalkeeper started against the north Londoners at Old Trafford, after Andre Onana only recently recovering from a hamstring injury.",
      "United have been linked with a move for Italian shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma in recent weeks, but Bayindir had the perfect opportunity to prove he deserves to be Ruben Amorim's first choice goalkeeper. But was at fault for Arsenal's goal, as he allowed himself to be out-muscled by William Saliba, resulting in him getting a weak punch on Declan Rice's in-swinging corner, which Riccardo Calafiori headed in from close range.",
      "Amorim stuck up for the 27-year-old goalkeeper, stating the goal should have been disallowed as he felt Saliba had unfairly impeded him. After the result ended with the Gunners beating United 1-0, Ferdinand admitted he is unconvinced by the ex-Fenerbahce goalkeeper.",
      "Speaking on his show Rio Ferdinand Presents, the United legend said: \"What I would say is that it was a cheap goal. We gave you a goal. The keeper has got to be better. He’ll be hugely disappointed, because this was his chance.",
      "\"The manager has gone with him and backed him and he’s had, really, one thing to do in his penalty area and he didn’t pass the test. We say in the second half Raya had to come out under pressure from [Matthijs] De Ligt and he dealt with it.",
      "\"That’s the difference at the top level, one little mistake can cost you a game and the three points. He’s actually a nice guy, I’ve met him a good few times and spoke to him.",
      "\"He’s actually a hard-working guy, but in these situations it is so unforgiving. He’ll be judged hugely on this. That’s the way it is with goalkeepers. You make a mistake and it can be something that really is a little bit of your undoing at times.\"",
      "The goal was United's only mistake of the game, but it proved to be pivotal. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya was vital, making huge saves from Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while also commanding his penalty area.",
      "It proved to be the difference as the Gunners held onto their lead. However, after United's poor campaign last year, Ferdinand believes there is a lot to be optimistic about from their performance.",
      "He added: \"Outside of that mistake and that goal, I have everything to be positive about. There were so many positives compared to what I saw last season.",
      "\"You know United had 20 shots at goal against Arsenal? The last time United had 20 shots at goal against Arsenal was the 8-2 game (in 2011) at Old Trafford. That shows you.",
      "\"We didn’t score obviously, but I want chances. I prefer you to be creating chances and not scoring than actually not creating anything and looking a little bit limp up front.\"",

      "Manchester United have been given new hope of finding the funds for Gianluigi Donnarumma through returning Andre Onana to Inter Milan. The Italian side are interested in bringing the keeper back to the San Siro just two years after selling him to United, it has been claimed.",
      "Onana has had an up-and-down United career since reaching the Champions League final with Inter in 2023. He made a number of high-profile mistakes last season, though, prompting suggestions the Red Devils might look for an upgrade.",
      "The keeper has been absent from pre-season matches while working his way back to full fitness, but head coach Ruben Amorim insisted injury was not behind his decision to leave Onana out against Arsenal on Sunday. \"No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that,\" Amorim said after picking Altay Bayindir and naming Tom Heaton on the bench.",
      "United have been linked with a number of keepers as his replacement. The bulk of the noise concerns Gianluigi Donnarumma, who two former stars believe would be the right man for the job, while there has also been renewed interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez.",
      "Senne Lammens is also a target, with United and Inter both after the Belgian. However, according to The Sun, Inter are turning their attentions to Onana amid a feeling he would welcome a return to the club,",
      "If Inter do come in with a bid for Onana, it could well allow United to land Donnarumma despite interest from neighbours Manchester City. The Italian won the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain last season but is thought to be available for as little at £26million after the French club's summer move for Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Such a move would please former United star Wayne Rooney. \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him,\" the former striker said on his podcast. \"I don't think he's a risk. I saw a stat the other day - the errors leading direct to goals. His was zero,\"",
      "Rooney isn't the only former United player insistent on an upgrade in goal. “It’s a glaring issue at United that cannot be ignored and that is that they do need to find a goalkeeper. They have to, I’m absolutely unequivocal on that,\" former skipper Gary Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"In my 20 years at Man United we had two periods of seven or eight years with [Peter] Schmeichel and [Edwin] Van der Sar and in between we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it’s really unsettling when you don’t have a dominant No.1 who is 6ft 2in, dominant in the air and owns his six-yard box and comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves one-on-one and saves you points when your defenders make mistakes.\"",

      "Napoli have been forced to reconsider a move for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund in the summer transfer window after Romelu Lukaku suffered an injury.",
      "Lukaku is Antonio Conte’s main option at centre-forward, but he will be unavailable for around three months after picking up a thigh injury. The Belgian striker went off injured in a pre-season friendly against Olympiakos last week and Napoli have now confirmed the extent of the problem.",
      "The defending Serie A champions could be without Lukaku until November and have therefore turned to the transfer market. Hojlund was considered earlier in the summer before Conte opted instead to sign Lorenzo Lucca from Udinese on a loan deal with an obligation to buy.",
      "The Dane is poised to leave Old Trafford this summer after Ruben Amorim left him out of the squad for their opening game of the season against Arsenal on Sunday. The arrival of Benjamin Sesko in a £74m deal from RB Leipzig has relegated Hojlund down the pecking order and United are ready to sanction his exit.",
      "Having signed him for £72m from Atalanta two years ago, they are now ready to sell for under half of that price. Hojlund has a good reputation in Italy thanks to his spell with Atalanta and AC Milan are also considering a move.",
      "However, Milan are understood to prefer Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic, who is also on the shortlist at Napoli, along with Lecce's Nikola Krstovic, Monaco's Breel Embolo and Sassuolo's Andrea Pinamonti.",
      "Meanwhile, Hojlund could also be in competition with his United team-mate, with Corriere dello Sport saying that Joshua Zirkzee is another option for Napoli with Crystal Palace ’s Jean-Philippe Mateta and Roma’s Artem Dovbyk.",
      "Hojlund is under contract with United until June 2028, while the club also holds the option to extend his stay by a further year. He struggled to make an impact last season, scoring just 10 goals in 52 matches and Amorim is ready to move on, with his record of 26 strikes in 95 games altogether not convincing.",
      "There are less than two weeks remaining in the transfer window, but Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed their interest. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” he said. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.”",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho to Roma and Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, but have been frustrated by the difficulty in doing so. They have only succeeded in sending Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona and need more exits before they can move for a midfielder or goalkeeper.",

Liverpool icon Carragher plumped for Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner - the Austrian having led the Eagles to the FA Cup and Community Shield in 2025.",
      "Neville had a different idea though and selected Manchester United boss Amorim. Seeing that prediction, Carragher burst into fits of laughter, which did not go down too well with Neville.",
      "He said: “Why you laughing?” to which Carragher replied: “You pick the Man United manager every year on that.”",
      "“I don’t pick them every year, it’s disrespectful,” Neville then said before Carragher pointed out: “You picked three of the last year and one of them was Ten Hag.”",
      "Explaining his thought process, the United icon said: “The reason last year was a similar reason to this. Ten Hag last year because I knew if he started badly, he’d be under massive pressure. Similarly, there’s probably going to be no in between here.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, if he starts off badly and they’re in 13th, 14th in October, November, he’s going to be under massive pressure. He’s the Manchester United manager, he has to deliver in these first few months of the season and I think he will outperform.",
      "“I know you’re not sure about him and you sort of wrote your article the other day saying that you think he’s not that good. Well, what was your article about?”",

      "The Manchester United squad is in broad agreement with Alan Shearer following the positive opening weekend display against Arsenal. One of the best displays in recent memory from United went unrewarded as an Altay Bayindir error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to head the Gunners in front early on, with United unable to convert any of their 22 attempts at goal in 1-0 loss.",
      "Although they suffered defeat, many United fans left Old Trafford feeling upbeat about the impact of new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in a revitalised attack that kept Mikel Arteta’s side pegged back for long stretches. Following the game, the feeling within the squad was one of encouragement.",
      "That feeling was shared by Premier League legend Shearer, who hasn’t been afraid to stick the boot in on both United and Ruben Amorim in recent times. But speaking on the Rest is Football with Gary Lineker and Miach Richards, the Newcastle icon said: “I think for me the two standouts [were Cunha and Mbeumo].",
      "“Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "“I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.”",
      "Amorim also brought up United’s improved intensity levels as he hailed the performance, saying: “It’s more about the intensity our players play at, if they are brave, if they are talented, if they are powerful. We show a little bit more than that.",
      "“We have a lot to do and have to focus on the next one. I think also, they understand better the way we have to do it.",
      "“They are prepared to do it physically and they want to help each other. That is a very good feeling. Sometimes, you can see one guy missing one run or one pass and you feel the team is all together.”",
      "However, Shearer cautioned that United must sign a new keeper if they are to make genuine strides this season, with question marks over error-prone pair Bayindir and Andre Onana. United have been linked with PSG stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Shearer said: “I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",

      "Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher have issued their thoughts on the 2025-26 Premier League season - and have once again failed to see eye-to-eye. The new campaign got underway over the weekend, with title holders Liverpool getting off to a perfect start.",
      "Contenders Arsenal and Manchester City also secured three points on the opening day. But Chelsea stumbled against Crystal Palace despite their huge summer spend.",
      "And those results appear to have changed the minds of both Carragher and Neville, who have issued their predictions over what will happen over the next 10 months. Giving his verdict, the Man United icon has predicted Arsenal to win the league - but only just.",
      "He said: “I couldn't separate Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool. I think they're absolutely all in with an equal chance of winning it. Arsenal have been consistent over the last three years, they've been second. I do feel they'll get there at some point.",
      "“Liverpool, the two full-backs have got to settle in. They look a little bit open. They are going to be exhilarating to watch. They're going to score a lot of goals.",
      "“City have an unbelievable spine. I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.”",
      "Carragher disagrees, however, and has picked Liverpool to make it back-to-back titles. He replied: “What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit.",

      "“But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season. I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.”",
      "Away from the title, there is also disparity on the Champions League qualifiers. Carragher sees Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea finishing in the top four, while Neville has predicted the Red Devils to join their cross-city rivals and Liverpool.",
      "Carragher has cheekily plumped for Man United as surprise European contenders, with Neville selecting Nottingham Forest. At the other end of the table, both agree that Wolves and Burnley will slip into the Championship, albeit Carragher believes Sunderland will be relegated, with Neville suggesting Leeds will be condemned to an instant return to the second tier.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed that Sol Campbell refused to speak to him for over six months - ignoring him on England duty - as the Arsenal star felt the Manchester United icon dived for an infamous penalty.",
      "In October 2004 the Red Devils ended the Gunners' lengthy unbeaten run, which stood at 49 games. A 2-0 win at Old Trafford left a sour taste for those associated with Arsenal, none more so than Campbell, who gave away the penalty for the opening goal.",
      "It was immediately evident that Campbell was stunned by the decision and felt Rooney simulated to get his team the spot kick. When the two were expected to put differences aside on international duty the centre-half refused to do so.",
      "The Arsenal defender didn't want to engage with Rooney as the bad blood went on for months, leading to some moments of silence when the pair were with the Three Lions. The former United man though insists there was contact and he didn't dive.",
      "He said on The Wayne Rooney Show: \"It was a big game for Arsenal. If they had won it, it was 50 games unbeaten for them. We beat them 2-0 and Campbell did not speak to me for over six months. We met up [during international duty] and Sol won't speak to me. Sometimes, I was with Sol and I'd say to him: 'Come on man, we are playing for England here'. But he wouldn't speak to me because he felt I dived. He left his leg out and I think there was a small contact.\"",
      "Campbell certainly held onto the incident and when he acknowledged Rooney's brilliance in 2017 - some 13 years after the incident - he still accused him of diving. \"What a career Wayne Rooney. A fantastic servant for England. Only one dive that annoyed me against Man Utd 49th game.\"",
      "Theirry Henry is another Arsenal icon to come out over the years and call out Rooney for his dive, which ended his side's historic run. He refused to entertain any theory other than the United legend conning the ref.",
      "He said: \"I think they were superior on the day, but it was still 0-0 and we would take a 0-0. But Rooney dived. I don't care however people say whatever, he did dive and that's how they got the penalty. When you see the replay you clearly see Sol Campbell doesn't extend his leg, he pulls it back, and Rooney was clever to get that penalty.\"",
      "Campbell would play for England for another three years after his incident with Rooney before eventually retiring in 2007. Neither Arsenal nor United would claim the title the year the Invincible's had their run ended with Chelsea claiming the title and the Gunners winning the battle for second.",

Rashford has left behind his boyhood club to join Barca on loan for the 2025-26 season, but couldn’t help giving his take on the rebuilding job Amorim has on his hands at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford had some damning criticism for United, claiming they can’t hide behind the excuse of being a club in transition. “To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it,” he said last week on The Rest is Football Podcast.",
      "“This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",
      "“All eyes are on him. Can he do it? He had a horrible start to his United career. He didn’t want the job part way through last season.”",
      "Presenter David Jones interjected: “Do you not think because of that he gets this season, whatever happens?”",
      "“Oh no I don’t think it’ll be that easy,” responded Neville. “I think if he’s down in the bottom half of the table he’ll be under massive pressure.”",
      "Again Jones interjected, this time asking: “What about what Marcus Rashford said the other day, that Manchester United have got to come up with a plan and stick with it somewhere, haven’t they?”",
      "Neville held up his hand, waved it, and, somewhat damningly remarked: “Let’s ignore that, because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Continuing more broadly on Amorim’s United, and what he’d seen from their opening game of the season – the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal on Sunday – Neville offered: “Yesterday was the first time I watched that formation out on Old Trafford, where I thought ‘right, we’ve got a chance here, that worked'.",
      "“He’d got a few different players in, he’d got [Mason] Mount back, got Luke Shaw in at left centre-back, that helped and I think it was the first time, it’s a difficult, rare system, it needs specialists, but when you saw [Matheus] Cunha play, saw Mount play, saw Shaw at left centre-back - there was a balance! Casemiro looked a better player all of a sudden! Just straight away he looked a better player.”",
      "Laughing, Jamie Carragher interrupted: “It was one game!” United continue their Premier League campaign against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",

      "If there was a literal market for clubs to sell their players, the Manchester United stall would struggle for footfall.",
      "United have still not sold a player this summer. They trumpeted the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford, his salary covered entirely by Barcelona, as it would save them around £14million over a 12-month period.",
      "Rashford's transfer came surprisingly early in late July as Nico Williams had signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool rejected Barca's offer for Luis Diaz. Rashford was Plan C.",
      "Incomings have taken precedence at United and they have invested more than £200m in a new front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, signed in time for the pre-season tour, impressed on debut against Arsenal. Cunha was voted the club's man of the match.",
      "United now have a bloated ten forwards on their books and want to jettison four of them before the September 1 transfer deadline. Rasmus Hojlund, omitted from the squad against Arsenal, may as well join the bomb squad of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia to make up a five-a-side team.",
      "United have sold poorly for several years, stretching back to Sir Alex Ferguson's time. Last year's sales topped hit £109.18m and appeared to signal a corner turned. Instead, United are being backed into a corner by clubs prepared to chance their arm.",
      "The salary structure that United are intent on reining in is one issue. Casemiro will see out an excessive four-year contract primarily due to the high wages of £350,000-a-week that United offered him in 2022. United have instructed four different intermediaries to try and sell Casemiro, to no avail.",
      "It is the same issue with Jadon Sancho, who joined the club a year before Casemiro. Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold each signed off those deals at curious times in their tenures. Woodward had already tendered his resignation after his role in the aborted Super League breakaway and had form for appeasement buys dating back to the club-record addition of Juan Mata in January 2014.",
      "Arnold was into his first summer as chief executive and had travelled to Barcelona to try and force through a deal for Frenkie de Jong. United lost their first two games of the season, the second at Brentford a generational nadir, and the panic-buy button was hit. Casemiro and Antony came in.",
      "Sancho is a particularly unique case. Chelsea paid £5m not to buy him after a subdued season-long loan. He has not played in the Premier League for United in nearly two years and he was effectively banished from the squad for a year.",
      "He took periods of leave in each of his first two seasons at United, too. The second for a lengthy three months, albeit one that coincided with the 2022 World Cup.",
      "There has been so much written and said about Sancho that some clubs flagged to United pieces where they felt the club had briefed against the player, effectively accusing United of penning hatchet jobs about Sancho.",
      "If that is deniable, what is undeniable is that the United co-owner effectively lamented the Sancho deal. Sir Jim Ratcliffe named Sancho, Casemiro, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana as players United had \"inherited\" or \"overpaid\" for in March. In an ideal world, United would have sold the quintet this summer.",
      "Industry sources believe Amorim's bullish approach has cost United money. Hojlund is the latest player to be cut loose after publicly addressing his position in the team and there was no route back for Rashford after he arranged an interview to state he was \"ready for a new challenge\". Garnacho burned his bridges by questioning his demotion for the Europa League final.",
      "Hojlund has been cast aside since he outlined his intention to stay minutes after Amorim refused to say if he would in the wake of the Dane's two-goal performance against Bournemouth in Chicago. Hojlund's resale value is harmed more by his form than his vocalizing but Chelsea are waiting it out with Garnacho to drive down the price.",
      "Some of it is beyond United's control. Tyrell Malacia, a frugal buy on the strength of how he performed against Ajax for Feyenoord, did not play a club game for 550 days due to knee problems and was substituted in four of his five starts under Amorim.",
      "The 26-year-old started five times on loan at PSV Eindhoven and is out of contract next year. There is little incentive to part with cash for a left back who has started ten games in two years and was overestimated by Erik ten Hag.",
      "Antony would have been sold had United not paid nearly double the amount Ajax were initially seeking for him in 2022. The winger excelled in La Liga and is back in the Brazil squad but United require £32.58m to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Realistically, no suitable and interested club will be coughing that up so a compromise is required.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the stall for Garnacho after three clubs passed on him, having conducted due diligence. Garnacho is Premier League-proven and Chelsea had no pre-season schedule following their Club World Cup commitments, so there was never an urgent need to push through a move.",
      "They are not going to have their feet suddenly trampled on at the stall.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Manchester United have spent more than £200million for the third summer out of the last four but are unlikely to be done there.",
      "There are clearly two areas of the squad that could, or should, be reinforced before the 7pm deadline on September 1 but, as is often the case with United in August, the priority has to be outgoings.",
      "United have at least five players they want to jettison yet they have still not outright sold a member of their first team squad this summer. Marcus Rashford, the most high-profile departure, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "There are at least seven deals for United to negotiate over the next 13 days:",
      "Sign a midfielder",
      "As good as Carlos Baleba might be, United making a beeline for him a few years after they rued passing on Moises Caicedo seemed rather narrow-minded. Brighton polish gems better than most clubs yet value them much more than diamonds. United do not have the headroom for a record midfield signing.",
      "But they do need a midfielder and need to get creative. Manuel Ugarte, a dubious choice to bolster the midfield last year, is still playing second fiddle to the ageing Casemiro and it feels like United have all but given up on a player Ruben Amorim coached at Sporting.",
      "Joao Palhinha would have been a smart move by United but the word is they want permanent additions and he joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. With deadline day less than a fortnight away, United may have to compromise on that stance.",
      "Sign a goalkeeper",
      "United have been on the lookout for a 'keeper for the entire calendar year, though sources stressed a new No.1 was not a priority. There are figures at the club prepared to give Andre Onana the benefit of the doubt and Amorim likes the Cameroonian.",
      "A bigger problem than Onana is what is behind him. Altay Bayindir is not Premier League quality and demonstrated that again against Arsenal, having got away with one on the final day of last season when he spilt the ball into Morgan Rogers' path. Bayindir was bailed out by a worse error by the referee.",
      "Amorim's reaction to the mention of Tom Heaton was akin to Hogwarts pupils' horror at the mention of Lord Voldemort. That would suggest Heaton may not get a kick for the third season running at United.",
      "Amorim claimed on Sunday he is \"happy\" with the goalkeeping options. It was delivered with all the diplomacy of a scheming politician.",
      "Sell Garnacho",
      "With the exception of Rashford, the bomb squad members have predictably remained in situ into the last fortnight of the window. Clubs are prepared to wait it out and force their value down, none more so brazenly than Chelsea with Garnacho.",
      "United sources feel that Chelsea's interest in January was part of the long game. A long game that Garnacho's representatives, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, participated in when they visited Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea are the only bidders at the table after Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Atletico Madrid passed on Garnacho. The 21-year-old's publicly puerile behaviour mounts more pressure on United to sell him.",
      "United are determined not to undervalue a player whose valuation was listed at €97.4m by the CIES Football Observatory 12 months ago. But the closer we get to the deadline the more Garnacho's value diminishes.",
      "Sell Sancho",
      "Jadon Sancho is out of contract at United in ten months and is such a tough sell Chelsea paid £5m not to sign him. He has sought refuge in Italy, a sanctuary for Premier League rejects. Yet Sancho is refusing to take a salary cut, as if he is worth the £250,000-a-week United remunerated him with four years ago.",
      "If United cannot get a fee for Sancho then they would have to consider paying him off just to get him out of the building. Amusingly, a player who was banished from the first team dressing room at Carrington and has not played a competitive match for United in two years has his own space in the new changing area at the training complex. It is in United's interests to have Sancho's name taken down.",
      "Sell Malacia",
      "Talking of tough sells: Malacia did not play a club game for 550 days, was substituted at half-time in four of his five starts last term, was loaned to the Eredivisie and PSV Eindhoven did not want to make his loan a permanent deal.",
      "Malacia, billed as a \"youngster\" by club media last year, is now 26 and his deal expires next year. United only require a few million quid to avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules yet even the cheapest addition of the Erik ten Hag era is tough to shift. You could count the number of good games Malacia had for United on one hand.",
      "Sell Antony",
      "Antony excelled in La Liga and regained his place in the Brazil squad. In different circumstances, there would be a market for him.",
      "There is not one because United yielded to Ten Hag's demands and agreed a €100m deal with Ajax for Antony three years ago. United require around £32.5m not to make a loss on Antony, under contract until 2027. Few clubs could afford that and part with it.",
      "Antony has season-long loan with obligation to buy (minus a Sancho-style loophole) written all over him.",
      "Sell Hojlund",
      "For such a candid coach, it was mystifying that Amorim skirted the issue of Rasmus Hojlund's squad omission against Arsenal. It was established months ago that United had planned to sell Hojlund and he is not the first to be bombed out by Amorim after speaking publicly about his position in the team.",
      "Italy always seemed a likely exit route after Inter Milan touched base in the summer. Hojlund could return to northern Italy but to AC. United are so prepared to cut their losses they would accept £30m.",

      "\"Andre recovered.\" The words of Ruben Amorim on Friday. Onana stayed in his purple Manchester United hoodie and tracksuit bottoms at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Onana had three team training sessions before the Arsenal fixture, an insufficient number in Amorim's eyes. So Altay Bayindir kept goal, Tom Heaton was on the bench and Dermot Mee assisted with the warm-up.",
      "Bayindir blundered, United lost and Amorim seethed at the suggestion that Heaton, 40 in April and without any playing time since February 2023, should have started ahead of him.",
      "The post-match questioning centred so heavily on the goalkeeper that it was the quickest an Amorim press conference had been wrapped up. United had performed admirably but lost because of his choice of goalkeeper. Questions on that topic were inevitable.",
      "Whenever Onana does not play, United cannot have him back between the sticks quickly enough. Bayindir did not cover himself in glory at Newcastle United in April when Onana was taken out of the firing line in the wake of his lapses in Lyon.",
      "After persistent questioning from a colleague, Amorim assured journalists he was \"happy\" with the United goalkeeper department. He can't be. Onana has had two error-strewn seasons and Bayindir is inadequate back-up.",
      "This correspondent reported in May that a goalkeeper was not considered a priority by United and they have not wavered. They have been on the lookout for one, serious enough to chance their arm with a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa.",
      "Midway through last season, United considered goalies to come in but not as outright number ones. A competitive understudy to Onana would be the smart move.",
      "Goalkeepers are protective of each other and Onana rates Bayindir. He is in the minority. Bayindir has conceded 21 goals in 12 United appearances. The three matches that they conceded four goals in last season - away at Tottenham, Newcastle and Brentford - came with Bayindir in goal.",
      "The standard of United's first and second-choice goalies is so low there is not an argument to rotate them. It is not even akin to Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in 2004-05, never mind David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard for the first half of the 2011-12 campaign or De Gea and Dean Henderson in 2020-21. If Onana is remotely fit, he should always start.",
      "Erik ten Hag knew it and he was the manager when Bayindir signed. He did just about anything he could to not play him, delaying Onana's release for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024. Bayindir's only outings under Ten Hag were against League Two Newport County and League One Barnsley in domestic cup ties.",
      "Bayindir's international situation has partly caused United to preserve the status quo. He is always picked for Turkey squads to play second fiddle, so there is not the incentive for Bayindir to get on the move and guarantee a call-up for the World Cup next year.",
      "Arguably the best 'keeper in the world is on the market now. Paris Saint-Germain want to cash in on Gianluigi Donnarumma but United are not expected to come calling for a goalie reputedly demanding £400,000-a-week. If Donnarumma ends up in Manchester, it is likely to be at City.",
      "Onana expects to stay with United more intent on recruiting a midfielder than a goalkeeper before the September 1 deadline. His hamstring injury has had an undeniable influence on the dormant state of the club's goalkeeping department.",
      "United have promising goalies on loan in the Championship and League Two. Radek Vitek, a teammate of Kobbie Mainoo's and Alejandro Garnacho's in the FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2022, has kept two clean sheets in two games for Bristol City in the second tier.",
      "The unspoken rule at United is academy players loaned to the Championship have a decent chance of returning to the first team squad. With Heaton in his 40th year and Bayindir and Onana highly unlikely to start a fourth successive season as No.1 and No.2, Vitek is auspiciously placed for a promotion if he continues his solid start at Ashton Gate.",
      "Elyh Harrison is lower down the pyramid at Shrewsbury Town and could be lower come the campaign's conclusion. They have lost their first two matches and are one of the favourites to drop into the National League. Dean Henderson enhanced his reputation on loan at Shrewsbury in 2017-18, back when they were attempting to break into the Championship.",
      "It has been three-and-a-half years since Henderson last played for United and no good can come from dwelling on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's mismanagement of him. United are improving their development of club-trained 'keepers, so much so that Matej Kovar fetched a respectable fee of £7.7million from Bayer Leverkusen in 2023. The Czech Republic number one absconded to PSV Eindhoven last month after Ten Hag, who sanctioned his sale by United, arrived at the BayArena.",
      "Ten Hag resisted a reunion with Onana. His new goalkeeper, Mark Flekken, is Dutch and shares the same agent.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on the appointment of Brentford academy director Stephen Torpey.",
      "In June, it was confirmed that Cox was to leave the academy after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022.",
      "Torpey was appointed as Brentford's academy director in January 2024. Brentford hired him to essentially build their academy from scratch and deliver Category One academy status, but he is a candidate who could potentially relocate to Manchester after spending just a year-and-a-half in London.",
      "Torpey was previously at Manchester City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years in different positions, notably working closely alongside Jason Wilcox, director of football at United.",
      "Torpey joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups in 2020, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",
      "The 43-year-old is credited with helping City implement a Barcelona-style coaching system, which has subsequently enabled the club's youth teams to win trophies with a similar style of football to their first-team.",
      "Torpey played a role in the development of Cole Palmer, James McAtee and Rico Lewis, who all progressed through the academy system at City to make senior debuts under Pep Guardiola. He also played a role in player recruitment as part of a team of academy staff who pitched to potential new signings.",
      "After a modest playing career which began as a youngster at Liverpool, Torpey explored a career in coaching and returned to Anfield. He was welcomed back to Merseyside as a Liverpool academy graduate, and worked in the youth system while it underwent a period of change, guided by the Spanish influence of Rafael Benitez.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Tuesday, August 19.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League campaign with a narrow 1–0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were named in the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko made his debut off the bench. However, it was Riccardo Calafiori who scored the decisive goal, handing Arsenal all three points.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer market, with United continuing their search for reinforcements to bolster Ruben Amorim’s squad. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is a player the head coach is understood to admire, and he’s now firmly on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton follows reports that a move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the transfer deadline. United are said to be relaxed about the situation and open to revisiting the deal next year.",
      "Meanwhile, outgoings remain a key focus. Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Højlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to leave the club before the window closes.",
      "Manchester United are closing in on the appointment of Brentford academy director Stephen Torpey.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Napoli could reportedly sign Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United as Romelu Lukaku faces months out with an injury.",
      "The former United striker sustained a torn quad muscle during their final pre-season friendly before the Serie A season starts. Napoli have said Lukaku will undergo a surgical consultation after beginning his rehabilitation programme.",
      "Lorenzo Lucca signed earlier this summer and will deputise for the Belgium international, but is now their only recognised centre-forward after they loaned Giovanni Simeone to Torino and Galatasaray re-signed Victor Osimhen. Antonio Conte is said to therefore want another option who will aid their title defence this season.",
      "The Guardian reports that Napoli are considering moving for Hojlund after monitoring the Denmark international. The report claims Conte is an admirer of Hojlund's; however, his club would reportedly favour a loan deal instead of the permanent move United would prefer.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho has not accepted a proposal from Roma, according to transfer insider Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United were prepared to accept I Giallorossi's £20million offer as they look to sell Sancho before the end of the summer.",
      "However, Sancho has not agreed personal terms with Roma and there is concern that he might chose to move elsewhere.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has failed to convince the club's board to buy Aston Villa a goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, according to reports in Argentina.",
      "Altay Bayindir filled in for Andre Onana during United's Premier League opener and was at fault for Arsenal's winner.",
      "Amorim is thought to have been pushing for a new 'keeper with Martinez at the top of his shortlist, but journalist Gaston Edul claim the United boss has been unable to get the United hierarchy to spend big on a new No.1.",
      "Manchester United are fearful that meeting Sporting CP's demands for Morten Hjulmand before the end of the window might impact their plans to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton next summer, according to GIVEMESPORT.",
      "Influential figures behind-the-scenes are hestitating about whether they should enter negotiations with Sporting or focus on alternative targets.",
      "Hjulmand has a release clause in the region of £69million inserted into his contract. While United could trigger that and sign the Denmark international, they do not want to eat into their budget for next year.",
      "United are therefore aware that spending big to land Hjulmand may harm their bid to land Baleba in 12 months time.",
      "Fulham are the latest club to emerge as an interested suitor in Rasmus Hojlund but it looks unlikely he will make the switch.",
      "That is because Rodrigo Muniz joining Atalanta is now off the table with the Serie A side turning their attention onto Lecce's Nikola Krstović after their £34.6million offer was not accepted by Fulham.",
      "Hojlund was being eyed as a potential replacement for Muniz, as per the Mirror, but it looks as though Marco Silva will not need one now.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho joining Chelsea from Manchester United appears to be getting closer judging by the latest update on X from transfer guru Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Chelsea are advancing in club to club talks for Alejandro Garnacho! Deal underway with Man United.",
      "Excellent relationship between United CEO Berrada and Chelsea hierarchy. Garnacho only wants #CFC and turned down an approach from Bayern in last 48h; no chance.",
      "AS Roma have not yet left the race for Jadon Sancho despite the Manchester United star not accepting their initial proposal.",
      "Besiktas have also registered an interest but a move to Turkiye also looks unlikely. Though Sancho is considering alternative options with Roma also looking elsewhere for new signings, the two could yet come back together.",
      "According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Roma have not given up just yet with new signing Leon Bailey set to try and convince him to join.",
      "It looks as though Manchester United are still planning to sign a central midfielder despite failing in their bid to sign Carlo Baleba.",
      "According to the Athletic, United will be weighing up whether or not they can spend more money at a time when raising funds is a priority.",
      "The report added that Morten Hjulmand, who worked with Ruben Amorim at Sporting, is a midfielder appreciated by those at Old Trafford.",
      "Having accepted they did not have the funds to sign Carlos Baleba, it looks as though Manchester United have identified a much cheaper alternative.",
      "According to Orgullobiri Sevilla, via Sport Witness, United are going for Lucien Agoume. He has a £35million release clause in his Sevilla contract and while the La Liga side are willing to accept a lower offer, they will not let him leave for less than £26million.",
      "The report has stated that 'Manchester United are coming' but it is also stated that other unnamed Premier League clubs are interested.",
      "\"Course we have,\" Neville replied, causing Carragher and Jones to burst into laughter. \"I can't disappoint you. I've got to come back here in 10 months and try to defend this. So, David, we've worked out before that I've done this now for eight years and I've always had Manchester United in the top four, every year.\"",
      "In addition to United, Neville predicted Liverpool and City to finish in the top four, while Carragher backed Arne Slot's side to lift the trophy for a second successive season. He also predicted City, Arsenal, and Chelsea to finish in the top four.",
      "Besiktas are showing interest in Jadon Sancho.",
      "According to Sporx, Besiktas have renewed their interest in the 25-year-old following their failed attempts to sign Wolves' Goncalo Guedes. Despite interest from Juventus, Besiktas are said to be staying patient in their pursuit of the United forward.",
      "With most European transfer windows closing on September 1, the Black Eagles believe they may still have a chance to sign the Englishman afterwards. Super Lig clubs have an extra 12 days to complete deals next month, and the plan is to wait until competition has eased.",
      "The MEN reported in May that a goalkeeper was not considered a priority by Man United and they have not wavered.",

      "Read more here.",
      "United have reportedly advised Sancho to find a solution to his future 'as soon as possible.'",
      "The winger rejected a proposal from AS Roma after personal terms could not be agreed between the two parties. Sancho has just under two weeks to seal a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "As it stands, it's said that Sancho's plan will be to 'consider different proposals' in the coming days.",
      "Manchester United have spent more than £200million for the third summer out of the last four but are unlikely to be done there.",
      "There are clearly two areas of the squad that could, or should, be reinforced before the 7pm deadline on September 1 but, as is often the case with United in August, the priority has to be outgoings.",
      "United have at least five players they want to jettison yet they have still not outright sold a member of their first team squad this summer. Marcus Rashford, the most high-profile departure, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan.",
      "There are at least seven deals for United to negotiate over the next 13 days.",
      "Read more, here.",
      "Time is running out for Man United to sanction a permanent transfer for Garnacho.",
      "The Athletic report that Chelsea have shown interest, with the Argentine remaining a priority target to provide competition for Jamie Gittens on the left wing. Meanwhile, Garnacho has ruled out all options other than a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "The two clubs are reportedly in active talks to try to find a solution.",
      "Manchester United consider Zirkzee not for sale this summer, as Rasmus Hojlund is expected to leave.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says the decision was made by both the board and Amorim 'months ago.'",
      "The 24-year-old was an unused substitute in the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their opening game of the season.",
      "While Manchester United would prefer a permanent move for the left-back, The Athletic reports that a loan cannot be 'ruled out.'",
      "They also note that the 26-year-old has attracted interest from FC Porto, while AS Roma have 'registered an interest' in Malacia.",
      "Italian outlet Sport Italia understand that negotiations between Milan and Man United for Hojlund are 'already underway' and could 'accelerate' in the coming days.",
      "Sporting director Igli Tare confirmed their interest this week. He said: \"Hojlund is a good option for us. We are evaluating it these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.",
      "\"We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they have to be players who can give something more to this group.\"",
      "Ferdinand has called on Man United to look at Wharton.",
      "\"We’ve been talking about Baleba, he’s been the hot topic for the last month or so, but before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys I was saying,\" he said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"He’s the nearest to a Michael Carrick type, who’s a controller, who can play, who plays forward from that deeper line position at times. He can be an eight if you need him to be and can run on at times if need be, but he’s more of a conductor and can control things.",
      "\"I watched him in a couple of games last season against big teams like Man City and Liverpool, and he looks unfazed. He looks ready for a big occasion. He enjoys pressure, can play under pressure, and the game kind of slows down when the ball is around him. I love him. I think he’s a fantastic footballer.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly set for internal discussions over whether to move for another No. 6 before the September 1 deadline.",
      "The club have opted to wait at least another year before making a push for Carlos Baleba, though The Athletic note there is strong admiration for Morten Hjulmand, who previously worked under Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP.",
      "Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton is also under consideration, but any move would need to be balanced against United’s priority of raising funds through player sales.",
      "While Baleba was seen as a 'special opportunity,' the pursuit of a new midfielder is described as 'not guaranteed.'",
      "De Gea has sensationally been linked with a return transfer to Man United two years after leaving the club.",
      "United are reportedly making 'checks' into the Spaniard of whom it is said can leave Fiorentina for a small amount. That has supposedly alerted Old Trafford chiefs, who could seek to spring a reunion amid troubles in the goalkeeping department.",
      "It has not been a priority position to strengthen for United, but now they are being linked with this stunning change of goalkeepers if De Gea were to return.",
      "\"Let’s see, hopefully they can win something and be there where they deserve.\"",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba has been linked with a move but he could prove to be expensive, given Brighton's history of being tough negotiators in the past across many examples of their transfer dealings.",
      "As such, alternatives may be explored and United could do a lot worse than looking in the direction of Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller. The 24-year-old is a Germany international who helped his side win the DFB Pokal last season. His energy and calmness on the ball has been praised in the German media.",
      "Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger, who has played with Stiller at international level, said: \"I must say I am a bit of a fan of Angelo Stiller and I played against him in the Champions League. I was impressed by his calmness on the ball. He was rarely nervous and has a big future ahead of him if he stays fit.\"",
      "A £34million price tag has been suggested this summer and if that is to be the case, United could well land themselves a bargain if they choose to re-route their midfield search.",
      "The Telegraph claim Chelsea will finalise the signing of the winger once two other transfers are completed.",
      "Chelsea believe they can secure Garnacho for a bargain if they wait longer before making their move ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, United are firm on getting a fair price for the academy graduate, valuing him higher than the £30million currently offered by their rivals.",
      "The Blues intend to step up their pursuit of Garnacho and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons once they complete the sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson.",
      "It’s reported that the departure of one or both of the unsettled forwards could pave the way for a deal, making it likely a waiting game until that happens.",
      "Onana's former club Inter Milan are reportedly monitoring his situation at Old Trafford.",
      "According to The Sun, Inter are keen on re-signing the goalkeeper, who enjoyed great success during his previous spell in Italy.",
      "Onana, 29, remains a cult hero among Inter fans, having played a key role in their run to the 2023 Champions League final, where they were narrowly beaten by Manchester City.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has claimed that Napoli have contacted Man United over a potential loan deal for Hojlund.",
      "This comes after Romelu Lukaku sustained an injury, with the Serie A giants reportedly inquiring about the conditions of a possible loan move.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that there is renewed belief Man United will step up their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Lammens during the final two weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Man United made a loan approach for Emi Martinez earlier this summer, but a move did not materialise.",
      "TEAMtalk add that, Bayindir’s mistake may prompt United to revisit the goalkeeper market and consider Lammens as their primary alternative to Martinez. The 23-year-old shot-stopper has also attracted interest from Inter Milan, but he reportedly has signaled a preference for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Jadon Sancho has rejected an offer from AS Roma after failing to reach an agreement on personal terms.",
      "The former England international is reportedly confident that other offers will come in. While there is interest from Turkey, including Besiktas, Sancho is not expected to consider those options until the main European transfer window closes.",
      "Roma are now looking at alternative options, while the Reds are hoping to find a suitor for Sancho, who doesn't even have a squad number this season.",
      "Hello and welcome to today’s live transfer blog, your go-to source for all things Man United.",
      "With just two weeks remaining in the transfer window, the focus is firmly back on potential ins and outs at Old Trafford.",
      "Grab a brew, settle in, and let’s get started!",
      "Leeds United picked up a narrow win to conclude the opening Premier League weekend.",

      "Manchester United lost their opening Premier League game against Arsenal, but there were positives to take from the performance, including Matthijs de Ligt's solid display.",
      "De Ligt, Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw limited Arsenal's chances throughout and were only denied a clean sheet due to an awful goalkeeping error from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "The back three's performance bodes well for the season and De Ligt, in particular, impressed as Arsenal attempted to create, winning eight duels, making six clearances, and winning five aerial duels.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli hardly had a sniff throughout the afternoon. De Ligt probably found Gyokeres on his kitchen table when he emptied his pockets when he returned home.",
      "Former England manager Glenn Hoddle worked as a pundit for Premier League Productions on Sunday and said: “There is excitement over the players he’s brought in, and they looked good, but I thought De Ligt was excellent. It was probably his best game in a United shirt, with the ball and defending.\"",
      "De Ligt was also outstanding when he played Arsenal at the Emirates in January, making important blocks and recovering from an improbable position to deny Leandro Trossard a tap-in.",
      "And when the 26-year-old spoke in pre-season, it was interesting to hear him promise there was more to come in the new campaign",
      "\"Sometimes me and other football fans forget my age,\" he said. \"And as a centre-back you’re normally in your prime at 28 or 29, so in that way, I’m still quite young. Personally, I’d love to carry on from how I was in March, April – I feel that is the level I could show and should show on a consistent basis.",
      "\"That’s my personal goal, and also to stay fit, that is really important. And then the goal with the team is to really show everybody what it is to play for United, and to get a positive vibe again around the team and the club.\"",
      "This season is important for De Ligt's future at Old Trafford. Jason Wilcox (director of football) will reportedly only make a solid assessment of a player after they have been afforded two seasons at United.",
      "That would be a logical approach because new signings should be given a season to settle into their new surroundings.",
      "De Ligt has spent 12 months in Manchester and his arrival coincided with the worst season at United for 51 years, so it was difficult for him to give the best account of himself.",
      "The good news is De Ligt made an impressive start to the new campaign against Arsenal on Sunday. Long may his that continue because United must qualify for European competition this season.",
      "Building a robust defensive foundation will be key to achieving that target, and centre-back is a strong area at United when Amorim's options are injury-free and available for selection.",
      "De Ligt, Yoro, Shaw, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are good options for the three starting positions. Shaw started on the left of the defence against Arsenal, but Martinez (currently recovering from a knee injury) and Heaven are also both best on that side.",
      "Yoro has the right side nailed down and it feels like the central role is between De Ligt and Maguire.",
      "Maguire might struggle to get back into the team if De Ligt consistently performs like he did against Arsenal.",

      "Manchester United's hopes of strengthening further in the summer transfer window are being severely restricted by a lack of sales at Old Trafford.",
      "United have yet to sell any of their wantaway stars this summer, with Marcus Rashford the most notable departure - leaving on loan to join Barcelona. Rashford's exit to the Catalan capital is thought to save United around £12million in wages, but it's sales that will move the dial with PSRs (Profit and Sustainability Rules).",
      "United's performance in defeat to Arsenal on Sunday was encouraging. Ruben Amorim's side looked a much more cohesive unit, despite beginning a crucial campaign with another loss.",
      "And, yet, no-one at M16 is under any illusion that more signings are not needed to strengthen a squad that has let down a succession of different managers over the years.",
      "Midfield and goalkeeper are the obvious areas which may need to be looked at. It's why there has been so much excitement around a potential pursuit of Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba - a player who is developing into one of the Premier League's finest midfielders at a rapid rate.",
      "The sticking point for United is the player's reported £100million-plus price tag. Brighton also appear adamant that their young star is not for sale - making any summer move extremely unlikely at this stage.",
      "But sales will boost the club's PSR position and offer a glimmer of hope that Baleba could yet end up in Manchester before the summer window closes on September 1.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has claimed that talks are advancing over Alejandro Garnacho's potential move to Chelsea. The Argentine leaving on a permanent deal would provide United with a significant PSR boost due to the wide-man's homegrown status - meaning his sale would represent pure profit.",
      "Elsewhere, striker Rasmus Hojlund has been perhaps mostly strongly linked with a move away over recent weeks. The Dane has fallen out of favour under Amorim - after Benjamin Sesko rocked up at Old Trafford for a big-money fee from RB Leipzig.",
      "Clubs from Italy have been most heavily linked - although a surprise switch to Fulham has, also, been mooted. That may now be complicated amid reports from the Mirror that Rodrigo Muniz's Craven Cottage exit has fallen through.",
      "The possible summer sales of Garnacho and Hojlund would be a welcome relief for everyone at M16. The focus would still likely be on selling the club's remaining wantaway assets - Jadon Sancho, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia - but there may yet be an opportunity to test Brighton's resolve on Baleba before the summer window closes.",

      "Between now and then, United are likely to be working on plenty of deals behind the scenes. United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, meaning there is now less than two weeks before United are no longer able to strengthen their squad.",
      "Much has been written and speculated about the goalkeeping position at United this summer. Andre Onana was not in the matchday squad against Arsenal, with Altay Bayindir called upon and the goalkeeper conceded against the Gunners has led to some criticism being directed at the Turkey international.",
      "A host of goalkeepers have been linked with moves to United this summer, including Gianluigi Donnarumma at Paris Saint-Germain and Emi Martinez at Aston Villa. There have also been rumours that Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp may also be a target for United.",
      "In a dream scenario, United would be able to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes and transform the defence available to Amorim this season. The financials for a deal for either Donnarumma or Martinez appear to be out of reach for United this summer, however, which could leave Lammens as the obvious target.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United have already been linked with signing a midfielder this summer, with Brighton star Carlos Baleba being a target just a week ago. That deal looks unlikely to happen, but United would still be wise to go into the market for reinforcements for the middle of the park.",
      "A host of names have been mentioned as potential targets, including Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton. Just like with a deal for Baleba, that would likely take a fee of more than £100million and would be out of United's price range for the time being.",
      "Despite this, United may need to sign a midfielder before the window closes. Morten Hjulmand and Lucien Agoume are other reported targets who could be more in United's price range.",
      "United need to sanction the exits of some members of the squad before the transfer window closes.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all still at Old Trafford despite informing the club earlier in the summer of a desire to leave.",

      "Lorenzo Lucca signed earlier this summer and will deputise for the Belgium international, but is now their only recognised centre-forward after they loaned Giovanni Simeone to Torino and Galatasaray re-signed Victor Osimhen.

      "Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United should look to sign Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma amid the club's goalkeeping issues.",
      "Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir was at fault for Arsenal's goal during Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford. It continued a worrying trend for the Turkish shot-stopper who made several mistakes last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being in United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle, where he made several blunders.",
      "Bayindir started against the Gunners with United's regular No.1 Andre Onana having only recently recovered from a hamstring injury after missing the entirety of the Reds' pre-season schedule. Onana also made several errors last season although Amorim insisted after Sunday's game that the Cameroonian had not been dropped against Mikel Arteta's team.",
      "United have been linked with several goalkeepers in the current summer transfer window, including PSG's Donnarumma. And legendary former club captain Rooney believes his old side should look to make a move for the Italian, who has also been heavily linked with rivals Manchester City.",
      "\"I think it has to be a thing,\" he said on his BBC Podcast. \"I go back to when we had Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in goal. I don't think there was 100 per cent trust from the defenders in front of them two goalkeepers, but the minute [Edwin] van der Sar comes in and calms everything down, the defenders trusted him a lot more.",
      "\"Andre Onana came in and he's a fantastic keeper, but he certainly didn't fill anyone with confidence last season. I think Donnarumma, he's 26, he's one of the best keepers in the world. It'd be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "When it was put to Rooney that Donnarumma's wage demands may be too much of a risk for the club, he replied: \"Well, I don't think he's a risk.",
      "\"I've seen a stat today, the errors leading to direct goals and his was zero. He's one of the best keepers in the world.\"",

The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",
      "AC Milan and Juventus have been most heavily linked in recent weeks, but a potential stay in the Premier League has now emerged. The Independent claim that United's next opponents, Fulham, are showing interest in the 22-year-old.",
      "It is reported that the possibility of Rodrigo Muniz leaving the London club could see them move for the striker. It has been suggested that United will want £40m for Hojlund.",
      "The young forward will get a good look at his potential new team when United travel to Craven Cottage on Sunday (4:30pm kick off UK time). While any chance of him featuring against Marco Silva's side is extremely unlikely, he will be able to assess what Fulham could offer.",
      "Silva's men began the new season on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion and needed a stoppage-time equaliser to rescue a point.",
      "It means both United and Fulham will be chasing their first three points of the 2025/26 campaign this weekend, and Hojlund will surely be watching with interest if the Cottagers' interest is genuine. There could yet be a redemption arc in English football for a player who has often looked out of his depth during a turbulent period at M16.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho will not play for Argentina in their upcoming World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Manchester United are set to sell Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old has been training on his own at Carrington for a month and has been frozen out of the squad.",
      "Garnacho was not involved against Arsenal for United's opening game of the season and the youngster has been left out of Argentina's squad for their World Cup qualifying fixtures against Venezuela and Ecuador next month.",
      "The United academy graduate made his Argentina debut in June 2023. Garnacho was consistently included in Argentina's squad throughout 2024, but his country has not called him up this year.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed.",
      "The youngster's relationship with Ruben Amorim deteriorated and he questioned his manager's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Napoli and Chelsea have been linked with a move for Garnacho. The player's representatives attended Stamford Bridge last season and Chelsea are regarded as the front runners for his signature.",

      "Manchester United's new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave plenty of reasons for United fans to be positive about this season, despite Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "That is the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder and BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy who felt the pair gave United an extra physical edge at Old Trafford compared to last season.",
      "United signed Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, while Mbeumo arrived in a deal that could reach £71million from Brentford.",
      "The pair scored 37 goals between them last season and while neither found the net against the Gunners, their overall performance has given Murphy reason to be positive about United's prospects this season.",
      "\"They are more dynamic, more direct, more confident,\" Murphy told Match of the Day. \"Physically, they looked really good and I think a lot of that comes from having players high up the pitch, especially the two new boys (Cunha and Mbeumo) who are just high in quality.",
      "\"It is like chalk and cheese (to last season). Man United fans, I think, can actually be quite positive about this.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, when asked about where United still need to strengthen, Murphy was clear a midfielder has to be the club's top priority in the transfer market.",
      "\"Some might think a goalkeeper, but I probably think a central midfielder if you are going to play Bruno Fernandes in there,\" Murphy added.",
      "\"Someone a bit more powerful than Casemiro and Ugarte, someone who can do a bit of running for him.",
      "\"Even if they don't get anybody, that front end of the pitch is going to make their season completely different because every team they play against is wary.\"",
      "The 33-year-old Casemiro started in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes against Arsenal and it is no secret Amorim wants more physicality in that department.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 in their opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hoping to start the new campaign with a positive result, but Arsenal opened the scoring at Old Trafford in the 13th minute after a mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "Bayindir failed to properly connect with the corner and Riccardo Calafiori was gifted an easy header at the back post. United responded well and created enough chances to equalise, but a breakthrough proved elusive.",
      "Here are the talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed:",
      "Arsenal analysts were not happy",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "Gabriel Martinelli overhit a simple pass to Martin Odegaard on the counter-attack, much to the relief of Amorim on the sidelines, but the Arsenal analyst did not hide his frustration at the move breaking down.",
      "The pair also looked unhappy when Arsenal were dispossessed near the end of the first half. United created enough chances to be level by the interval and Arsenal were only leading due to Bayindir's shocking error.",
      "The frustration proves Arsenal were not good enough on Sunday afternoon, and they were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Same old story",
      "There was a melee in the box with just a few minutes to play. United were desperately trying to score an equaliser and committed bodies forward, but it just wouldn't go in for them.",
      "Benjamin Sesko turned his effort over the bar, high into the Stretford End, and Amorim responded on the touchline by placing his hands on his head. United have spent close to £200million on their attack this summer, but the same problem existed against Arsenal: they couldn't score.",
      "Having said that, United were the better side. There were signs of progress and positives to take, despite an opening day defeat.",
      "Cunha the crowd favourite",
      "Matheus Cunha made an immediate impact in the dressing room after his arrival from Wolves. The Brazilian is a huge personality and is a stereotypical fiery South American, so it always seemed likely he would become a fan favourite.",
      "And Cunha took the first steps to earning fan favourite status against Arsenal. He looked dangerous and roared at the crowd just before the hour mark after a scrappy physical battle with William Saliba.",
      "The 26-year-old won the ball near the tunnel by the Stetford End corner, fighting aggressively against Saliba. He reacted by vigorously first pumping to the crowd, who lapped it up. Cunha plays on the edge and he helped to whip up the crowd as United pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Cunha has the quality to back up his behaviour. He delivered an impressive performance on his competitive Old Trafford debut and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.",
      "What did Amorim expect?",
      "Amorim decided to play without a recognised striker against Arsenal. Sesko was ready to start the game, but he was named on the bench and Amorim's front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Cunha was fluid.",
      "Those three players took turns to play down the middle and regularly rotated positions, but the downside of that selection was seen in the first half when Diogo Dalot pulled a ball back into the box and nobody was there.",
      "Amorim was spotted shouting at Mount, who was positioned outside the box, but what did United's head coach expect? He shouldn't have been surprised to see Mount fail to think like a striker.",
      "Sesko was eventually introduced to the game in the 65th minute. The Slovenia international struggled to get into the contest, but it might have been a different story if he'd been included in the starting team.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Avram Glazer was spotted in the directors' box. The 64-year-old last made an appearance at Old Trafford for the opening game of last season against Fulham and showed his face again for the visit of Arsenal.",
      "The 1958 had planned to stage a protest against the club's ownership before facing Arsenal, but they decided to postpone the demonstration after surveying fans about whether it should go ahead.",
      "Whether that had something to do with Avram Glazer attending the game is up for debate. The American co-owner has deliberately made limited appearances in Manchester over the last few years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was among those seated n the directors' box. The striker was dropped from the squad and is being ruthlessly shown the door by Amorim after taking huge backwards steps last season.",
      "JJ Gabriel was also seen in the directors' box against Arsenal. The youngster is just 14 years old, but there is a buzz at United about his potential and the invite to watch the game shows how highly he is regarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has agreed with the decision to allow Arsenal's winner against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice's cross into an empty net in the 13th minute after United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball away.",
      "Replays of the goal showed William Saliba in close proximity to the goalkeeper near the goal line but the goal stood. Bayindir flapped at the corner to allow Calafiori a free header, similar to one he conceded at Tottenham last season.",
      "\"It's going to keep hurting United, the goalkeeper has got to be stronger,\" Gary Neville said in his analysis of the goal. \"He'll complain that he's been fouled, there's a player in front of him, there's a lot of pushing and shoving.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper has to be stronger, get that player out the way, Saliba hasn't got his hands up, I don't think he's done anything at all. It goes through his hands, it's definitely a goal, he's just not strong enough. The delivery is sensational and they just don't deal with it.\"",
      "Roy Keane seconded Neville's verdict, insisting that Bayindir should have done much better. \"Of course (needs to be stronger). Fair play to Arsenal, it's a great delivery and they're attacking it but if you're the goalkeeper just take control of the six yard box.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"Goalkeepers and defenders complain all the time about players being in their face, you get in their face, take control of that six yard box. Complain all you want but the goalkeeper, be aggressive, it's your area, come with violence take control of it. Arsenal are very good at it but United [are] weak and soft.\"",
      "There had been calls that Bayindir was the subject of foul play from Saliba with some suggesting the goal should have been disallowed. However, Gallagher has rubbished these claims.",
      "Jay Bothroyd, who joined Gallagher on Ref Watch, said Bayindir should have gone down if he thought it was a foul. Bothroyd added: \"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City are reportedly set to go head-to-head in the transfer market for PSG's unsettled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The Italian has already made it clear he intends to leave the French capital this summer after being frozen out. Donnarumma was a standout performer for Les Parisiens during their Champions League triumph last season, yet the signing of French international Lucas Chevalier has seemingly pushed him towards the exit.",
      "Now, both the red and blue sides of Manchester are believed to be circling. Ruben Amorim's squad urgently need a dependable presence between the posts, with Altay Bayindir's shortcomings highlighted in their narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, and Andre Onana guilty of repeated errors throughout the previous campaign.",
      "City, in contrast, looked to have secured their long-term solution earlier this summer by re-signing James Trafford. However, with Ederson tipped to depart and strongly linked with a switch to Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola is reportedly keen on recruiting the 26-year-old Italy international.",
      "Where Donnarumma will end up isn't known, but the keeper he is no stranger to dramatic transfer sagas - most notably in 2017 when he renewed at AC Milan under controversial circumstances, with speculation over a contract clause involving his brother.",
      "Back in 2017, Donnarumma was still a teenager but had already cemented his place in Milan's first team, widely regarded as one of Europe's brightest young talents. With his deal expiring, he looked set for a high-profile move, with Juventus and Real Madrid monitoring him closely, before he made a surprising U-turn.",
      "Although his agent at the time, the late Mino Raiola, publicly claimed he would not extend his stay at San Siro, Donnarumma ultimately signed fresh terms until 2021 - reportedly with unusual conditions attached.",
      "Reports suggested that as part of the agreement, Milan were required to sign Donnarumma's older brother Antonio, then a 27-year-old goalkeeper with Asteras Tripolis. That £1m deal was finalised just a day after the younger sibling committed to his new contract.",
      "Antonio earned around £850,000 annually, roughly one-sixth of Gigio's salary. Still, Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, dismissed rumours of any binding clause.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he explained in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written. Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",
      "Antonio, who had previously been part of Milan's youth system before moving to Genoa, split opinion among supporters with his return. Yet he issued a heartfelt statement following his signing, which drew mixed reactions and still carries an air of intrigue.",
      "\"I will be in the dressing room with my brother, which makes me very happy. It is a beautiful thing to be back at Milan,\" said Antonio, who now represents Serie C outfit Salernitana.",
      "After his Milan contract expired, Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021 and is now on the verge of another move. Antonio also left the Rossoneri in 2019, transferring to Padova before later joining Torino and eventually finding his place at Salernitana.",

      "Wayne Rooney has urged Manchester United to make two signings before the transfer window closes, warning it would be “crazy” not to move for a solution to what he sees as a glaring goalkeeping problem.",
      "The United legend was speaking on his BBC podcast after watching Ruben Amorim’s side lose 1-0 to Arsenal on the opening weekend, with Altay Bayindir’s mistake proving costly at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana, who came under scrutiny last season, was left out of the squad entirely, with Amorim insisting the decision was tactical rather than down to injury.”",
      "Rooney believes the situation cannot be allowed to drift, insisting United’s defenders need to feel the same confidence his generation had once Edwin van der Sar arrived.",
      "“There’s the goalkeeper situation and I’m sure every Man United fan is asking the same question,” he said.",
      "“For me, Donnarumma is out there and if there’s a possibility you can get him, you have to go for him. Clearly that [the goalkeeper] is an issue.",
      "“I go back to when we had Roy Carroll and Tim Howard in goal. I don’t think there was 100 per cent trust from the defenders in front of those two goalkeepers.",
      "“But the minute Van der Sar came in and calmed everything down, the defenders trusted him a lot more and you see a better output of performance.",
      "“These United players want that confidence and trust in the goal behind them and I just don’t see that with the ones we’ve got at the moment.",
      "“With Donnarumma, he’s 26 and one of the best keepers in the world. It would be crazy if Manchester United didn’t go for him.”",
      "Rooney stressed the Italian’s salary demands could complicate matters, but believes United should at least be asking the question.",
      "He also offered a word of encouragement for Onana, who he says is capable of recapturing his Inter Milan form if Amorim decides not to pursue another option.",
      "“Andre Onana is a fantastic keeper, I watched him at Inter, and he was brilliant. So you hope if they don’t sign a new goalkeeper, he can get back to that level of form, but he certainly didn’t fill us with confidence last season.”",
      "Rooney also identified midfield as another area in need of reinforcement.",
      "United have been linked with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, and Rooney says addressing that department is just as important as resolving the goalkeeper issue.",
      "“You would be, yeah, but obviously we don’t know what the situation is with PSR,” he explained when asked if a new midfielder was a priority.",
      "“But to get a midfielder and a goalkeeper is a priority; if they can address that before the window closes, they will be in an okay place.”",
      "Paul Merson says Altay Bayindir has “already lost Man Utd points” and insists the club must act on their goalkeeper issue before the window closes.",
      "Legendary Premier League striker Wayne Rooney has leapt to the defence of Arsenal’s Viktor Gyokeres, urging patience and citing a lack of support.",
      "Romano has revealed Napoli have made ‘direct contact’ with Man Utd following the injury to Lukaku as a Serie A double deal is on the cards.",
      "Wayne Rooney has picked out two Man Utd players out as a “concern” after defeat to Arsenal on Sunday and fears for Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Andre Onana’s “feeling” on being left out of Manchester United’s squad to face Arsenal on Sunday afternoon.",

      "Manchester United could move for a keeper who snubbed West Ham – especially if Inter come for Andre Onana – while Alejandro Garnacho turned down a very good offer…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Bayern Munich\nGarnacho is sticking to his Chelsea guns, turning his nose up at Bayern who were looking to take the winger on loan. Which from the player’s perspective sounds like a very good opportunity. He needs to hope Chelsea are as sweet on him as he seems to be on them.",
      "",
      "19) John Victor – Botafogo to Manchester United\nThere are conflicting reports over who pied who – Big John or West Ham – when it was thought the goalkeeper was heading to the Hammers. But Tim Vickery, who knows his South American onions better than anyone, reckons it was the player who pulled out of the deal, and United could re-ignite their interest. The various reports seem speculative but the expectation is that United would at least get the goalkeeper on a plane.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Andre Onana – Manchester United to Inter Milan\nThe story goes that Inter are keen to bring Onana back to the San Siro, the memory of some level of goalkeeping competency apparently still fresh enough to look past the last two seasons at Old Trafford. Yann Sommer is 37 before Christmas so it makes sense for Inter to make succession plans. But we cannot imagine them presenting anything but a loan offer. Maybe that will be enough because United simply cannot afford to continue with their present goalkeeping situation.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Though things have since gone quiet again while Spurs have all the talks with Palace over Eze.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will want big money since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nThe two clubs were close enough for Dibling to miss Saints’ first couple of games and certain parts of training, but too far to say for sure that the move will happen. And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million. Maybe the performance at Leeds will persuade Everton to pay up.",

      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player has not taken it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media. Ooh, you’re hard.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\n“I think he is going to stay. I think. He told me that. But maybe tomorrow it changes.” Lewis seems very keen to stay but if City decide they want to cash in, there’s little the academy graduate can do. The right-back started at Wolves on Saturday, though, so he’s certainly not surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "11) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Nkunku in as part of the deal. It is clear Chelsea need to shift some deadwood before they can sign more forwards.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nHojlund was left out of the United squad beaten by Arsenal which suggests something is afoot, most likely involving Milan. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” said their sporting director Igli Tare on Sunday. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.” United want around £30million; Milan would obviously prefer to pay less or take the Denmark striker on loan first.",
      "",
      "8) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. The Reds, apparently, are ready to launch another bid, which we’d love Newcastle to reject only to see Isak’s reaction. But the situation is no more tolerable for Toon as it is for the Swede. Liverpool face Newcastle next Monday night, it seems most likely that something will happen after that.",

      "7) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG.

If only there was another club in Manchester who desperately need a competent goalkeeper…",

It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached. Galatasaray appear to be trying to speed City along by making it known they quite fancy Diogo Costa too.",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham Hotspur\nArsenal’s faffing has given Spurs a window and the way Eze lingered in front of the travelling Palace fans on Sunday could be viewed as a possible farewell by those who really want to interpret it that way. The latest update suggests Tottenham and Palace are talking after Eze expressed a willingness to move. Spurs currently offering £55million plus £5million in add-ons. Eze’s release clause, worth £68million, expired last week.",

Romano says it’s down to ‘final details’ before Luiz flies in for a medical.",

      "Sancho has been deemed surplus to requirements this summer, with United making clear they want him gone before the market closes.",
      "His contract, worth upwards of £250,000 per week, has only added urgency as the club looks to free space on the wage bill and raise funds for reinforcements.",
      "United have already invested heavily in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, so any extra relief they can generate by moving Sancho on and securing a fee could be vital in funding further late-window business.",

      "Other approaches have also been dismissed, with Amorim unwilling to reintegrate him regardless of how long he remains at Old Trafford.",
      "That backdrop leaves United desperate for a resolution before September 1.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, however, Sancho is more relaxed about the deadline. The winger is prepared to wait beyond this window if the right permanent opportunity does not emerge and would even consider reassessing his options in January.",
      "That stance is designed to protect his long-term future, with Sancho conscious that he could secure a stronger move if he holds his ground.",
      "But it collides directly with United’s urgency to close the door now and stop one of their highest earners drifting through the autumn without a role.",
      "The concern for United’s hierarchy is that Sancho’s patience forces their hand. They may be left with little choice but to sanction a loan on deadline day, knowing that a permanent fee looks unlikely unless he changes his position.",
      "For Amorim, the timing could not be worse. United’s manager has already moved Marcus Rashford on to Barcelona and wants the chance to reshape his squad with fresh signings before the window shuts.",

      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £148.1m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",

      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",

      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",

      "12=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "7) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "6) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Arsenal) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Leeds) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Brighton) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Fulham) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Aston Villa) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Chelsea) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Crystal Palace) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Newcastle) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Everton) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Manchester United) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Bournemouth) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Brentford) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "",
      "10) Liverpool will break the goal record\nArne Slot basically telling Jamie Carragher to support a different team if he was “worried” about Liverpool committing too many players forward in a 4-2 win was enjoyable.",
      "“We are a team that likes to attack. We are a team that wants to score goals,” he said, as if adding a £69m striker and £100m playmaker to a group of options also including the third-highest scorer in the club’s history had not already underlined, italicised and emboldened the point.",
      "It did make the £150m record pursuit of another forward seem like a bit of a luxury but Liverpool are blessed with quality rather than quantity across their frontline. Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Ben Doak have been sold for almost as much as Alexander Isak would cost.",
      "Another ingredient might well be added to the mix before the deadline but even without it, the 106-goal platter Manchester City delivered the first Pep Guardiola title on should be a tentative target.",
      "",
      "9) At least one of the four out-of-contract managers announce their exit before the end of the season\nBournemouth and Wolves were beaten by Premier League title challengers, while Crystal Palace and Fulham emerged from difficult away assignments with creditable draws.",
      "That only reinforced the frustration felt by three of those four desirable Premier League coaches in the final year of their deals.",
      "Andoni Iraola has since been endowed with an overdue centre-half and attacking depth in Bafode Diakite and Ben Gannon-Doak. But Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva and Vitor Pereira have all reiterated the need for new and ready-made signings.",
      "Perhaps the clubs involved would prefer a more long-term show of commitment from those who expect to be supplied expensive new toys, but each of those managers could feasibly punch a little higher in their relationships.",
      "",
      "8) Parker and Potter are sacked\nIt is a point worth repeating from the first Winners and Losers of the season: bemoaning an inability to do “the basics” against a newly-promoted side or blaming “fine margins” as a newly-promoted side, both in 3-0 defeats, does not augur well on the opening weekend.",
      "Burnley might have expected to be in for a long season and Scott Parker deserves credit for taking a different approach to his latest bid for survival. But this one looked roughly as doomed as his previous attempts even before a ball was kicked.",
      "Graham Potter was an early sack race frontrunner after the general misery with which last season ended at West Ham, and such a chastening defeat to Sunderland meant the wait for any semblance of an identity to emerge under his tutelage has reached 20 games and a pre-season.",
      "The recruitment has not been nearly good enough for either club to achieve their objectives, but ultimately two managers who have suffered their fair share of sackings know where the buck stops for fidgety owners. The race to appoint Sean Dyche will be unseemly.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and Sunderland will stay up\nFor the first time since 2021/22, and only the third time ever in Premier League history, as many as two newly-promoted teams won on the opening weekend.",
      "The scorelines were slightly different for Sunderland and Leeds, the first Championship winners to start in the top flight with a win since the Black Cats in 2007. But both overcame established members of what has proven a particularly closed shop in the past couple of seasons.",
      "There has been a slight overegging of the pudding in terms of fretting about the gulf between the Premier League and Football League based on six laughably underprepared and low-quality sides coming up to go straight down – especially as the four most recent sides to survive that jump seamlessly became part of the apparently unmovable furniture.",
      "But in sinking those early six-pointers, leaving a mark on teams they can feasibly usurp and building momentum in front of raucous home crowds after solid to spectacular summer recruitment drives, Sunderland and Leeds have already shown enough to suggest they can hold their own.",
      "",
      "6) Brentford will go down\nThat does require the demise of two supposedly protected and untouchable teams, but Brentford always felt unsuited to that elite casting and the vultures have done a number on them.",
      "Dango Ouattara has signed, Mikkel Damsgaard will return and Jordan Henderson should bring experience and nous to a team suddenly lacking in both, but it is difficult to envisage Keith Andrews making much sense of the hand he has been dealt.",
      "But ultimately the biggest count against Brentford might be that there is no obvious firefighter appointment for when the panic sets in. They are not tempting the Sam Allardyces, Alan Pardews or Tony Pulises of this world off the after-dinner circuit, but absolutely could do the sort of absurd thing data-led clubs do when the wheels come off a little and make a damning call to someone like Jesse Marsch in February.",
      "",
      "5) Erling Haaland will break his own goal record\nThere is definitely a shout for Tijanji Reijnders to win the PFA Player of the Year award after proving that the tough First Guardiola Year is not actually a prerequisite for any new Manchester City signing.",
      "But a safer bet might be Haaland recovering from the shame of 38 and 34-goal seasons to start testing the structural integrity of Dixie Dean’s legacy again.",
      "A ludicrous level of attacking quality, depth and variety is contained within that Manchester City squad, spearheaded by a striker whose brilliance has been normalised. The goal record he set in his debut season is going to fall.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal will win a trophy\nIt is difficult to recall another manager or team at the start of any Premier League season whose success or failure was so specifically dependent on the procurement of trophies.",
      "Mikel Arteta promised to “give my life” to deliver silverware at the end of last season and a great many critics appear to have taken that literally, stating that this phase must be his last if he cannot drag Arsenal over the line.",
      "Oliver Glasner matching his trophy haul in a fraction of the time and on a fragment of the budget at Crystal Palace has not helped but Arsenal do feel set up to book that open-top bus tour soon.",
      "Say what you want about their entire attacking ethos centering around set-pieces, or everyone at the club being willing to sacrifice friends and family members for the mere chance at keeping a clean sheet. But this is surely a side designed to excel in knockout football once Viktor Gyokeres gets up to speed – if indeed the pub striker ever will.",
      "",
      "3) Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace will reign in Europe\nUEFA would be obliged to change the Super Cup regulations – presumably without sending any correspondence to Selhurst Park – so that the Europa League and Conference League winners would compete in a blood feud as the Champions League winners step aside.",
      "But after watching Premier League sides go deep or even win either competition in recent years, there is a sense that things might work out in the end for both teams.",
      "If Spurs can win the Europa League then Forest are absolutely capable out of sheer Morgan Gibbs-White-based spite, while Glasner has already delivered continental glory to Eintracht Frankfurt so can help continue the proud Premier League tradition of bullying teams they have a laughable financial advantage over.",
      "",
      "2) There will be an England bolter\nTake your pick from the expensive uncapped Englishmen capable of snatching the spotlight who have been signed this summer alone: Jamie Gittens, Jacob Ramsey, Omari Hutchinson, Jarell Quansah, Liam Delap, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, James Trafford.",
      "Then there is Elliot Anderson and Archie Gray, who could easily time their pushes perfectly to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "It wouldn’t be an international tournament season without an England bolter and the options this time around are plentiful.",

      "1) The Big Six is the top six\nIt is a common misconception and refrain that the branding of the Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs cabal is not reflective of the actual league table.",
      "The fact is it was never meant to be: those are simply the richest Premier League teams in a football sense. Their owners are not necessarily the most wealthy but the clubs themselves are more marketable than the rest in the country by an absurd margin and so can pay the highest transfer fees and wages with less pressure on sales.",
      "It is why talk of there being a Big Eight with Newcastle or Aston Villa included is nonsense, similar to suggestions that the Big Six are no longer a thing when one or even multiple members endure historically poor seasons. Manchester United and Spurs responded by just signing everyone else’s best players because they could.",
      "And they looked better for it. Manchester United leapt over a hilariously low bar against Arsenal, granted, and Spurs passed the test of playing a promoted Scott Parker side at home. But the improvements were clear and fuelled at least in part by weakening many of their rivals this summer.",
      "The so-called Big Six has been the top six in some order or other on precisely six occasions: 2010/11, 2014/15, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2021/22. This will be lucky number seven.",
      "Manchester United could move for a keeper who snubbed West Ham – especially if Inter come for Andre Onana – while Alejandro Garnacho turned down a very good offer…",
      "The message to Arsenal supporters is clear: ‘if you want to slap yourself to a frothy lather’ over being ‘out-played’ by Manchester United then go for it.",
      "Will Newcastle face a ‘transfer backlash’ over Alexander Isak? Big players just ‘want assurances’ they can go when the time is right – like a release clause.",
      "‘It feels like Arsenal more than any team in the league is going to drive headlines, agendas and narratives more than ever this season,’ says one supporter.",
      "Arsenal fans are out in force to defence their club and their new ‘Viking clogger’, but there are also views on Bournemouth, Brentford, Spurs and more.",
      "Sunderland and Manchester City could not have planned better starts, while a Liverpool hero stepped up. And West Ham should “panic about its managers”."

      "A marginally better Manchester United – mainly down to their new forwards – still losing a football match.",
      "The bottom line is this. It’s pointless buying lovely new furniture from IKEA if your foundations are still wobbly and the roof is still leaking.",
      "Behind the three shiny new toys up front remain the same old problems. Really crap goalkeepers. Slow, cumbersome centre backs (they didn’t really get tested by Arsenal yesterday, but they will soon enough). A disjointed central midfield into which they have to shoehorn Bruno (not his best position) alongside the knackered Casemiro or the frankly really bad Ugarte.",
      "Here’s how it’s going to go. Amorim will be gone by November. Then, United being United, despite spending 9 months buying players for his silly 3-4-3, will appoint a 4-2-3-1 coach. Who will then inform Jason Wilcox that he needs a keeper, his centre backs are only fit for a back 3, and he needs full backs not wing backs. More churn will ensure. And off we go again, rubbernecking at the latest car crash.",
      "It’ll never not be funny.\nAndy H, Swansea.",
      "",
      "All about Arsenal\nI was listening to the radio for some build up before the Man U v Arsenal match and someone mentioned that once the opening day fixtures were set then it was inevitable that the biggest headline will be generated from this match – with a bit of an assumption that there was a winner and loser to the match rather than a draw.",
      "It was a very agreeable point.  What I didn’t expect is for Arsenal to win AND be the team that faced an absolute mountain of criticism.  Man U meanwhile getting plenty of plaudits for showing signs of improvement.",
      "Of course an element of this shows where the expectations stand for each side this season but come on, its been a bit over the top right?  Man U with their reshaped attack will clearly not be as toothless as they were last season and so will give most sides a damn good game at home.  Arsenal had by far the hardest opening day fixture of all the big teams and went and won ugly and got the 3 points.",
      "If you offered Liverpool, City and Chelsea that same result delivered in the same fashion they’d snap your hand off right now.  I can say with some certainty that fans of those 3 clubs (plus others) will have watched that game thinking it was a real chance for early dropped points from a potential title rival.",
      "It feels like Arsenal more than any team in the league is going to drive headlines, agendas and narratives more than ever this season. Gyokeres is the most scrutinised and under pressure player in the league before a ball was kicked despite plenty of more expensive players and strikers being signed by other teams,  and every Arsenal result will be followed by a ridiculous over reaction swaying to the negative as much as possible.  I understand some sections of Arsenal fans are also prone to this boom or bust emotive responses to each result but you’d hope for more balance in the media.",
      "I find the narrative around Arsenal and Arteta strange.  There is a lot of talk about how Arsenal MUST win the title or champions league this season, despite not winning the former for 24 years and never winning the later.  Why is it only Arsenal who MUST win it – surely the same must apply to Liverpool and City in the context of a failed or successful season?  Some people say Arteta MUST be sacked if he doesn’t win it – its such a weird stance to take without applying any context (or any knowledge of how the Arsenal board traditionally treat their managers – stability overides dreaming and ambition).  What if Arteta did a Klopp and got 97 points but finished 2nd – is that worthy of the sack?",
      "Finally, those who talk about the two things above will often happily talk about the plethora of flaws in this Arsenal team.  Too reliant on set pieces, don’t score enough goals, lack creativity, don’t have a killer goalscorer, poor on transitions, play sideways football, no superstars to win games on their own, etc etc.  So a long list of reasons why Arsenal will fall short and are not as good as Liverpool or City but also they MUST win the title.  Talk about having your cake and eating it.",
      "The season is 1 game old and Arsenal have won a very tough game whilst not being anywhere near their best, not everything needs to provoke such extreme and often negative reactions that a lot of people seem to fall in to with Arsenal more than anyone else.\nRich, AFC",
      "",
      "It all began with the set-pieces\nIt’s hard to believe it is the same manager that was in charge of Arsenal in 2022/23 season. Without the early season expectation of a title challenge, Arteta masterminded some of the best attacking display in the premier league, certainly the best of his own career.",
      "But since then it seems he’s crumbled under the pressure of actually being considered a contender. He’s become more pragmatic and dull every subsequent season, stockpiling big burly defenders and relying heavily on set-pieces.",
      "Ah. Set-pieces. The exploitation and subsequent reliance on it has become the beginning and apparently the end of Arsenal’s attacking creativity. Arsenal’s set-pieces, initially the clever aside, the unexpected dagger from the shadows, have become the entire arsenal (pun intended). What began as a complement, a glimmer of ingenuity, now stands exposed as the only idea, leaving the rest of the attack muted, meek and mechanical.",
      "And you can feel it in the players. The thrill is unmistakable — the flicker of excitement, and perhaps more worryingly, the sigh of relief, when they’ve won a corner. Watch them: the way they jostle for positions in the various needlessly elaborate routines. The training ground has become a theatre for the mastery of set-pieces, endless hours spent perfecting patterns that mask the withering of invention elsewhere. Why strain to carve an opening against opponents who are not utterly hapless, when the shortcut is so simple — a well-struck delivery to the big lads waiting in the box?",
      "And it’s not confined to the players. The set-piece coach now struts into the limelight, basking in the role of architect, eager to collect his applause for another blueprint executed to the letter.",
      "And it works — wildly so. The numbers speak for themselves, and the goals have flowed from corners and free-kicks in recent years. Yet the truth gnaws at the edges: it isn’t enough. It was never going to be.",
      "Because when the smoke clears, when the scraps are tallied, Arsenal’s reliance on dead-ball ingenuity exposes a deeper, more troubling stagnation. Their chief creator, Ødegaard, once the conductor, now looks dulled, his artistry blunted by the straightjacket of Arteta’s rigid design. What was once improvisation and daring has congealed into repetition and habit.",
      "If Arsenal are to make the final leap — from contenders to champions, from hopefuls to holders — they cannot climb there on corners alone. Arteta, too, must evolve, must rediscover the courage to let his side breathe and create in open play.",
      "If the football does not grow sharper, braver, more alive, the dream of a league title will remain just that — a dream, slipping further away with every set-piece celebrated like salvation. And the only thing truly set in stone will be the manager’s fate.\nAYK",
      "",
      "When does style matter?\nChris from Croydon commented that a win means more at this stage than how you win.  Sure, I buy it.  Cliches aside, 3 points in an opening game to shake off the booze and babes of a few weeks off seems logical.",
      "But at the end of last season, I kept reading the same thing.  It doesn’t matter how you win during the run-in; it only matters that you win.  1-0 with a deflected goal in the 91st minute after playing like a group of strangers for the first 90: absolutely fine.  But it did get me thinking.  When does it actually matter how you play so we can all judge Arsenal fairly?",
      "I would think we could all agree on matchweek 6 through 30.  5 games to get started and 8 games at the end where the tension builds and you win any way you can.  Thoughts on a postcard?\nNiall, Annapolis",

It’s an easy way to nullify that aspect of Arsenal’s Pulisball routines, and as we saw from the game, without their set-piece dickery, they don’t have a lot else in attack.

Here is a sample of the demented Trumpian lies and bullshit that the unhinged “MAKE ARTETA GREAT AGAIN” loons are flooding you with.",
      "Exhibit A: Outright lies and misinformation from Rob AFC:\n“ Arteta is on 10m not 15m”",
      "Factually incorrect. 365 literally have an article breaking down salaries, which is backed up by various sources. You’ll see clearly that Arteta is on £15.6m a year – Google AI also confirms the exact same figure of £15.6m. So the question is: why are Arsenal fans lying? 🤔",

      "Yes. Nothing to do with El Pulizon being paid insane wages for failure, nothing to do with the perpetual arrogance and egotism of a delusional fanbase that continues to insert themselves and Arteta into “elite” conversation (despite having less PL pedigree than Championship Leicester over the past 20 years!) Indeed, fans of Liverpool must be incandescent with that paltry PL title, Chelsea with their club World Cup, and Citeh with their 4 PL titles in the past 5 years, whilst Arsenal and Paella Pulis have been a punchline eh! 😂. Not being able to clap back at even Newcastle and Palace in fact is shameful and a humiliation.",
      "In fact… I’m sure even the Spurs fans spend every waking hour wishing they’d beaten Arsenal in a meaningless PL fixture, instead of that European trophy they just lifted. This exposes the difference in mentalities: other clubs focus on actual trophies, Arsenal fans simply invent parallel reality trophies (“the unbeaten v Big Six” Trophy being the latest). Remember what El Fraudo said: “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years” their dear Leader told the sheeple. And the MAGA loons swallowed the lie. whole! Not one of them has yet been able to explain this outright lie. Weird eh?",

      "Really simple one this: opinions are subjective debatable points, based on an individual’s personal worldview. Hence why eg newspapers have “opinion” sections. An individual is free to supplement that opinion with facts (eg it is my opinion that Arteta is an overpaid fraud, supplemented by evidence of a €1bn + spend, zero PLs, zero CLs, zero trophies in five years, spanked by first season Slot etc).",
      "The onus to supplement a viewpoint with hard evidence is incumbent when that point of view is presented as Fact – not an opinion 🙄🙄",
      "So, for instance, when your Dear Leader flagrantly lies in a press conference and says “Arsenal have more points than any team over the last three years”, this is a statement of Fact – and it should be backed up with hard evidence. Same as claiming “Luis Enrique told us we were the better team” – another lie, laid bare by Enrique contradicting it immediately. That factual clarification never happened because Arteta is a fraud who is telling lies to cover for his ineptitude. Utterly demented these AFC fans LOL",

      "How interesting a take this is, given the years of sanctimonious bollocks we heard from Arsenal fans about Mourinho “anti-football” and “I would never want to win playing such a brand of dour football after all the money spent”. Reminds me of when MSNBC takes a months-old clip of a Trump sycophant making excoriating statements on Biden “It’s a disgrace Biden would ever have discussions with Putin”…and then show you that exact same boot-licker hypocritically making the opposite point, months later “President Trump is a hero for hosting Putin” 😂😂😂",

      "*For all that Chelsea fans were understandably excited to see their expensive new signings, they were kept relatively quiet by a Crystal Palace team that finished last season so strongly. I think it’s good that Trevoh Chalobah is still getting regularly opportunities to start for Chelsea, plenty of us feared the worst for his progress when he was recalled from his Palace loan spell last season but he’s played well, and played a big part in keeping Jean-Philippe Mateta relatively quiet this weekend.",
      "*Eberechi Eze’s free kick goal was correctly ruled out, but it was still an understandable source of frustration. Palace were correctly punished for Marc Guehi being too close to the defensive wall when the ball was struck, but all that did was highlight how often teams are not punished for the same infringement. Still, the easiest way to not be penalised for something is to not do it in the first place.",
      "*Eze and Guehi’s futures at Palace have been the subject of a lot of speculation recently, as tends to happen with standout players outside of the biggest clubs. It’s to their credit that they didn’t seem to let any of it affect their performances. At least we’ve been largely spared the use of body language experts this time. Oliver Glasner casually mentioning after the match that Eze’s release clause had expired was a fun moment, and should Arsenal miss out on signing Eze, it’ll only serve them right.",
      "*One thing Arsenal can take comfort from is something Glasner said about his signings last summer. Palace made a slow start in part because their signings took a while to get up to speed. He mainly meant this about Ismaila Sarr, but it also applies to Eddie Nketiah, appropriately enough for Arsenal. As soon as it became apparent there was interest from Palace in signing those players, they were ostracised from the first team so as not to taint the atmosphere and as a result missed a lot of preseason. It is entirely possible that Sporting took similar action with Viktor Gyokeres, which perhaps explains why he was so far below expectations against Manchester United.",
      "*Ben Doak to Bournemouth looks set to go ahead for relatively big money. Unlike Jordon Ibe or Dominic Solanke, he won’t be their record signing (never break your transfer record to sign a Liverpool player), so he should do well for them.",

      "Sunderland and Liverpool showed the virtue of just chucking in a load of debutants on the opening weekend, while a couple of clubs had no new faces at all.",
      "Here we’re counting club league debutants for each side – so those who have played for other Premier League clubs or turned out for their new sides in other competitions since arriving are included – but those who have previously played for their clubs in the Championship or on loan aren’t included.",
      "",
      "0 – Fulham and Crystal Palace\nHardly surprising, since they have all of three new signings between them, two of which are second-choice goalkeepers.",
      "Palace new boy Borna Sosa did make the bench for Palace for their trip to Chelsea, but.",
      "",
      "1 – Aston Villa, Brighton, Everton (+ 2 subs), Newcastle, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham (+1 sub), Wolves (+2 subs)\nVilla keeper Marco Bizot kept a clean sheet against a Newcastle side that featured Anthony Elanga in the starting line-up.",
      "Elanga’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, Dan Ndoye, was meanwhile thrown straight in against Brentford and headed home their second goal in an all-round superb performance from Nuno Espirito Santo’s side.",
      "Brighton left-back Maxim de Cuyper was robbed of those four sweet FPL clean sheet bonus points thanks to Fulham’s late equaliser, and David Moller Wolfe will have easier days for Wolves than he did in their four-goal defeat to Manchester City. Fer Lopez and Jhon Arias both appeared from the bench for Vitor Pereira’s side.",
      "Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was unable to inspire Everton against Leeds, nor were subs Jack Grealish or Thierno Barry.",
      "But the pick of the line debutants was Mohammed Kudus, who made an immediate impression at Spurs by claiming two assists in their 3-0 win over Burnley. He was joined on the pitch briefly by late sub Joao Palhinha.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE ON F365\n👉 Guardiola and Wolves left with same hope: that New Man City really are as good as they looked\n👉 Richarlison, Kudus have Spurs dreaming, flying start for Sunderland, you fear for Hammers – it’s the 3pm Blackout",
      "",
      "2 – Arsenal (+1 sub), Chelsea (+2 subs), Manchester United (+1 sub), West Ham (+1 sub)\nBoth Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim had a pair of new arrivals in their starting line-ups: Viktor Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi for Arsenal, Mattheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for Manchester United. Noni Madueke and Benjamin Sesko joined the fray for their respective sides later on. We have 16 Conclusions if you’d like.",
      "Joao Pedro and Jamie Gittens both made their Premier League debuts from the start for Enzo Maresca’s side against Palace, with Liam Delap and Estevao replacing them in the second half, but none of them did anything to stop the game finishing goalless. (Andrey Santos also made his Premier League debut from the bench after signing in 2023 but spending the past couple of years out on loan…but we’re talking about new signings here, so we’re not going to count him.)",
      "Fat lot of good El Hadji Malick Diouf, Mads Hermansen, and late sub Callum Wilson for for West Ham against Sunderland, either. Eesh.",
      "",
      "3 – Bournemouth, Brentford (+1 sub), Burnley (+4 subs), Leeds (+2 subs), Manchester City (+1 sub)\nPep Guardiola answered the question of whether James Trafford was brought back to replace Ederson or play second fiddle by throwing him straight in alongside Rayan Ait-Nouri and the excellent Tijjani Reijnders, with Rayan Cherki coming off the bench to score a hugely impressive City’s fourth against Wolves.",
      "Bournemouth’s new-look back line included goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic behind defenders Bafode Diakite and Adrien Truffert, who put up a respectable fight against Liverpool before falling to a late defeat",
      "Burnley have brought in 10 new faces so far summer and fielded seven of them against Tottenham, albeit the marginal majority came off the bench.",
      "Brentford handed immediate starts to Caoimhin Kelleher, Michael Kayode and Antoni Milambo, with some lad called Jordan Henderson coming off the bench, but it was Brentford’s departures that were more keenly felt as they fell to a comprehensive 3-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest.",
      "Leeds had lift-off against Everton thanks to free agent Lukas Nmecha, who Daniel Farke said had “paid everything back – but we didn’t pay for him!”.",
      "The Whites also started Lucas Perri in net, Gabriel Gudmundsson at left-back and large man Anton Stach in midfield, with large man Sean Longstaff taking to the pitch as a sub.",
      "",
      "4 – Liverpool\nArne Slot put all four of his high-profile signings straight into the side to face Bournemouth, but none of Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Florian Wirtz or Hugo Ekitike completed the 90 minutes – despite Ekitike making it two goals from two following his strike in the Community Shield last weekend.",
      "",
      "7 – Sunderland (+1 sub)\nDidn’t exactly need time to gel, did they?",
      "Robin Roefs, Reinildo Mandaya, Habib Diarra, Noah Sadiki, skipper Granit Xhaka, Simon Adingra and Chemsdine Taibi were all chucked in and delivered the goods in Sunderland’s 3-0 win over West Ham United, with Omar Alderete coming off the bench to set up Sunderland’s final goal.",

      "Neville has based this call on Man Utd’s performance against Arsenal, while he reckons their next potential signing could make a huge difference.",
      "“Last season, I remember watching Chelsea on the first game of the season and, at that point, no one had Chelsea finishing in the top four I watched them against City and I thought: ‘They are not bad, that will do damage this season, that’s a good team’.",
      "“When I watched United [against Arsenal], I thought the performance was very good and I think they will get a goalkeeper. I’m banking on that – they will not make the mistake of not getting a goalkeeper in.",
      "“When you bring a goalkeeper in, and you have those players up front with that front line and you have no European football, I think they will surprise people.",
      "“Last week I had them finishing sixth to eighth, but I thought the performance was really good and I genuinely liked it.",
      "“They were high energy… and it was a dominant performance against a top-three team. When United have beaten a top-three team in the last five, six, or seven years, it has been smash and grabs on the counterattack.",

      "“I think they are all in with an equal chance so I’ve got no certainty that Arsenal are going to win it,” Neville admitted.",

The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",

      "Manchester United ‘can afford’ top midfield target Carlos Baleba this summer and ‘could revive a deal’ for the Brighton star despite reports claiming they’ve walked away from his possible transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have held talks over a move for Baleba via intermediaries and then directly with Brighton this month to sound them out over a deal, but with the Seagulls wanting £100m+, The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed on Friday that United had decided not to push ahead with talks.",
      "‘Manchester United are not planning to proceed with a move for Carlos Baleba before the transfer window closes,’ he wrote.",
      "‘Moving to Old Trafford appeals to Baleba so personal terms would have presented no problem — and the Cameroon international is prepared to keep pushing, even if it means waiting until the future.",
      "‘That does not suggest he is unhappy at Brighton and the dialogue has been cordial, with United respecting their stance.’",
      "But The Standard, while offering no more information besides, claim ‘a deal could be revived’ for the 21-year-old, and football finance expert Dan Plumley insists United “can afford him if they want him”.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “Ultimately, and we’ve said this before with other players this summer, Man United can afford him if they want him.",
      "“They have got options to draw upon. There’s a credit facility, a revolving one that we think has been drawn down.",
      "“We’ve seen the way they’ll stagger instalments for other players that they’ve brought in as well.",
      "“In terms of general affordability, the answer is still yes. I think the interesting thing on the fee is if it is going to be £100m or in and around that figure, then it probably won’t happen this summer.",
      "“That would be the other way to look at it, because that then is a significant outlay on top of what they’ve already spent this summer.",
      "“If the fee’s gonna be that high, I think that probably means they wouldn’t look at him this summer, but if they think a deal can be done further down the line, next year seems more likely.",
      "“Can they afford him this summer? Yes, in the bigger picture, but £100m now, given where the window’s at, probably not.”",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",
      "A Manchester United legend has told the club they “can’t pay” £100million for a “kid’ they don’t know “which way he’s going to go,” but the key to the transfer ...",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports."

      "And the reigning Serie A champions have held talks with Manchester United on Monday over a move for Rasmus Hojlund, who didn’t make the squad for the Red Devils’ opening day defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Romano also revealed that despite reports linking Joshua Zirkzee with an exit this summer, United want to retain him in a ‘clear plan by Amorim’.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Napoli had direct contact with Man United today following Romelu Lukaku’s injury as he’ll be out more than 3 months. Napoli asked for loan deal conditions for Rasmus Højlund. Man United want to keep Joshua Zirkzee, no talks despite links today. Clear plan by Rúben Amorim.’",
      "Ben Jacobs later confirmed that United may listen to loan moves despite wanting his permanent exit.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Manchester United want Hojlund to depart. £40m asking price, but #MUFC could yet entertain a loan under the right conditions despite the preference to sell.’",
      "Andre Onana was also left out of the squad against Arsenal, with Altay Bayindir starting and costing the Red Devils a point to pile the pressure on the goalkeeping department at Old Trafford.",
      "Pressed on Onana’s absence, Amorim confirmed after the game: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claimed Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad because he is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "But the Cameroon may be offered the chance of an exit according to The Sun, who claim former club Inter ‘are interested in re-signing a player who was a massive success in Italy’, whom United signed from them for £46m in the summer of 2023.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Inter chiefs believe Onana – who joined United after that defeat in Istanbul in a £47million deal – would be open-minded to a return to the San Siro.",

      "But Hackett, a former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief, insists Hooper was right not to give the spot kick.",
      "The former referee told Football Insider: “There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha. The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick.",
      "“The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error. Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it.",

      "He added: “I was less than satisfied with the referee’s performance. When you’ve got fouls taking place, but the referee is completely ignoring them without a signal of advantage, it opens up the question of whether he’s seen it or not.",
      "“Hooper’s approach was, ‘I’ll keep the game going. I’ll stay low-key’, but in doing so, the game at times was bubbling. The discipline of both sets of players was good so that helped him.",
      "“But, he was inconsistent and lacked authority, lacked an understanding of when to put his foot on the ball. It was an indifferent performance, and he was lucky not to have a mass confrontation.",

      "But while plenty have given him the benefit of the doubt given it was only one game, Leboeuf has told Mikel Arteta to change his tactics to suit Gyokeres or risk having a Hojlund situation in his hands.",
      "“My concern is, why do you recruit a player like Gyokeres when you know that the rest of the team won’t play that way?” Leboeuf asked on ESPN. “And they won’t do what you are expecting them to do – cross the ball a little bit quicker, without turning around, like you are playing handball.”",

      "Despite this, Romano claims Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad becuase hs is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",

      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",

      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",
      "If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.",
      "No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.",
      "It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.",
      "The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.",

      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",
      "That was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.",

      "City have an unbelievable spine.",
      "I went for the team I've been going for the last three years, they're reliable and solid and consistent, which is important. They just have to sort that forward bit of the pitch out and I think Viktor Gyokeres will.",

      "What I saw in the Community Shield, I didn't think I'd see on Friday night. I'm sure the manager has been speaking to the players in pre-season [about vulnerability] on the back of the Milan game, the Community Shield and to see it in three high profile games that did worry me a little bit. But if Liverpool fix that they have great firepower.",
      "A few days ago, I thought Arsenal would be Liverpool's biggest challengers. But the way they played [at Man Utd] was typical Arsenal of last season - the name of the game is winning games - it will be interesting over the next few weeks if we see them open up more, create more chances and see how they've evolved from last season.",
      "I was really impressed with Manchester City and I think it's Manchester City who might be Liverpool's closest challengers.",
      "Neville - Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd",
      "I've done this now for eight years, and I've always had Man Utd in the top four every year!",
      "It was a late change but with a bit of science… When I watched United against Arsenal, I thought the performance was very good. I think they'll get a goalkeeper and, with those players up front, with no Champions League or Europa League, I think Man Utd will surprise a few people. If you perform like that, you'll win a lot of football matches.",
      "And I'm not sure Chelsea are going to find it as easy with the Club World Cup, European games, all the demands of that.",
      "Carragher - Man City, Arsenal, Chelsea",
      "I think you have to be very careful about getting carried away about one performance. Man Utd lost and at no stage in the game did I think Man Utd were going to score a goal. They did play really well, the best I've seen them for a long time, there was pace and energy in the team, the players they've bought have got something… but that's a big jump from 15th to fourth. The manager has still got a lot to prove. I don't see Man Utd that high.",
      "Neville - Nottingham Forest",
      "For Forest to repeat what they did last year would be a massive result for them. That was a massive overreach and overperformance last year. They were punching well above their weight. For Forest to go in again would be a big surprise. They have a lot of very good players, they have a good system of play, an efficient system of play that can win a lot of football matches.",

      "Brentford have been consistent in this league. I don't think Burnley will have enough. Daniel Farke and their owner said Leeds are going to sign players, so they could sign two or three and that could change my mind. Sunderland - I saw something that was beyond just passion, I saw a physicality, a quality to them, a strength. I thought that was a good performance. Maybe this could be the year for Wolves…",

I think Leeds, because of Elland Road, [can stay up]. Am I convinced Wolves are getting relegated? Not really. I think the manager is top. They have lost some big players but the manager is a good manager.",
      "Neville - Brentford",
      "It will be tough for Brentford. If you think of the players they've lost, Yoane Wissa potentially as well. That's eating a lot out of their team. We've loved Brentford for the last few years but this could be their toughest season.",
      "Carragher - West Ham",
      "It wasn't a great end to last season, the team looks slow and old. The lack of legs in midfield really stood out [against Sunderland]. Against a promoted team, to get run over like that the way they did, lose the physical challenges, it's going to be tough.",
      "Carragher - Erling Haaland",
      "Mohamed Salah had arguably his greatest season last season. Certainly on par with his first season. It would be difficult to replicate that. Haaland's the best centre-forward in the Premier League. His numbers are off the scale.",
      "Neville - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "I thought he made some runs and I didn't think he was found at times. I didn't think they played passes into him or crosses to him that suited him. I thought he caused Matthijs de Ligt problems in moments. I think De Ligt had a brilliant game against him and really man-marked him well. I think he'll cause massive issues.",
      "He's what Arsenal need up there. Was he brilliant on Sunday? No. But it's his first game in the Premier League away at Old Trafford. It's hard to come up to Manchester and win and play well. Thierry Henry used to come to Old Trafford and sometimes not get a kick. I think he did alright.",
      "Carragher - Florian Wirtz",
      "It's a deal that is brilliant for the Premier League. How often do we see a player not go to Bayern Munich from the Bundesliga who looks like the top player? For Liverpool to get that deal done was fantastic. He got brought off on Friday and probably wasn't at his absolute best but he still had some silky touches that, when you go and watch him play, there's something there. With Kevin De Bruyne going we needed a superstar to come into that position in the league and I think he might do that.",
      "Carragher - Estevao",
      "He's already got Brazil caps, he was fantastic in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, he looks pretty special. Sometimes I don't feel like there's been that much of an upgrade [with Chelsea signings]. It's almost like swapping for swapping's sake. He's still a young player and isn't the finished article but he was one of them where you think, it won't be too long before he's first choice.",
      "Neville - Adrien Truffert",
      "I was watching Liverpool vs Bournemouth on Friday night - if you were looking at a left-back on the pitch that was the best one, it was the one wearing the Bournemouth shirt. Milos Kerkez looked like he was a little bit rash. His first game at Anfield, so you have to give him time to settle in. Truffert was brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off him.",
      "Neville - Ruben Amorim",
      "There's going to be no in between - if Amorim starts off badly and they're in 13th, 14th in October or November, he's going to be under massive pressure. He has to deliver in these first few months of the season. I think he will perform. All eyes are on him. Amorim has the toughest job in English football, that's why he's one to watch.",
      "Carragher - Oliver Glasner",
      "I think he's a top manager. He plays the same system [as Amorim]. It's very difficult for Crystal Palace to get specialists, a club of that stature. Won the FA Cup, going into Europe, watching them against Chelsea and against Liverpool in the Community Shield, they beat Man City in the FA Cup final… he knows that system inside out. That guy Glasner definitely knows that system right now better than Ruben Amorim.",

      "Arsenal clinched a 1-0 win over Man Utd at Old Trafford thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's goal from a corner but the performance also highlighted the key areas for improvement this season; Viktor Gyokeres struggled to make an impact on his debut",
      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",
      "\"I am happy with the three goalkeepers.\"",
      "\"But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.\"",
      "Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: \"If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.",
      "\"I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…\"",
      "That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.",
      "\"The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,\" retorted Keane.",
      "\"The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,\" hit back Richards. \"There's a lot of chaos going on.\"",
      "Keane had the final word, adding: \"This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.\"",

      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",
      "A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
      "If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter",
