      "Ruben Amorim has insisted that Kobbie Mainoo is the 'future of Manchester United' - and made it clear that he's unlikely to depart in January. Mainoo, 20, has been heavily linked with a move away, having pushed to leave United on loan in the final days of the summer transfer window.",
      "European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich hold an interest but despite not giving him a single start in the Premier League this season, Amorim views him as part of his long-term plans. It comes just a week after the Red Devils boss told Mainoo that he needs to 'fight for his job' before a calf injury ruled him out of last Sunday's 2-1 defeat away to Aston Villa.",
      "\"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling,\" Amorim declared. \"He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "The United manager added: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim then played down the chances of Mainoo leaving Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "Mainoo will miss the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle because of his injury. The timing is especially frustrating given that Bruno Fernandes is also sidelined and Casemiro missed the Villa game through suspension.",
      "This season, Mainoo has only started one match. That was United's humiliating loss against League Two side Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August.",
      "Also in his pre-Newcastle press conference, Amorim confirmed that no decisions have been made regarding the futures of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, who are both out of contract in June. \"There is no decision,\" the Portuguese added.",
      "\"We have a lot to do and we need to understand what is going to happen the next season, because we need to understand if there is European games what we are doing. We have so much to do in this moment. We are not thinking about that. I am really happy with them but I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andreas Pereira confessed that he deliberately avoided speaking with Erik ten Hag before leaving Manchester United to avoid being persuaded to stay. The Brazilian midfielder, currently starring at Palmeiras, made the switch from PSV's youth setup for the opportunity to work under legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "At that time, Ten Hag served as assistant manager at the Dutch club and made considerable efforts to keep the promising youngster. Pereira ultimately made the move to Old Trafford in 2014 and made his senior bow that same year in a League Cup clash against MK Dons.",
      "Despite an eight-year association with Manchester, the midfielder managed just 75 appearances and had loan spells at four separate clubs. Following his final temporary stint at Flamengo in 2021, Pereira felt it was time for a fresh start and was poised to join Fulham for approximately £10million.",
      "However, the midfielder chose to ignore then-United manager Ten Hag due to a previous encounter with the boss at his former youth club. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, the Brazilian confessed he felt unwanted during his Manchester tenure.",
      "Pereira said: \"This was when I came back to England [after my loan]. Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team.' But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United.'",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here. You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad.' That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "Reflecting on his choice to leave Old Trafford, the now 29-year-old said: \"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after Covid, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining [Everton] and suddenly my father called me and said, 'Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you're Brazilian.'",
      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn't feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football. Everyone at United said, 'You're crazy, you'll stay in Brazil, you'll never come back to Europe.'\"",
      "These days, Pereira plays his football in his homeland of Brazil and has featured 20 times this season for Palmeiras - scoring two goals and providing one assist.",

      "Morgan Rogers has been named as Manchester United's 'dream signing' ahead of the January transfer window. Rogers, 23, is in the form of his life and continued his purple patch during Aston Villa's 2-1 win at home to United last Sunday.",
      "The England international scored both of Villa's goals; the first a wonderful curling effort from distance while the second was a similar finish from closer range. The victory made it 10 in a row for title hopefuls Villa and, after Bruno Fernandes went off injured, showed Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim the kind of player that he's missing.",
      "That's the verdict of former United striker Louis Saha, who wants United to make an ambitious bid for Rogers. \"In January, I see a need for a replacement who can spark our midfield creativity,\" Saha told FootItalia.",
      "\"In addition to Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, there's a need for speed in the creativity there. I think Conor Gallagher would've been a good signing, he has the legs and the power, I'd also love to see Morgan Rogers at United.",
      "\"He definitely has this power, he reminds me a bit of Joelinton. That kind of power, and still very technical, and able to go forward. Having that kind of presence in the midfield is so important.",
      "\"I see Rogers as being able to actually bomb forward, but also get pressed and keep the ball, giving time for other players to move into different positions. He is the type of player United need.\"",
      "\"It's a very interesting profile that's rare in the sense that a lot of players are very athletic, but in terms of making the right choice with that athleticism, that's not easy. So I can see Rogers as being a dream signing.\"",
      "Notably, Rogers has a connection with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, from their time at Manchester City. Wilcox was running City's academy when they paid £4.3million to sign a 16-year-old Rogers from West Bromwich Albion in 2019, so the forward will be no stranger to the United hierarchy.",
      "Various City academy graduates are flourishing in the Premier League, the most prominent being Cole Palmer. United would no-doubt love to reap the rewards of their rivals' oversight but if anyone comes knocking for Rogers, Villa will drive a hard bargain.",
      "\"Morgan Rogers is performing fantastically, but he has started the season not getting (goalscoring) numbers but playing well,\" Unai Emery said after beating United. \"Always doing his task, always with the commitment he's showing, with the attitude he has, played each match.",
      "\"Today he did the same and scored goals, of course. He is the protagonist. I'm so, so happy because he's a fighter. He's a good guy, very good guy. His commitment with Aston Villa is massive, and his attitude every day is really fantastic. And when he's getting numbers like today, of course we are very proud of everybody, but especially today with him.\"",

I put him in touch with people I used to work with.\"",
      "Saha scored 42 goals in 124 games, even though his time at United was blighted by injuries. By the time he hung up his boots in 2013 at the age of 35, Saha had played for Metz, Newcastle, Everton, Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland and Lazio.",

      "Scott McTominay is reportedly considering a return to the Premier League, although Manchester United are not necessarily on his radar.",
      "The Scotland international has seen a resurgence in his career since leaving United in 2024, netting 12 goals and clinching the Serie A title in his debut season. The 29-year-old has been a key player for both club and country, often scoring crucial last-minute goals.",
      "However, according to The Sun, this season has seen some challenges for Napoli. An insider revealed: \"Scott loves elements of Italian life and had a wonderful first season.",
      "\"But the passion of the fans can be a blessing, but also make things difficult. He is treated as a god over there, but it means he finds it difficult to do simple things when he's not training. The attention can be suffocating.\"",
      "In light of this, speculation has been rife linking McTominay with various clubs, including Barcelona, Tottenham and Newcastle. The midfielder is reportedly open to a return to England and might even consider a reunion with United if the circumstances align.",
      "Chatting to the BBC last summer about his new Italian adventure, McTominay enthused: \"The people in Naples are incredible, they're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation and that inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care.",
      "\"It's different, a totally different way of life over there - the way you eat, the way you live and all that. It gives you more mental strength. I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.",
      "\"Now, living 1,500 miles away, I can't just pop home to see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different, but in life you sometimes have to step out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.",
      "\"I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?\"",
      "These sentiments of stretching his boundaries might suggest that McTominay is open to testing himself in a foreign league, and with recent rumours linking him to Barcelona, he could potentially join former teammate Marcus Rashford in Spain.",

      "The 28-year-old forward joined the Spanish heavyweights on a season-long spell during this summer's transfer window. That move materialised after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim, with limited game time at United leading to a stint at Aston Villa.",
      "There are now suggestions from other sources that financially troubled Barcelona could make Rashford's move permanent for a fee in the region of £26million. On Christmas Day, reporter Matteo Moretto claimed that Hansi Flick has not only made Rashford a primary target for the Catalan club, but that they are also actively working on making his deal permanent.",
      "Rashford has been under the spotlight since his move to La Liga, following a dip in form at Old Trafford, despite having established himself as a key player for United. Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has scored seven goals and provided eight assists in his first 24 appearances, with four of those goals coming in the Champions League.",
      "The 28-year-old recently expressed his ambition to win trophies with Barcelona and his desire to continue his career in Catalonia. He told SPORT in an interview: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city.",

      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "Rashford continued: \"There is pressure here, but it is not a negative pressure. It's the one you want as a player, the one I want and have always wanted as a footballer.",

      "Sir David Beckham was among the throngs of supportive celebs to reach out to Luke Littler following his World Darts Championship win. And the contents showcased the Manchester United icon's caring side away from the spotlight.",
      "Littler, 18, has transformed the face of darts during his two years playing on the PDC circuit. And he was only too aware of his impact after an England great like Beckham got in touch to congratulate him on his maiden world title almost 12 months ago.",
      "The incident will have been particularly surreal for Littler considering he's a United fan with a deep appreciation of Beckham's legacy. 'Golden Balls' was hardly alone in sending 'The Nuke' well wishes upon clinching the crown at Alexandra Palace, but he may have been up there with the most meaningful.",
      "The teenager continued: \"It goes to show what I have done for the sport, not only for myself but for the other hundreds of professionals out there. Just to see the likes of David Beckham watching it feels crazy.\"",
      "Littler also revealed Beckham contacted him in the build-up to his first final in January 2024, saying: \"Before the final he sent me a message saying, 'Good luck, Luke - once a Red, always a Red.' That was class.\"",
      "That number grew to 4.8m people when including NOW TV viewers and others streaming the event. That represented a 143 per cent increase on the previous year, underlining the influence Littler brought with him.",
      "It's no coincidence the PDC has since made the decision to inflate the prize money on offer at Alexandra Palace since then. This year saw the total prize pot double to £5m, with £1m of that going to the champion, up from £500,000 in previous years.",
      "So Littler isn't the only one in the darts economy benefiting from the extra eyeballs he brings. Indeed, every player who manages to punch a ticket to the World Championship has won before even throwing a dart.",
      "The Nuke has sailed through to the third round of this year's competition almost without even breaking a sweat. He beat Darius Labanauskas in the first round before eliminating David Davies, albeit with some shaky moments against the latter.",
      "Davies had a chance to take the first set before fluffing his lines in the crucial moment. Littler seized upon the opportunity to win 3-0 again and will now face Mensur Suljovic in the next round on Saturday.",
      "There's an aura around Littler now that means a second straight World Championship wouldn't bring the same sense of surprise. Nonetheless, he may well look forward to see which celebrities reach out in the event he successfully defends his crown.",

      "Several senior players in the Manchester United dressing room have felt the full force of Ruben Amorim's anger since his arrival at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have experienced a mixed campaign thus far, with victories over Liverpool and Crystal Palace standing out as bright spots for the club.",
      "Yet defeats against Everton, Brentford and Manchester City have prompted Amorim to single out certain players for criticism, something he has shown no hesitation in doing since taking the reins. Club captain Bruno Fernandes was among those to face the Portuguese manager's fury early in his spell, following his dismissal in a 2-0 defeat to Wolves last season.",
      "The midfielder picked up a second booking and was sent off in the second half, prompting Amorim to highlight the problems caused by the red card. He said: \"It's so tough to win games in this league with 11 men. With 10 men, it's more difficult. So we have to focus on that.\"",
      "Reports also suggested that the boss deliberately blanked his skipper as he trudged off the pitch. Nevertheless, Amorim acknowledged that Fernandes was equally disappointed by the dismissal.",
      "He said: \"I am always frustrated with the red card, but it can happen as he always want to go for the ball. It is not like he wants to stop the player with a yellow. He wanted to go for the ball, the guy got there first and there is a contact and that thing is tough on him also.\"",
      "This season, Patrick Dorgu, Matheus Cunha and Leny Yoro have all felt the force of Amorim's frustration. Most recently, the manager took issue with defender Yoro after he gave away a penalty against Crystal Palace in November, accusing the youngster of overthinking.",
      "Pointing to the French defender's age, Amorim said: \"Of course, I also spoke with him because he thinks too much. He makes the mistakes in the game and then he struggles because he's too young and he wants to do everything so well. And he's growing.",
      "\"He's growing in one moment that everyone here is growing with games, with setbacks, so it's not easy for him as a young guy. And of course, he cannot give that to the people, the way he came to the bench. So, he understands that, but he was really frustrated.\"",
      "He added: \"On the good side, it shows that he cares and he was knowing that was not the best game, but he did some things well, and I show him that also, so he's fit and ready for the next challenge.\"",
      "Fellow defender Dorgu hasn't escaped Amorim's criticism either, with the boss highlighting the full-back's 'anxiety' after the international break. The Danish star had impressed for his nation during their World Cup qualifying campaign, netting the equaliser against Scotland in a crucial encounter.",
      "Despite the 4-2 defeat, Amorim spotted Dorgu's talent but admitted feeling anxious watching the youngster perform. Following United's 1-0 defeat to Everton earlier in November, the 40-year-old said: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland.",
      "\"He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Summer signing Cunha has also experienced Amorim's public criticism this season. The Brazilian, who arrived in June for £62.5million, struggled initially to find the net in United colours.",
      "His breakthrough moment came against Brighton in October, when he scored in a 4-2 victory for the Red Devils at Old Trafford. However, Amorim emphasised at the time that the forward needed to prioritise the team performance over personal statistics.",
      "When Cunha was restored to the starting lineup for United's stalemate with West Ham earlier in December, Amorim said: \"I think he has more levels to go. He is in a different club, different pressure, but I think he copes with that really well.",
      "\"He was struggling because he was not scoring and he was thinking too much about the numbers. The influence that he has in the team is so important for us, but I think Cunha has so much to grow defensively and offensively.\"",
      "Whilst Amorim isn't shy about criticising his players throughout the campaign, it's evident that this approach is balanced with compassion and a genuine desire to see his squad flourish.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believed that Alejandro Garnacho didn't have \"the best attitude\" during his time at Manchester United. The 21-year-old winger secured a switch to Premier League rivals Chelsea during the summer after a bitter falling-out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Argentinian found himself in the manager's bad books after publicly criticising his lack of playing time in the Europa League final, effectively dismissing the Portuguese boss's tactical approach. However, it wasn't only the boss who Garnacho rubbed up the wrong way, as club skipper Fernandes questioned the youngster's mindset while he was still at Old Trafford.",
      "After the winger netted the winning goal in a Europa League encounter against Real Sociedad in 2022, the midfielder didn't hold back with his assessment of Garnacho. Fernandes said: \"He was good but he knows we expect a lot from him.",
      "\"He's still really young, doing really well. At the beginning of the season, he was not at his best. On the [pre-season] tour he did not have the best attitude.",
      "\"That's why he didn't get his chance until now. He's getting his chances because he's training better, he's having the correct attitude.\"",

      "Seasoned players, including Casemiro and Harry Maguire, were amongst those who tried to mentor Garnacho, though their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful.",
      "Following United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, Garnacho said: \"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "He also criticised the club's Premier League campaign, adding: \"Obviously it's hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more.\"",
      "The Athletic reports that Amorim was furious and told Garnacho: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer,\" during a training ground exchange before their final match against Aston Villa.",
      "After his £40million transfer to the Blues in the summer, the 21-year-old was swift to express gratitude to the club and its fans for his time in Manchester. He said: \"Dear Mánchester. After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my teammates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had. I leave proud of what we achieved together and excited for what's to come. Wishing the club nothing but success for the future, while I look forward to giving my all in the next chapter of my career.\"",
      "Since his move to Stamford Bridge, Garnacho has yet to fully demonstrate his true potential for his new team, netting once and providing two assists in the league. Across all competitions, the Argentinian has made 13 appearances in total, scoring just twice, with his other goal coming in a 2-2 stalemate against Qarabag in the Champions League.",

      "Amorim's decision prompted Onana to leave on a temporary basis, but it could now become permanent. \"I'm very happy, trust me. I'm living the best period of my life. I can't complain, I'm very happy to be here,\" the Cameroonian said.",
      "\"Sometimes I'm driving and a car cuts in front of me. 'Onana, stop, I want a photo.' I think to myself, 'Yes, but we can do this in another way.' But when they see me, they're happy, and so am I. It was difficult at first, but now I understand.",
      "\"They are my men, I love them, and I love this feeling. Because they are very passionate. It's a wonderful thing. It's something you can't describe if you're not here.",
      "\"But the time I've spent here has been perfect for me. I'm happy to be here. It's a different lifestyle, but it's great. Truly incredible, amazing.\"",
      "Onana has played all 13 Super Lig matches since coming into the team. Trabzonspor are currently third in the table, seven points behind leaders Galatasaray and four behind second-placed Fenerbahce.",
      "Although the former Ajax star has impressed, manager Fatih Tekke is concerned about how many risks he takes on the ball. Speaking to 61Saat, Tekke revealed: \"I have been warning Andre for two weeks; he is someone we like, and he knows this.",
      "\"He is one of the best when the ball is at his feet, but football requires immense attention. Moments are critical. Last week, he made two risky moves. He can break down the opponent, but a single mistake could have led to a very different outcome today.\"",
      "Trabzonspor president Ertugrul Dogan is also a big fan. \"As soon as he landed on Trabzon with his family, it was clear to us that he was a professional, and comfortable to play here. He shows true character,\" Dogan told HT Spor.",
      "\"Our young goalkeepers are very happy to have him here, After every training, he is almost giving them a private lesson, and he is not doing it because he was asked to, but because it is his character to do so.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's options seem to be limited as the January transfer window approaches, but Manchester United are still in a position to compete in the market. With Africa Cup of Nations commitments and injuries already taking their toll on the squad, a shake-up could be beneficial.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' recent injury is likely to result in the longest absence he's had since moving to England nearly six years ago. This is compounded by the absences of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are all currently competing in Morocco.",
      "While this may not be the happy ending many envisaged for Rashford at United, it could alleviate a lot of pressure for the club. With his ties in Manchester seemingly irreparable, a swift resolution would be a positive outcome at this point.",
      "Rashford's value is high due to his impressive form at Barcelona, who have the option to secure a bargain £28million deal for the forward. Despite their financial difficulties, it's still within the Spanish powerhouse's means to afford such a fee, although it may be optimistic to expect a deal to be finalised this far ahead of schedule.",
      "Clearing Rashford's hefty £300,000-a-week salary from the payroll would be a significant relief for United's board, even if Barca are footing the bill during his loan spell. This would equate to a saving of around £16m over the remaining two years of Rashford's contract, excluding any transfer fee.",
      "If Barca were to decide Rashford had earned a permanent move as soon as next month, it would provide United with an immediate cash boost to reinvest. And the amount would be appreciated following a summer of heavy expenditure.",
      "Securing established stars in the winter is always challenging, but Conor Gallagher presents an enticing prospect. Not only does the ex-Chelsea player have the potential to break into the starting XI, but he also fits the profile of player United currently need and could be available in January, possibly via an initial loan deal.",
      "After an impressive debut season at Atletico Madrid, Gallagher has fallen out of favour under Diego Simeone. He's only made eight starts in all competitions during the first half of the season, with suggestions a fee of around £26m could secure his departure from Spain.",
      "A versatile midfielder who can fill various roles, Gallagher would certainly ease the burden during Fernandes' absence. And with rumours once again circulating that the United captain could depart next year, signing a replacement now would demonstrate excellent foresight.",
      "The only drawback to bringing Gallagher on board is that it could further hinder the opportunities for Kobbie Mainoo to get game time. However, it seems increasingly likely Amorim doesn't have immediate plans to promote the academy graduate in any case.",
      "Despite the summer signings of Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, United's attacking options still appear somewhat thin. Sesko's recent injury exposed a worrying lack of depth in the forward line, a gap that Joshua Zirkzee and Cunha haven't quite managed to fill in recent weeks.",
      "Koln gem Said El Mala isn't a natural frontman, and Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1 formation doesn't necessarily accommodate wingers of his variety. However, at 19 years old, the right manager could shape him into a formidable threat in a modified role, and his age profile would mean the manager could bide his time developing the player.",
      "El Mala's 6'2\" stature may seem awkward out wide, but he has been used as a centre forward by Koln on occasion. The teenager has netted six goals and provided three assists in just 15 Bundesliga appearances this season, showing a natural goal-scoring instinct that could flourish if nurtured at Old Trafford.",
      "Once again, United would be wise to act swiftly as Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester City and Tottenham are among the clubs vying for his signature. His signing could come with a hefty price tag given he's contracted at Koln until 2030, but El Mala may be the kind of talent who becomes a key figure at the club for years to come.",

      "Manchester United's transfer plans may need a rethink after their long-standing target Carlos Baleba seemed to sustain an injury.",
      "The Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder has been on United's radar for some time. It was thought that Ruben Amorim's side were contemplating making a move during the summer transfer window, but the deal proved too costly, especially after shelling out over £200million on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, during Cameroon's Africa Cup of Nations match against Gabon, Baleba appeared to pull his hamstring and had to leave the pitch. If he has indeed suffered an injury, it could scupper any potential move in the upcoming January transfer window.",
      "Given this development, the Mirror have identified 12 other midfielders who could be perfect fits for Amorim's squad.",
      "The former Chelsea vice-captain would bring energy and tenacity to Amorim's midfield, something which has often been found wanting. Moreover, with a price-tag understood to be around £35m, he'd be cost effective",
      "The Bournemouth midfielder has recently been linked with United. His footwork is excellent and he has the energy to get up and down the pitch. Given his age and his contract not expiring until 2028, he would be expensive",
      "Stanislav Lobotka's future at Napoli was uncertain last summer, but the Slovakian stayed put. Having only started eight Serie A matches this season, he may like the idea of a fresh start",
      "The Crystal Palace midfielder is likely United's dream transfer, but with a price-tag understood to be at least £100m, it may take club record transfer to sign him",
      "It's not a transfer window if Goretzka has not been linked with a move to Old Trafford. However, with his contract expiring next summer, now may be the time to sign the Bayern Munich midfielder on the cheap",
      "Anderson has established himself as one of the best all-round midfielders in the country and will likely start for England in the World Cup. He looks more than capable of playing for a club as big as United",
      "Hjulmand was also linked with a move to United in the summer and having worked with Amorim at Sporting, he would arrive knowing exactly what the United boss wants",
      "His deal at Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal expires next summer, which means he could be a bargain waiting in the rings. The Portugal international would bring invaluable leadership, energy and calm to a midfield which can get flustered",
      "Angelo Stiller is understood to have been on United's radar in the past, if he isn't already. He has an outstanding reputation as one of the Bundesliga's most consistent midfielders",
      "The Atalanta midfielder's agent recently suggested he could be available for between €30m-€40m (£26.2m-£34.9m). Given his reputation last season, this could be an amazing move for Amorim",
      "Spanish midfield prospect Javi Guerra was linked with United in the summer. With Valencia struggling on and off the pitch this year, he may be available for a cut price in January",
      "Timber has recently been linked with Brentford and West Ham, but given the fact his contract with Feyenoord expires in 2026 and he has eight international caps for the Netherlands, he could be a cost-effective option for the Reds",

City are poised to activate Semenyo's £65million release clause and leave the likes of United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham defeated in their efforts to sign him.",

      "\"Maybe I should be different like so many managers, but that is my thinking and I think it's the thinking of the board that we cannot do the same mistakes that we did in the past and we need to survive these moments because we have players coming from international [teams] and from Europe.\"",
      "Amorim doesn't need much time to work out if a target is right for his team, adding: \"I think I have a good feeling on that. That's why we will not bring in a player that has that feeling face-to-face.",
      "\"They can mislead me a little bit, but it's going to be hard, so I have the feeling and most of the time, I get it right. I just look at the guy, maybe it's the way they speak and I think I can detect the rubbish. I don't know.\"",
      "As for outgoings, one player who could finalise a departure from United in January is Andre Onana.

      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and could request to leave again in the January window when he returns from the sidelines. However, Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa and United's midfield options will be lighter during his absence.",

We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",

Casemiro, 33, has enjoyed a renaissance at Old Trafford, becoming an important player again after a period of not starting games under Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian has started 14 games out of a possible 17 in the Premier League this term, leading to speculation that his stay in Manchester could be extended beyond the summer. United have the option to extend Casemiro's contract by 12 months, but he is the highest earner in the dressing room and he would continue to earn the same salary if the clause were triggered.",
      "Maguire has made just four starts in the Premier League this season and has not played since picking up a hamstring injury against Tottenham on November 8. There is no option to extend Maguire's deal by 12 months because that option was already triggered by United last year.",
      "When asked whether Amorim had an update on the pair, he said: \"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do. We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing.",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action tonight for the only Boxing Day fixture in the division with Newcastle the visitors to Old Trafford. United will be hoping they can get a win following the defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday. The loss meant the Reds missed the chance to move up to fifth in the table, but due to playing before everyone else this weekend the opportunity is still there.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo for the fixture. Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are also missing but could return next Tuesday against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Casemiro is available having served his one-game suspension.",
      "MEN Sport has asked their United writers to pick their team for tonight's fixture under the lights.",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "United's squad is desperately stretched again and there are very few options available to Amorim to mix things up. There will be a temptation to bring Lisandro Martinez back but it's Leny Yoro's place that is vulnerable and the question has to be whether Martinez can play on the right, so for now that back three remains unchanged.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu are the only available wing-backs. In midfield, it has to be Manuel Ugarte in the deep role and then Casemiro next to him, but it's not a combination that inspires. Newcastle will fancy winning the midfield battle as they so often do against United.",
      "There aren't many attacking options either, so Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko go again. Cunha is at least in magnificent form at the moment.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Martinez was good from off the bench last weekend, but he played in midfield. I would stick with the same back three, although I would make a big change in midfield for this festive game.",
      "Ugarte is well below the standard required and I would give Jack Fletcher a chance to start alongside Casemiro. Ugarte was poor again at Villa Park and we've seen enough of him to suggest he's not at the level required.",
      "Fletcher's cameo was encouraging and it would be exciting to see what he can offer from the start.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "What will be concerning Amorim going into this game is who will be providing the creativity next to Casemiro. That's why moving Mount back should be tempting for United this Boxing Day.",
      "Replacing him in the No.10 role in this scenario would be Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has struggled at United but his better performances have come when he has played in a deeper role and not been asked to lead the line.",
      "Otherwise, it should be the same team that did little wrong at Villa - other than not winning.",

      "Good morning, Manchester United fans and Merry Christmas from us all at the MEN.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are back in action later this evening when they take on Newcastle United at Old Trafford and we're edging closer to the January transfer window opening.",
      "United have made a stark improvement compared to last season and are just outside the Champions League places at the time of writing.",
      "Investment into the squad in January could be make or break for Amorim in their quest to return to European football.",
      "United have been repeatedly linked with January transfer swoops for the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton with central midfield a priority position to address.",
      "A number of players could also depart, with uncertainty around Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club having fallen down the pecking order under Amorim.",
      "We'll have all the latest Man Utd transfer news and speculation in our live blog below.",
      "Renato Bittar has ruled out a potential loan move for his client Diego Leon away from Old Trafford in the January transfer window.",
      "The youngster, who signed for United in the summer, has been linked with a move to Ligue 1 club OGC Nice, who are also owned by Ineos.",
      "However, Bittar expects Leon to remain at Old Trafford for the entire season.",
      "\"We’re always in touch with the club, and Diego León will stay at United for the entire season; he’s not going anywhere,\" he told ABC Cardinal.",
      "\"In my opinion, Diego León should stay at Manchester United. He’s playing for the U21s and alternating as a substitute [on the bench] in the first team.\"",
      "The Athletic claim personal terms will not be a problem between Joshua Zirkzee and AS Roma ahead of a potential loan move to Serie A.",
      "The Dutch forward has struggled for regular game time this season and is said to be keen on a return to Italy in an attempt to bolster his World Cup hops this summer.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Corinthians wonderkid Breno Bido, but reports in Brazil claim a move away from his home country is not likely at present.",
      "The 20-year-old's agent said he'd spoke to several 'big European clubs' but there have not yet been any offers.",
      "Speaking to Globo Esporte, Fernando Brito said: \"From the big European clubs, I don’t know which one I haven’t spoken to. Any club you mention, at some point, we have already had some enquiry, relationship or contact. That doesn’t mean it will turn into a formal offer.",
      "\"The moment for Breno to go to Europe will come. That’s a fact. But we’re in no rush. The great challenge is not going to Europe or making a big sale. The real challenge is sustaining a new project, like we did at Corinthians.\"",
      "Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Sporting have all been touted as possible destinations for the midfielder, who has a release clause of €100m (£87.3m) to foreign clubs, though his agent admits the market will determine his value.",
      "\"The market decides that,\" he said. \"Corinthians will want to raise the price and the buying club will want to lower it. We’re here to balance that.",
      "\"He’s a special kid, with a great heart, humble, and with a lot still to conquer. He’s not only thinking about transfer value.\"",
      "Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have all been linked with a move for Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves.",
      "That's according to Turkish outlet, Sabah, who claim United are in the race to sign the Portuguese international.",

      "The Reds endured a torrid season in 2024-25, but have made a considerable improvement in terms of points tally this season.",

      "Morgan Rogers has been identified as Manchester United's 'dream signing' ahead of the January transfer window. The 23 year old Rogers is enjoying the finest form of his career and maintained his exceptional run during Aston Villa's 2-1 home triumph over United last Sunday.",
      "The England international netted both of Villa's goals; the opener was a magnificent curled strike from range whilst the second came via a similar finish from a closer position. The result extended Villa's winning streak to 10 matches as they chase the title, and following Bruno Fernandes' injury departure, it highlighted to Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim precisely the type of player his squad lacks.",
      "This assessment comes from former United forward Louis Saha, who believes the club should launch an ambitious pursuit of Rogers. Speaking to FootItalia, Saha said: \"In January, I see a need for a replacement who can spark our midfield creativity,\".",
      "\"In addition to Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, there's a need for speed in the creativity there. I think Conor Gallagher would've been a good signing, he has the legs and the power, I'd also love to see Morgan Rogers at United.",
      "\"He definitely has this power, he reminds me a bit of Joelinton. That kind of power, and still very technical, and able to go forward. Having that kind of presence in the midfield is so important.\", he told",
      "\"I see Rogers as being able to actually bomb forward, but also get pressed and keep the ball, giving time for other players to move into different positions. He is the type of player United need.",
      "\"It's a very interesting profile that's rare in the sense that a lot of players are very athletic, but in terms of making the right choice with that athleticism, that's not easy. So I can see Rogers as being a dream signing.\"",
      "Significantly, Rogers shares a history with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, dating back to their Manchester City days. Wilcox was overseeing City's academy when they splashed out £4.3million to secure the services of a 16 year old Rogers from West Bromwich Albion in 2019, meaning the forward will already be familiar with key figures in the United setup.",
      "Numerous City academy products are thriving across the Premier League, with Cole Palmer being the standout example. United would undoubtedly relish the opportunity to benefit from their rivals' misjudgement, but any club pursuing Rogers will find Villa demanding a steep price.",
      "\"Morgan Rogers is performing fantastically, but he has started the season not getting (goalscoring) numbers but playing well,\" Unai Emery said after beating United. \"Always doing his task, always with the commitment he's showing, with the attitude he has, played each match.",
      "\"Today he did the same and scored goals, of course. He is the protagonist. I'm so, so happy because he's a fighter. He's a good guy, very good guy. His commitment with Aston Villa is massive, and his attitude every day is really fantastic. And when he's getting numbers like today, of course we are very proud of everybody, but especially today with him.\"",

      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo is likely to be the talk of the January transfer window with the Premier League's top clubs all vying for his signature next month. On New Year's Day, a release clause of £65m will go live for a limited time and both Manchester United and Manchester City are weighing up activating it.",
      "Semenyo has scored eight goals and bagged three assists this season and while he could be available in the summer, no team looks willing to take this risk. Reports suggest City are Semenyo's preferred destination but United are not thought to be out of the running.",
      "The 25-year-old is the latest star player ready to make a move to a top club but exactly who that will be remains to be seen. So with Semenyo's future firmly in the balance, MEN Sport has asked United and City writers Tyrone Marshall and Simon Bajkowski for the state of play at the Manchester clubs surrounding Semenyo and transfers.",
      "Can they afford it?",
      "Yes. United’s financial situation is much improved from a year ago and they are now more comfortable with their compliance with Profit and Sustainability rules, which are coming to an end anyway. They spent more than expected in the summer and much of it was on what United saw as favourable payment terms, so they can make this deal happen, especially as it was a move they had planned for the summer anyway.",
      "Would he want to go to United ahead of other Premier League clubs in the Champions League?",
      "United feel they are in with a chance so the indications are he is open to it. They aren’t making smooth progress towards qualifying next season either but you feel that it is there for them if they can put the pedal down. There is still an attraction to playing for this club, despite what has happened in the last few years.",
      "Does he fit into Ruben Amorim's rigid system as another 10 or wing-back?",
      "I think he fits in as both and that will be a big attraction to United. If everyone is fit and available, I would expect him to get in the team as a left wing-back, with Amad on the right and Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as the No.10s.",
      "That would give United significant firepower and a much more attacking outlook. But Semenyo can play on both flanks and through the middle and the fact he could cover so many of those positions in Amorim’s system makes him doubly attractive.",
      "Who is he an upgrade on?",
      "As a left wing-back, he is an upgrade on everyone. Diogo Dalot has done a respectable job there and Patrick Dorgu looked better at Villa Park, but it is still a problem position. Semenyo could fill it. And as an option as another No.10 he is clearly better than Joshua Zirkzee as well. He would be a major upgrade at left wing-back and as the third or fourth No.10.",
      "Where does Semenyo fit among all the attacking options?",
      "Semenyo is a wide option in a team that is not flush with them. Pep Guardiola has moved away from using his wingers really this season, even moving Jeremy Doku inside. Semenyo can play on either flank and so could give City extra options of playing but at the same time he will also be expected to add extra dimensions to his game.",
      "Who is he an upgrade on?",
      "In terms of the current squad, he would definitely move ahead of Oscar Bobb. The Norwegian hasn't recovered from the leg fracture that robbed him of a breakthrough at the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, so is looking vulnerable in the January window. Semenyo would also be expected to challenge with Savinho - who he has outperformed this season with Bournemouth - and Doku for a place in the team.",
      "What does Guardiola like in Semenyo that's similar to past successful City players?",
      "More than anything with a January signing, you want somebody who can fit straight into the team. Semenyo is a bit different in the sense he's only moving in January because of opportunity for him and Bournemouth, but the fact he is Premier League proven is perfect for a manager looking to make sure he has a squad capable of going far in all competitions.",
      "Semenyo has shown he's versatile and can play in different systems so there is plenty to like.",
      "Simon is the MEN's Chief Manchester City Writer. He joined the MEN sport desk in 2013 and has covered City home and away since 2016, reporting on Pep Guardiola's time at the club.",

      "Eddie Howe believes that the criticism of £55million signing Anthony Elanga has been too quick off the mark this season. The winger, who joined from Nottingham Forest, has only sporadically displayed the brilliance he demonstrated at the City Ground and is yet to find the back of the net for Newcastle United.",
      "Despite providing just one Premier League assist and setting up a single goal in the Champions League, Howe is confident that Elanga will make a significant impact in 2026.",
      "During Saturday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, Elanga carved open the opposition defence but chose to shoot instead of passing to a team-mate at the Gallowgate End. This decision led to a video of the incident going viral on social media, but Howe doesn't believe this accurately represents the former Manchester United player's abilities.",
      "Per Chronicle Live, Howe said: \"With Anth, it is really strange. If you put all of his best moments together in a Newcastle shirt, you'd see a showreel of a player who has some unbelievable attributes, and he's done some really, really good things for the team.",
      "\"Even the moment on Saturday (vs Chelsea), not many other players would have been able to elevate themselves into that position because they would not have his speed or athleticism to get there in the first place.\", reports Chronicle Live.",
      "\"So I think sometimes we are very quick to analyse things negatively rather than the positive.",
      "\"Yes, the end part was just slightly missing.",
      "\"I think that has been the thing that has held Anthony back from getting the recognition he deserves.\"",
      "Howe has expressed confidence in Elanga's potential to shine in the new year, believing that once he's fully acclimated to his new club, he'll regain the form he demonstrated at Nottingham Forest.",
      "He stated: \"I think better things are to come in the future from him. The end product, goals and assists you know that he will want, we will want from him.",
      "\"But it is there, and the tools are there.",
      "\"A lot of it comes with feeling and confidence and the belonging aspect.",
      "\"When you come to Newcastle or a new club the quicker you can feel all of those things the better time you will have.",
      "\"So I really believe in him and that has never wavered from me.",
      "\"I see the professional he is and how hard he works behind the scenes, and how well he wants to do, he is one of our best trainers every single day.",
      "\"When you put all those things together then I believe really strongly will have a great time.\"",
      "Elanga looks set to play a part on Boxing Day when Newcastle visit Old Trafford.",

Fernandes started against Aston Villa last weekend, but he was brought off at half-time after holding his hamstring. Mainoo was absent from the squad in Birmingham after picking up an injury in training.",
      "Amorim confirmed Fernandes had suffered a muscle injury following the Villa defeat, but the United boss provided a further team news update during his Christmas Eve press conference. Speaking about Fernandes and Mainoo, he said: \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno.\"",
      "When asked when Fernandes would return, Amorim responded: \"I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see.\" Amorim was asked about filling the void and said: \"We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.\"",
      "Fernandes has only missed two United matches due to injury during his time at Old Trafford. The midfielder's other enforced absence was due to illness against Tottenham in March 2022. Harry Maguire has not played since picking up a hamstring injury against Tottenham Hotspur on November 8, while Matthijs de Ligt last played against Crystal Palace on November 30 due to a back injury.",

Fernandes was brought off at half-time against Villa, and he will be unavailable when United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "\"I'm confident we can win any game,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we have some problems, but we need to believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. I believe in the team and believe we can win any game.",
      "\"It's more difficult, but I trust in my players, and if we are really focused, we can win. I think it's impossible to replace Bruno, but I said to the team we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing, that a lot of people need to step up.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"If you see it's not just the creation [from Fernandes], it's every set-piece when the guy is organising sometimes the team, which is a good opportunity for everyone to step up. They need to understand we cannot rely on one player for everything, and sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We have lost Bruno, Amad and Bryan for set-pieces, so this is massive for the team, but it's an opportunity for other players to step up and show leadership in the team.",
      "\"He understands every position on the field, every detail and every set-piece; he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. That is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Martinez] and Luke Shaw, all these guys, we need to step up to have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "United's injuries opened the door for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey to make their debuts against Villa. \"They are normal, they are good kids,\" said Amorim when asked how the pair have reacted.",
      "\"The behaviour they have shown during these weeks is really good, but I don't have that feeling that they are a little bit different because they play for Manchester United. They are really focused, and they are preparing the game. They believe they can play, so that is a good feeling.\"",
      "Amorim was without multiple key players at Villa Park last weekend, but Newcastle have a dismal away record this season. Newcastle won 2-0 at Old Trafford last December, which was a miserable month for Amorim. The Magpies subsequently beat United 4-1 at St. James' Park when the two sides met again in April.",

      "Amorim has challenged Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw to \"step up\" in the dressing room in the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes was brought off at half-time against Villa, and he will be unavailable when United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day. Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo will be unavailable for Manchester United's game against Newcastle due to injury. Fernandes started against Aston Villa last weekend, but he was brought off at half-time after holding his hamstring. Mainoo was absent from the squad in Birmingham after picking up an injury in training. Amorim confirmed Fernandes had suffered a muscle injury following the Villa defeat, but the United boss provided a further team news update during his Christmas Eve press conference. Speaking about Fernandes and Mainoo, he said: \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the press conference. The second part of the press conference is embargoed until 10.30pm this evening.",
      "Everything. Everything because he understands every position on the field. He pays attention to every detail. Every set piece when you have a substitution, he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. But that is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha, Luke Shaw, all these guys. We need to have more leaders to step up because this can happen to Bruno, it is not usual, but this can happen, so it is a big opportunity for the other guys.",
      "It is impossible to replace Bruno but I say that this morning to the team, I think we need to take the good thing if there is a good thing on that, that a lot of people need to step up. It is not just the creation, it is every set piece he is the guy who is organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and understand that we can't rely on one player for everything. Sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We lost Bruno in set pieces we lost Bryan (Mbeumo) in those set pieces so this is massive for the team but it is an opportunity for players to step up and to show the leadership we need in the team.",
      "They are normal, they are good kids. The behaviour they have shown during this week are really good. I don't have the feeling that they were a little bit different because I played them for Manchester United. No, they are really focused, they are preparing for the game and they believe that they can play. That is a good feeling, so nothing different to what I saw in the last few weeks.",
      "I am confident we can win any game. Of course, we have some problems but I believe in the team even without many players in this moment I believe in the team and I believe that we can win any game. Of course, it is more difficult but, again, I trust in my players and if we are really focused in the game, we can win.",
      "No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno. I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see. We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.",
      "We are still working with them [Maguire and De Ligt] They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.",
      "Amorim is here and the press conference will begin shortly...",
      "It won't be long until we hear from Amorim for the final time before Christmas",
      "As we head into Christmas, United are sitting in a better position than they were last year. In 2024, the Reds had 22 points and sat 13th. This year, Amorim's men are up to seventh but more importantly are four points better off. Presuming United do not have a second half of the campaign as bad as last season, the Reds are on track to perform much better this campaign.",
      "We are just less than 30 minutes away from Amorim's press conference. Will the United boss be in the festive spirit this afternoon as he previews Boxing Day?",
      "United would rather not be heading into the January transfer window needing to bring players in. Time and time again we have been told the winter market benefits sellers rather than buyers, but needs must. Despite all the money spent in the summer, United are still lacking options. Amorim knows this and addressed the situation before the trip to Villa Park on Sunday. \"The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United are set to appoint Paul Midgley as their new head of youth recruitment. Midgley has worked in the same role at Newcastle, but he will swap St. James Park for Old Trafford. United have been searching for a new head of academy recruitment since Luke Fedorenko accepted an offer to work for a football agency. Fedorenko played a crucial role in landing top youth signings during his time in Manchester, but he decided it was time for a new chapter after Nick Cox's exit.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "It may be a quieter press conference room than usual due to it being Christmas Eve but there is plenty to discuss prior to Boxing Day. Here's what could be on the agenda:",
      "Ahead of the January transfer window, it appears Rashford is more keen than ever to stay at Barcelona beyond the end of his current loan deal which expires at the culmination of the campaign. Speaking to the media, he said:",
      "Barcelona is a fantastic club, a huge, huge club that is known for winning, and this type of, I want to say pressure, but it’s not a bad type of pressure, it’s a pressure I want to have when playing football. If I’m at a club that doesn’t demand these things, then it’s more difficult for me to be motivated. It’s a fantastic environment for me to continue my football journey. I try to do my best and try to push the team to win, and in the summer, we will see what happens.",
      "Amorim is highly unlikely to want to talk about Rashford in his press conference today.",
      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United. Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like. The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In last week's pre-match press conference, all the build-up surrounded the comments made by Fernandes in an interview with Portuguese media. This time, Fernandes is in the spotlight once more but due to his injury picked up at Villa. There are reports the captain could be out for a month but we should know more when Amorim speaks this afternoon.",
      "Amorim is due to speak to the United media at 1.15pm with the embargo lifting at 1.30pm. We will get the quotes from the press conference as soon as we can after that!",
      "Good morning and welcome along to our Amorim press conference blog on Christmas Eve!",
      "Make sure to stick right here as we build up to the United boss speaking this afternoon. Ahead of the Boxing Day fixture, the Reds have a number of injury issues which need addressing.",
      "Fernandes, Mainoo, Maguire and De Ligt are all expected to be out against Newcastle. The midfield absentees are a huge blow for United and will provide Amorim with a headache over his Christmas dinner.",
      "Stay tuned for all the build-up to Amorim's press conference..."

      "The injury for Fernandes comes as a blow to Man United at the worst possible time, with three game-changers in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all away on international duty with their respective nations for the Africa Cup of Nations over the next month or so.",
      "That has already seen Ruben Amorim dealt a depleted squad, which was evident with his reliance on younger players in the defeat on Sunday.",
      "The loss of Fernandes is a particularly huge blow, considering how crucial he has been to their recent uptick in form, picking up five goals and seven assists from his deeper midfield role.",

      "Mainoo was absent from the defeat at Villa Park, due to a minor injury picked up in training, which meant he couldn't be the immediate Fernandes replacement on Sunday, but could be for Boxing Day's clash with Newcastle United.",
      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",

      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed.

Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",

      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "It has been widely reported that the Red Devils will look to overhaul their midfield in 2026 as they arguably need at least two new players in this department.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd focused on overhauling their attack as they spent over £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also bought Senne Lammens to become their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "These deals have helped to improve Ruben Amorim‘s side, but they are still lacking in certain departments and this is especially the case in midfield.",
      "United were priced out of a move for Carlos Baleba in the summer as they had limited funds, but it has been suggested that they could return for the Brighton star or target Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "READ: Big Christmas Weekend: Chelsea v Aston Villa, Man City, Mason Mount, Thomas Frank",
      "Alternatively, Man Utd could look to sign a cheaper option as a short-term fix in January, with ex-Chelsea star Gallagher mooted as an option.",
      "Now, Romano has revealed that Gallagher is “only” available on a permanent transfer in January.",
      "“The message I am getting from Atletico Madrid on Conor Gallagher is very clear,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Atletico are only open to a permanent transfer, around €30 million. No loan.",
      "“This was the same position in the summer, when Manchester United tried a last-minute move. It was not possible then and it is the same now.",
      "“Sometimes in January things can change late, but as of today, the message is permanent or nothing.”",
      "Baleba would have cost around £100m in the summer, but former Premier League CEO Keith Wyness has explained why he thinks his valuation has “dipped” to around £75m.",
      "“Well, Brighton have been the masters. I mean, we just, we know what they’ve done with Chelsea. They’ve made a lot of money out of Chelsea with either managers or players. And I think they’re in no rush to sell. I think they’ll stick out for the price,” Wyness said.",
      "“Yes, Baleba’s form has dipped because a lot of people think it’s because of all the transfer speculation. I’m not necessarily convinced myself. I think his valuation has dipped, in my opinion, even though Brighton are very good at negotiation.",
      "“I think I would still see him going maybe in the £75m to £80m mark with some type of add-on or bonuses to get it up to make a headline number of close to £100m.",
      "“But I do think that that dip in form will affect his valuation. If he comes back into form in the second part of the season, which he could well do, then of course in the summer they’re going to be looking to keep that sort of £100m mark.",
      "“I think there’s room now to negotiate, and I think Brighton would be prepared to move on. They’ve got their replacements in place as Brighton always seem to have.",
      "“And so I think, yes, I think it’s a chance to make a deal. But they better be quick in January if they’re going to do it, because I think his form may come back from what I’m hearing.”",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Fernandes was brought off at half-time in Sunday’s Premier League match at Aston Villa after suffering a muscle injury.",
      "The Portugal international has only missed two club matches through injury in his professional career, but is set to be absent for around a month.",
      "It’s a huge blow for United, who only know life with their captain in the starting XI. It will be interesting to see how they cope without him. They will either crumble, or, for no reason other than football being very weird at times, look significantly better.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the natural choice to replace Fernandes, but he is also injured.",
      "It’s typical of the young midfielder’s season, which has been stop-start and frustrating. Mainoo knows he is competing against Fernandes for a starting spot rather than alongside him.",
      "Dislodging the United skipper is an impossible task and his injury should have presented the perfect opportunity for Mainoo to finally stake his claim under Amorim.",
      "Instead, the United boss is without both and could move Mason Mount back into midfield to play alongside Casemiro, although centre-back Lisandro Martinez came off the bench to feature there at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution, but you can’t blame him for being a little tentative.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Amorim said: “It’s impossible to replace Bruno. But I said that this morning to the team that we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing in that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "“It’s not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can’t rely on one player for everything.",
      "“Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad [Diallo] on set-pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "“This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw and all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.”",
      "Young midfielder Jack Fletcher, son of United hero Darren, came off the bench against Villa and is one of the options Amorim is considering.",
      "“We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing,” he said.",
      "“I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that’s why, when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "“I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players at this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust my players. If we are really focused on the game, we can win.”",
      "So, who replaces Fernandes in the United midfield?",
      "A Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte pairing seriously lacks creativity and, in the latter’s case, quality.",
      "Ugarte is short on confidence and has struggled every time he has taken to the pitch this season, with most of his appearances coming from the bench.",
      "He started against Villa last weekend and could start again if Amorim believes continuity is required to restore his form.",
      "But with Newcastle looking far less combative and physical in midfield, there is little need to pair the two South Americans.",
      "Fletcher is an option, but it will likely be Mount who starts alongside Casemiro, who returns from suspension to face the Magpies.",
      "Mount has impressed in recent weeks in a more advanced role, but he is perfectly capable of dropping deeper to perform a similar function to Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount’s impact for Manchester United this season 🔴 pic.twitter.com/k9slPwA1FV",
      "He has the engine, tactical awareness and set-piece delivery to do as good a job as any in the middle of the park. It will be a big test, but one he is capable of passing.",
      "Mount could thrive in a starring role rather than a supporting one, and a top performance against Newcastle could put him firmly on England boss Thomas Tuchel’s radar, if he isn’t already.",
      "Mount dropping deeper, combined with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaves question marks over Amorim’s front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is expected to start up front, with Matheus Cunha in behind him. The final attacking spot is up for grabs and will probably go to Joshua Zirkzee, with young striker Chido Obi the only other first-team option.",
      "It is either Casemiro and Ugarte in midfield with Mount, Cunha and Sesko ahead of them, or Casemiro and Mount in midfield with Zirkzee, Cunha and Sesko up front, or Martinez will start as a wildcard.",
      "That is, of course, unless Amorim does the unthinkable and changes formation.",
      "That really would be a Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has commented on Kobbie Mainoo’s future at the Premier League giants as he remains linked with an exit.",
      "Man Utd are one of two Premier League clubs to have made an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior ahead of the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is likely to miss the Red Devils’ next six matches, according to reports, after picking up an injury against Aston Villa.",
      "The Sun bring us the exclusive news that an injured player has a limp, while Antoine Semenyo may have made his decision already.",

      "Boxing Day falling on a Friday may have robbed us of our God-given right as Englishmen to spend the day watching wall-to-wall top-flight football, but it’s still a pretty Big Christmas Weekend, we suppose.",
      "The one game we are being allowed by the wokerati on Boxing Day is at least a good one, and the following couple of days do have some belters to be fair. Including – again, as should be law at this time of year – a couple of potential opportunities to deploy the word ‘sack’ in whimsical fashion to refer to both Santa’s preferred if archaic toy delivery method and the fate of a couple of under-fire managers.",
      "It’s the most wonderful time of the year, all right.",
      "",
      "Always looked like it would be the most significant game in the title race over the festive weekend, but only in the last few weeks has it become clear that this is because of Aston Villa’s involvement and not Chelsea’s.",
      "It is, obviously, a huge test of Villa’s stickability; Chelsea may have meekly surrendered their own chances in self-fulfilling fashion once again, but they remain a tough test for a team trying to compete with two giants in Arsenal and Man City.",
      "The actual dynamic of this Saturday evening affair will inevitably be coloured by what Man City and Arsenal themselves have done earlier in the day. Fair to say Villa would at this point settle for a retention of the status quo in terms of their gap to the top two.",
      "And without wishing to pour any rain on Villa’s current parade, it does still bear mentioning that as the second half of the season pans out there is still the possibility/probability that Chelsea emerge as more significant rivals to Villa than the top two anyway in terms of Champions League qualification.",
      "Villa currently lead Enzo Maresca’s side by seven points and while sprinting to keep up with the top two isn’t doing Unai and the lads any harm right now it does feel like a day where, even for a team with 11 wins from their last 12 Premier League games, a draw would be absolutely fine and not in any way necessarily a momentum killer.",
      "",
      "Villa are obviously the best team in the country right now, but for the first time in a good while it’s looking like Man City might be second best. They’re certainly playing more convincing football than Arsenal right now, and have another chance to briefly leapfrog their main title rivals and put pressure on a potentially ticklish home game for Arsenal against a Brighton side who so often relish the chance to mess with the bigger boys.",
      "But in order to apply that pressure City must take care of their own business against Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest, a team that can’t quite be described as resurgent but is definitely no longer the pushover of the brief but hilarious Angeball days.",
      "They’ve been alternating between victory and defeat for the last six Premier League games, and the bad news for City is that they’ll arrive at the City Ground at the wrong point in that particular pattern.",
      "The good news for City is that they aren’t currently alternating anything having won each of their last five Premier League games, the last three of them by 3-0 margins and with 17 goals in total across those five games. Which, even after the 3-0 paddling of Tottenham the other week, is still the total number of Premier League goals Forest have managed all season.",
      "",
      "We may only have one Premier League game on Boxing Day, because of woke, but it is at least a good one as the tentatively improving Man United take on a frustrating Newcastle side whose season still awaits any kind of real lift-off.",
      "The big news for the home side, of course, is how they fare without Bruno Fernandes. He isn’t the actual most irreplaceable player in the league, because that probably is still just Erling Haaland because of sheer weight of numbers, but his combination of vital importance and until now impeccable reliability does give this some real heft.",
      "This is a player who basically plays all of the football for Man United, and there’s a certain irony that his first vaguely serious injury in five years has come right at the start of the busiest time of the quietest season.",
      "But every crisis is an opportunity, and now for the first time in his United career we get the chance to see Mason Mount cast in a starring rather than supporting role.",
      "For him, the timing does seem rather good. He has in recent weeks been playing the best football he’s produced since leaving Chelsea and has already proved he can do a job playing alongside United’s undisputed star man.",
      "Now he must show he can pull the strings in Bruno’s absence, or all the hints of recovery for both United and Mount himself over the last couple of months could be washed away before January is through.",
      "",
      "The current favourite in the Sack Race takes on the current favourite to replace him as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham travel to Crystal Palace for a real melon-twister of a game.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s departure for somewhere shinier than Palace has long felt inevitable, but it wouldn’t do at all for them to lose him to somewhere as ropey as Spurs. So Palace need to tread carefully here, making sure to win, obviously, but not in such a way as to hasten Frank’s demise.",
      "Luckily, Liverpool have given them the perfect blueprint for how to be alarmingly bad but still beat Spurs.",
      "Frank is, clearly, in very deep trouble. The fallout from that vaguely absurd game against Liverpool in which Spurs played better with 10 men and then better still with nine means he has to try and engineer a result at Selhurst Park without both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero. Both let him down badly on Saturday in inconsistent seasons, and this doesn’t look like a moment in which Spurs or Frank can afford to have both their attack and defence weakened in this manner.",
      "Frank has already survived one encounter with his former club Brentford that had the possibility to end his Tottenham reign. But if he leaves Selhurst Park with the result we suspect, then the New Year trip to his old patch will carry old problems.",
      "There was mitigation and even encouragement from the performance even in defeat against Liverpool, but that won’t fly in the next couple of games. He’s got to find a result in one of these two games surely. And even that may be no more than delaying the now inevitable.",
      "",
      "Unlike the ultra-woke, Christmas-cancelling Premier League, the Football League is delivering a full sack of Boxing Day fixtures to enjoy with your turkey sandwiches, Rennies and hangover.",
      "Couple of tasty ones from the Championship promotion picture, too, with a couple of six-pointers among pairs of teams with their eyes on a play-off finish at worst.",
      "Stoke v Preston is one, with the Potters looking to arrest their recent slide while for Preston the recent issue has been too many draws in a six-match unbeaten run.",
      "The pick, though, looks to be Millwall v Ipswich, because third v sixth with third place up for grabs is always a particularly delicious dynamic for a Championship fixture at any time of the season.",
      "",
      "God bless Serie A for carrying on even though it’s Christmas, and also this season for delivering what looks certain to be the best title race across Europe’s big leagues. We still here have a top five separated by just four points and after a bad couple of weeks for Bologna and Como it does seem now to have crystallised into a scrap between five big guns.",
      "It’s currently all rather neat, with Inter top on 33 points and stacked up at one-point increments behind them come Milan, Napoli, Roma and Juventus.",
      "The Christmas weekend doesn’t pit any of the contenders in direct conflict, but Inter’s trip to Atalanta does look as good a choice as any.",
      "Essentially, absent a clear standout fixture for any of those title contenders, if you’re picking one game Inter are generally the safest bet on the entertainment front. They’ve conceded more goals than anyone else in the top eight bar Juventus (by a single goal) but with 34 goals in their 15 games thus far are 10 goals clear of anyone else."

      "Real Madrid are struggling to get Vinicius Junior to sign a new deal as the Brazil international wants parity with top earner Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The report adds: ‘Faced with this situation, those at the Bernabeu have decided not to remain idle. Real Madrid are already listening to offers and, according to sources close to the club, two very serious proposals have arrived from the Premier League. Chelsea and Manchester United have put more than €100 million on the table to acquire Vinicius this summer, a figure that, at the very least, compels them to sit down and talk.",
      "‘At Real Madrid, there’s no urgency to sell, but there is concern about losing control of the narrative. Letting time pass without renewing Vinicius ‘ contract could become a strategic problem, especially if the player enters the final stretch of his contract without an agreement. Selling now, with strong offers and room to manoeuvre, is starting to look like a logical option.’",
      "There could be conversations about Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes being involved in the deal for Vinicius Junior in the summer with Spanish website Fichajes claiming Real Madrid see the Portugal international as a ‘realistic option’.",
      "It has been revealed that clubs from outside the Premier League can buy Fernandes for €60m as he has a release clause in his contract and ‘that amount fits within Real Madrid’s parameters for a strategic signing’.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘Herein lies the main doubt. Bruno Fernandes is 31 years old, a factor that doesn’t quite convince Florentino Pérez. In recent years, the president has opted for young signings with potential and resale value.",
      "‘However, the club also recognizes the need for balance. Incorporating proven experience can be key to supporting an increasingly young squad in crucial moments.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano clarified Fernandes’ release clause earlier this week, he said: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",

Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "Arsenal sit top of the table at Christmas for the fifth time in the Premier League era; they have never won the title from this position!",
      "Only Liverpool have been top of the Premier League at Christmas more times and failed to get over the line.",
      "They join Manchester United (twice), Newcastle (twice), Norwich, Aston Villa and Leeds United in knowing the pain of getting over-excited over the turkey only to end the season empty handed, and some of those collapses have been rather spectacular.",
      "Here’s 10 of the worst from the past 33 years, including a handful of particularly notable ones from the lower leagues.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – 2003/04 (Premier League)\nUnited at least had the excuse of going up against Arsenal’s Invincibles, but the depth of United’s post-Christmas drop-off was surprising for a Sir Alex Ferguson side nonetheless.",
      "They had lost just three times before Christmas, with a goalless draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford the only time they had shared the spoils, putting them a point ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea on Christmas Day.",
      "But United dropped points more often than they won them from there: their post-Christmas record was W10, D5, L6, with a 4-1 defeat to away to struggling Manchester City particularly painful, especially as it left Fergie’s side with just two wins in eight games. United ended up finishing third, 15 points adrift of unbeaten Arsenal.",
      "",
      "9) Norwich City – 1992/93 (Premier League)\nTitle-less Norwich had also been top on Christmas Day 1988, only to end up finishing third behind Arsenal and Liverpool. Well, this time it was going to be different! Except, erm, no, it wasn’t.",
      "The Canaries learned nothing from the warning they had provided themselves on their previous trip to the coal mine, and in fact their collapse began just before Christmas: they didn’t win any of their six games between their loss at Old Trafford on 12th December and their 1-1 draw at home to Coventry on 16th January.",
      "Mike Walker’s side remained in indifferent mid-table form for the rest of the campaign, bizarrely alternating between impressive victories and crushing high-scoring defeats. Norwich ended up finishing 12 points behind Manchester United in third – and, very weirdly, with a negative goal difference to boot.",
      "",
      "8) Leeds United – 1999/00 (Premier League)\nLeeds were two points clear at top for the last Christmas of the 20th century (yeah, yeah, shut up, ‘the millennium was actually 2001′ pedants, nobody likes you) partly because they had a game in hand over Manchester United, but again , it’s the sheer depths they sank to from there that makes it notable.",
      "After shrugging off early-season defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, David O’Leary’s Leeds had been almost unstoppable. Only Everton and Wimbledon succeeded in getting anything off them in an impressive run up to and including Boxing Day, with Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell particular stars.",
      "But things immediately nosedived after that: Leeds lost four of their next six, including six-pointers against fellow title hopefuls Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Three straight wins in March briefly revived Leeds’ hopes of pushing Ferguson’s men all the way – they had just four points to make up in their last nine games – but they promptly lost four in a row to put themselves dead in the water and ended up third, some 22 points off the pace.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds United – 2018/19 (Championship)\nAnd what a lovely way to segue to the EFL section of our list. It was Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds this time, and again they were one point clear at the top of the second tier on Christmas Day with exactly half the season’s games played. More importantly for their automatic promotion prospects, they were six ahead of third-placed West Brom.",
      "We’re going to resist the temptation to put their decline down to the infamous spygate incident, not least because Leeds actually lost both their last game of 2018 at home to bottom-half Hull and their New Year’s Day fixture away to Nottingham Forest. Yet despite looking far more fragile and, frankly, knackered than in the first half of the season, Leeds remained in the top two. With just four games to go Bielsa’s side were still in second place, three points clear of third-placed Sheffield United.",
      "Their fixture list was extremely inviting, too: encounters against 21st-placed Wigan, 15th-placed Brentford, fifth-placed Aston Villa, and rock-bottom Ipswich. They got a decent point against Villa, but contrived to lose the other three. That meant Leeds finished six points away from automatic promotion; narrative dictated they must then lose to Derby in the play-off semi finals.",
      "",
      "6) Portsmouth – 2020/21 (League One)\nThat season behind closed doors is one we’d all collective like to forget, but nobody more so than Portsmouth. They led an extremely tight third-tier table on Christmas Day on goal difference and having played a game more than second-placed Lincoln City, but their credentials were supported by Pompey having the best record in the division in both the goals for and goals against columns.",
      "But an abysmal run that started with a four-goal defeat at home to Hull in late January saw Portsmouth plummet to 10th by March, costing manager Kenny Jackett his job.",
      "Hopes of a reviving the season just enough to claim a play-off spot were briefly awakened as new appointment Danny Cowley led Pompey to four wins right off the bat, but they won just two more of their remaining eight games and ended up in eighth place, two points shy of the top six.",
      "",
      "5) Huddersfield Town – 1999/00 (Championship, as it wasn’t called then)\nEnglish football’s first three-in-a-row champions had spent 27 years outside the top flight by the time they sat top of the tree for Christmas 1999, thanks in no small part to Marcus Stewart’s superb form in front of goal.",
      "Steve Bruce’s Terriers won just one game in January and February, however, and compounded their slide to fifth place by unexpectedly selling Stewart to fourth-placed Ipswich Town on 1st February.",
      "Stewart would, naturally, score the winner against Huddersfield less than two weeks later, then help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion via the play-offs; Huddersfield weren’t even involved, having finished the season in eighth place. Stewart scored 19 Premier League goals the following season as Ipswich finished a brilliant fifth; Huddersfield were meanwhile relegated to the third tier. So that worked out well.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool – 1996/97 (Premier League)\nAlright then, back to the Premier League from here, we reckon. And again we return to the 1990s, when a lot of the time you could win titles with a points tally in the 70s. Liverpool were well on course for that by Christmas 1996, when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with 2 Become 1 and the Spice Boys were top of the Premier League. Unfortunately for them, 1 Became 4.",
      "It wasn’t any one extended run of especially awful form that did for them – they never went more than two games without a win – but more a general inability to string together a convincing run of victories: they only did so once in the second half the season, in fact, winning three in a row in January-February.",
      "A series of David James blunders was particularly costly for Roy Evans’ side, whose title hopes were effectively killed off by a 3-1 defeat at home to eventual champions Manchester United with just three games left to play. Newcastle and Arsenal snuck in ahead of the Reds on goal difference on the final day, to boot, leaving Liverpool to finish fourth in a two-horse race.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa – 1998/99 (Premier League)\nIt’s always remarkable to look back on Manchester United’s treble-winning season and remember just how easily they could have ended up completely empty-handed. Case in point: it was John Gregory’s Aston Villa, not United, who sat top of the table on Christmas Day that season.",
      "It didn’t last long: Villa were displaced by a defeat away to Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day, returned very briefly by beating Sheffield Wednesday, then never reclaimed top spot as they embarked on a genuinely miserable second half of the season as Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim’s brilliant goalscoring form dried up.",
      "Villa took just 12 points from their final 16 games of the season, with their only three wins in that run all coming in a vain and far-belated burst of late-season form. They were already down to sixth by that point, and three straight losses to finish the season ensured that was where they finished.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – 2013/14 (Premier League)\nAh, god, do we really need to recap this one? It takes such a high position not because Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were miles ahead at Christmas, because they weren’t: they were only top on goal difference and just two points ahead of fifth-placed Everton.",
      "Nor is it because Liverpool were notably awful in the second half of the campaign: they were the joint-second best team in the division from Boxing Day onwards, too, dropping just four points between between game 20 on New Year’s Day and game 35 in mid-April.",
      "But come on. You can’t make any list of title capitulations without including Liverpool 2013/14. This does not slip (which he did). Another Istanbul (which they were on the receiving end of from Crystal Palace). Comedy gold.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – 1995/96 (Premier League)\nA brilliant failure that may never be topped. Ten points. Ten bloody points clear, Newcastle were. Ten points at Christmas. They’d been top of the table since beating Coventry 3-0 on the opening day and would stay there until close to the end of March. In the bag.",
      "Except that having been dodgy as owt going into Christmas, a Manchester United inspired by Eric Cantona’s return from his fan-kicky suspension were virtually flawless after opening their stockings (leave it), winning all but four of their games – starting with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle themselves.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, were very, very flawed, with Faustino Asprilla’s mid-season arrival bringing yet more flair to an already attacking side but leading Kevin Keegan to disastrously change shape to fit him in, while new midfield arrival David Batty failed to help matters.",
      "That famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield in early April was Newcastle’s fourth defeat in six games, and the upturn in their form that followed was too late: Manchester United had overtaken them, and made sure the title was sealed on points rather than goal difference by winning their final two games while Newcastle were only able to draw theirs."

      "Man Utd have ‘made contact’ to sign RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande after Man City won the race to sign Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Semenyo had become a brilliant market opportunity for many clubs with the Bournemouth winger available in January for £65m, due to a release clause in his contract.",
      "But The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealed on Tuesday that Semenyo’s ‘preference is to move to Manchester City in January’ after months of speculation.",
      "It is his ‘desire to win trophies’ that led him to the decision and on Man Utd, Ornstein added: ‘Manchester United also tried their best to sign the forward, but a move in January was always going to be a stretch and the club only wished to bring in players who are eager to join.’",
      "And now a reliable X account has claimed that Man Utd have now ‘made contact’ over a move for RB Leipzig star Diomande as they look to land an alternative to Semenyo.",
      "The account wrote on X: ‘Exclusive. We can confirm that @ManUtd have made contact with RB Leipzig in the last few hours regarding Yan Diomande. Manchester United are big admirers of the player #mufc.’",
      "READ: Ranking Man Utd’s 10 post-Fergie January transfer window signings…",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that Joshua Zirkzee would be more likely to leave Man Utd if they signed Semenyo or another attacker.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “We will see what happens with Semenyo, and this, guys, remember this point, could be an important deal to understand what happens with Joshua Zirkzee.”",
      "Romano continued: “Last week a meeting took place between Roma and the agents of Joshua Zirkzee. This week, Roma have been advancing in the conversations with the camp of Zirkzee.",
      "“Roma are pushing, they want the player and consider him a top priority. The manager of Roma, Gian Piero Gasperini, is pushing to have the player as soon as possible at the beginning of January.",
      "“Man Utd don’t want Zirkzee to leave at the beginning of January because they are short of options with Amad [Diallo] and [Bryan] Mbeumo at AFCON, Bruno [Fernandes] now injured, [Kobbie] Mainoo at the moment still not available.",
      "“So Man Utd at the moment are still not giving the green light. Let’s see the timing and let’s see the official proposal from Roma, what kind of formula it’ll be.",
      "“But on the player side Roma are making some progress. They’re trying to tempt Zirkzee by telling the player something like ‘here, you can be a regular starter, play every game, Italian and European football, you can be the hero of the city of Rome.'”",
      "And now Dutch outlet Voetbal International insists that Roma ‘goes all out’ for Zirkzee in January and the Serie A side ‘want to move quickly’.",
      "The Italian outfit ‘intend to loan Zirkzee for six months, with a mandatory purchase option’ but a quick deal is not guaranteed with Man Utd suffering from injuries to key players and Africa Cup of Nations absentees.",
      "For Zirkzee it’s ‘crucial that he plays plenty of minutes in the next six months’ as he looks to get into the Netherlands squad for the World Cup in North America in the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘Zirkzee has had positive talks with Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini and is enthusiastic about the plans, but the final say lies with Manchester United. It seems the payment structure still needs to be finalized. The player himself has reached an agreement.’",
      "According to reports, Liverpool are trying to fend off competition from Manchester United to sign Yan Diomande from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.",

      "Manchester United often don’t even bother with the January transfer window, perhaps scarred by the memory of their worst signing of the post-Ferguson era. But it also prompted their very best…",
      "United are reported to be in the market for January recruits, though they appear to have missed out on Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If they sign another forward before midfielder, frankly, the club should be folded. But reports suggest they could also be in the market for Ruben Neves. Which, unless he leaves his legs in Saudi, seems like a good idea.",
      "As did most of these January signings. Even this fella at no.10…",
      "",
      "Rated on these pages as the worst of all the post-Fergie signings, which is really quite an achievement when you consider your Di Marias, your Sanchos, your Pogbas. But Sanchez admitted he wanted to quit United and return to Arsenal after only his first training session. Sadly for him and United, there was no return policy on the £35million swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the Gunners.",
      "Then the highest-paid player ever in the Premier League, Sanchez stuck it out for 32 league appearances, scoring three goals while barely hiding his contempt for his surroundings.",
      "In fairness to United, no one saw it going this badly wrong when he was tinkling the ivories for his unveiling video. In Sanchez, they had signed one of the Premier League’s best players. But, even by United standards, the immediate slump in the Chilean’s output once he walked through the Old Trafford door was damning on all concerned. In the end, they had to pay him millions just to f*** off, which was far better value than the millions they paid him to play.",
      "",
      "At Barcelona, Valdes won everything in one of the greatest teams of all time. So it was quite striking to see him as barely a bit-part at United after he signed for 18 months as a freebie for Louis van Gaal in January 2015.",
      "Valdes played two games for United, serving as understudy to compatriot David De Gea before p*ssing off Van Gaal to the extent he wasn’t allowed to train even with the youth team or allowed a locker for his Rolex while he worked out alone with an academy goalkeeping coach.",
      "",
      "Arriving on loan from Palace in January 2023, ex-England stopper Butland was just one of a few odd goalkeeper signings made by United, replacing another in Martin Dubravka. At least Dubravka got his gloves dirty twice. Butland never made it off the bench for the club he supported as a boy, even if he took an FA Cup runners-up medal back to Palace with him.",
      "",
      "The Netherlands international is widely derided on the basis that he failed to score a Premier League goal in his half-season at Old Trafford. Which isn’t a good look for a centre-forward.",
      "But after a loan switch from Burnley, with the Clarets splitting £3million with Besiktas, Weghorst endeared himself to the United faithful just by running around a bit and showing an appetite to be there. That’s how low the bar was for a fanbase fed up of watching Anthony Martial’s mard-arse saunter around Old Trafford.",
      "He scored two cup goals, won the Carabao Cup and generally seemed to relish his big opportunity. But, enthusiastic though he was, he was never likely to be the top-class striker Erik ten Hag needed.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag had to hurriedly spin through his Rolodex during the final days of the January 2023 transfer window as soon as it emerged that Christian Eriksen would be out for three months after bumping into Andy Carroll in a bad mood.",
      "As the first Austrian to play for United, Sabitzer scored three goals in 18 appearances and had a hand in the Carabao Cup triumph by coming off the bench in the final against Newcastle. When his loan was up, everyone concerned seemed pretty non-plussed about the prospect of making it a longer-term arrangement. He did okay but his impact was negligible.",
      "In the end, Sabitzer returned to Bayern Munich before being sold to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "",
      "United’s move for Ighalo in January 2020 sparked a new genre of transfer: an Ighalo-type move, one defined as late, desperate and short-term. See: Weghorst.",
      "In that sense, Ighalo served his purpose. Arriving from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, he bagged five goals in 19 appearances in the Covid season to earn a six-month extension before heading off to Al Shabab to complete the lucrative CSL-Pro League double bubble.",
      "MORE FROM F365: Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle among top 10 storylines we weren’t expecting in 2025",
      "The jury is still out on Dorgu but a year on from his arrival from Lecce, a verdict is surely imminent. Frankly, though, it doesn’t look encouraging. And the slim possibility that he might yet come good means he ranks higher than his performances so far merit.",
      "The Denmark international is still only 21 with less senior experience than many peers of a similar age so it was unfair to expect him to hit the ground running. But it is hard to identify many redeeming features in the left wing-back. He’s quick, sure. But can you recall him giving many opposition full-backs a hard time? There is certainly little encouragement to be found in a record of no goals and three assists in 37 appearances. Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing but wing-backs on both sides are among the areas United are still considered weakest.",
      "",
      "The spectacle of club-record signing Mata being choppered into Carrington to join United in January 2014 summed up the post-Fergie United. Or rather the post-David Gill United. The Woodward United.",
      "Not that any of that was Mata’s fault. And for much of his career at United, the former Spain playmaker was a pleasure to watch. Never more than in March 2015 at Juanfield. And the fact he’s a good egg did him no harm, even if he rarely dragged United to new heights as one might expect of a creative record signing.",
      "Mata spent seven and a half years at Old Trafford, scoring 51 goals in 285 appearances, winning four trophies. Never the big ones, but United haven’t been in a position to be sniffy about silverware.",
      "The Diallo deal was arranged in October 2020 to be completed the following January. And for a while, it looked like more money down the drain when the winger struggled to make a first-team breakthrough. A loan move to Sunderland went much better than an earlier stint at Rangers and eventually, three years after he joined, Amad began to get some regular minutes in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ten Hag was binned, Amad was expected to be one of the players to profit from Amorim’s appointment and the sudden need for wing-backs. Indeed, were it not for an ankle injury last season, he would be in the top three players with most minutes under Amorim. Amad can play as wing-back or as one of the wide forwards. He probably prefers the latter but is needed more as the former.",
      "",
      "Quite simply the best signing of the post-Fergie era, be it the summer or winter window.",
      "Fernandes has been the single consistent bright spot on a rather bleak landscape since he arrived from Sporting Lisbon pre-Covid in 2020. Immediately dismiss the opinion of anyone who pushes the claim that Fernandes has been ‘a problem’, or indeed anything but the best, most creative signing of the last dozen years. Imagine how bad United would have been without him.",
      "It’s not another symbol of Broken Britain but it is sad that there will be only one Premier League game on Boxing Day.",
      "Alexander Isak has *finally* broken his silence on his injury four days ago, but Liverpool need not worry because a perfect replacement has been identified.",
      "There is anger at the notion that Alexander Isak’s leg break was karma and not a lot else in the pre-Christmas Mailbox.",
      "Liverpool’s frustration at Alexander Isak’s injury is obvious and understandable, but there is no villain in this story and no justice to be served.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications."

      "“He’s been the one constant through all their troubles, the one pulling them through games at times. There’s no doubt they’ll miss him massively. He very rarely gets injured, so he’ll be a big miss.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "The Red Devils paid out around £74m to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd spent almost all of their budget on attacking players with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also joining, while Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were the other summer arrivals.",
      "Sesko has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and playing for Man Utd, with the Slovenia international contributing two goals and one assist in 14 matches in all competitions.",
      "And Parker wonders whether Man Utd ever sent any scouts to go and watch Sesko as they are failing to play to the 22-year-old’s strengths.",
      "The former Man Utd defender exclusively told Football365 in association with gambling portal British Gambler: “You look at Benjamin Sesko and the goals he’s scored, it makes me wonder whether Manchester United sent anyone to actually watch him play. When he was at Leipzig, there were lots of balls coming into the box and those big-angle passes being hit at him from deep for him to run onto.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Tottenham freakout, assorted flops – 10 of the 2025 storylines we DID see coming",
      "“He was scoring all kinds of goals there, and at United they’re feeding him breadcrumbs. The players behind him aren’t giving him opportunities so he’s having to do a lot of the work himself which is of course expected, you have to give a little bit back sometimes.",
      "“That was Rasmus Hojlund’s issue, too. He struggled in the Premier League because he wasn’t fed enough, but also agility-wise and quickness of feet, they were reasons he struggled, too. That’s why he’s been given the opportunity to flourish in the Serie A because the pace of that league is no where near the speed of the Premier League.”",
      "It’s unlikely that England will take many Man Utd players to the World Cup but Parker has addressed the media narrative surrounding former Old Trafford transfer target Jude Bellingham, who now stars for Real Madrid and the Three Lions.",
      "Parker added: “If you’re going on current form, Morgan Rogers should be starting ahead of Jude Bellingham for England next summer at the World Cup. When you play with England you try and make everything as close to a club’s scenario as possible.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Bruno Fernandes limp exclusive as Antoine Semenyo decision YESTERDAY",
      "“The issue is that the media have been so pivotal in driving Bellingham’s narrative. The media have been pushing Bellingham since the Euros to make it all about him. When you look at Rogers, he’s that one player in the team who’s allowed to go wherever he wants, he often comes in from the left-hand side to score goals.",
      "“I love what Rogers is doing for Villa but also what Eberechi Eze did for Crystal Palace when he played a similar role. Eze was outstanding at that time and I think he was the best in the Premier League in that position last season.",
      "“I think that freedom has been taken away from him by Mikel Arteta since going to Arsenal. They bought him for what he was delivering and then when they got him, they’ve tried to get him to do something different. It doesn’t make sense for that kind of money.",
      "“Cole Palmer is another vying for that role and he’s good in the big games. He’s proven that for club and country already. It’s about him getting the games back under his belt after his injury, but for me he’s the most standout player. He plays off the cuff, not that Rogers and Eze don’t, but Palmer stands out the most, the issue is there that he’s got a manager who’s still trying to school him.”",

      "So yes, we were surprised by that. We have been surprised by absolutely nothing they have done since, though. An even halfway-sensible club of Tottenham’s size would have recognised the enormous potential of the launchpad it provided. A real chance to be the start of something.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim believes that Kobbie Mainoo is still the future of the club despite his lack of game time; Mainoo is unlikely to leave in January despite speculation surrounding his future",
      "Wednesday 24 December 2025 14:50, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim believes Kobbie Mainoo is the future of Manchester United despite the speculation surrounding the midfielder's future.",
      "Amorim has not started Mainoo in a single Premier League game this season, with his last league start coming in May during a 2-0 defeat to West Ham.",
      "An injury to Bruno Fernandes, who Amorim described as Mainoo's competition, may give the 20-year-old an opportunity once he recovers from a calf injury, and his head coach has insisted that he sees the player's future being at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that. If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Mainoo's lack of game time under Amorim has prompted interest from clubs across the Premier League and in Europe, with both loan and permanent exits being touted for the England international.",
      "However, with Fernandes' injury and players away for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim admits that it is unlikely that Mainoo will be allowed to leave in January.",
      "\"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here.",
      "\"We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.\"",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",
      "With numbers thin on the ground, United may be forced to be active in the January transfer market, with the club among a number of suitors interested in Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If any signing is to happen, it is not going to be done in a panic as Amorim has insisted the club will stick to their plans with regards to any potential business.",
      "\"We are struggling in this moment but the club, we have a plan and we are going to stick with it,\" he insisted.",
      "\"If we have the opportunity to bring a player who we think is going to be the future of the club, he's going to come.",
      "\"When I look at the team, when we have the full squad, I need to take more quality from that group. If we can bring someone good, if not, then we will spend money in the summer.\"",

      "Amorim is hoping Fernandes' absence will give other players the chance to step up and lead the team, as well as take up his position in midfield.",
      "\"It's impossible to replace Bruno,\" the head coach said in his pre-match press conference. \"But I said that this morning to the team, we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, and a lot of people need to step up.",

      "On who might come in for Fernandes in Man Utd's midfield, Amorim added: \"We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing.",

      "By Callum Bishop, Adam Bate, Noah Langford, Sam Cohen",
      "Friday 26 December 2025 10:57, UK",
      "For the first time since he joined in 2020, Manchester United face the prospect of losing the talismanic Bruno Fernandes through injury for a sustained period of time.",
      "Fernandes was replaced at half-time during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa after suddenly pulling up late in the first-half. United boss Ruben Amorim clarified after the game that his captain had suffered soft tissue damage and that he would miss 'some games.'",
      "It's a bitter blow for the Red Devils ahead of a busy period that could define their season. Every statistic under the sun shows just how valuable the 31-year-old is at Old Trafford.",
      "Most, if not all Manchester United fans will be thinking that this is the opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo to prove his worth to Ruben Amorim.",
      "From scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final and representing England at that year's European Championships, the midfielder finds himself without a Premier League start this season.",
      "It has led to speculation that he could depart the Theatre of Dreams, on loan or permanently, as frustration over game time grows.",
      "Unexpectedly, the door has now opened. With Fernandes out, there is no chance Amorim lets Mainoo go in January. And having insisted that the club captain is who the academy graduate is competing with for a place in the team, it seems only logical that he will finally be handed his opportunity.",
      "That won't be against Newcastle though, as Amorim confirmed he will likely miss out with a calf injury that also saw him left out of the squad against Villa. He'll be hoping one of the other alternative options doesn't lay claim to the spot before he even has a chance to.Callum Bishop",
      "Mason Mount has started Manchester United's last three Premier League games. Into his third season as a United player, this is only the second time that he has been on such a run, previously starting four in a row at the back end of last season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's absence has opened up a slot for him tucked in off the right but Mount has had plenty of Premier League minutes in a deeper role and could prove a good foil alongside the far less mobile Casemiro. He would appear an able deputy for Fernandes.",
      "Of course, shifting him from the forward line, particularly with Mbeumo and Amad Diallo away, would only present Amorim with another challenge and it may be that Mount's pressing higher up the pitch is deemed a more important asset to the United coach.Adam Bate",
      "\"In the first half they were by far the better team and surprisingly, I thought with Martinez in midfield in the second half, they were the equal of [Aston] Villa as a minimum.\"",
      "Those were Gary Neville's words as Lisandro Martinez was brought on at the break to replace the injured Fernandes at Villa Park.",
      "Martinez is primarily a centre-back, but has shown he can step into midfield when required. The Argentine is not unfamiliar with that position. During his time at Ajax, he was at times utilised in the middle of the park.",
      "In his 22 games as a stereotypical number six, he averaged close to 66 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy above 86 per cent, ranked highly for final-third passes among others in those games, and still contributed defensively with solid numbers for tackles, interceptions and possessions won in the middle third.",
      "Martinez would not offer the same creativity as Fernandes, but his ability to recycle possession, read the game and maintain structure could provide a different type of balance in midfield. With fixtures coming thick and fast, his versatility gives Amorim another internal option to consider while United’s captain remains unavailable.Sam Cohen",
      "With Casemiro suspended against Aston Villa, it was left to Manuel Ugarte to try and slot in next to Fernandes, though he did little to rubber stamp his credentials.",
      "Ugarte once again failed to impress. He was lacklustre with and without the ball - he didn’t create any big chances or manage a single shot on target, whilst also losing the most aerial duels of any player in the game.",
      "Defeat on Sunday means that the Uruguayan has lost all seven of his last seven starts. To boot, an eighth loss in nine marks the longest run without a Premier League victory for a starting Man Utd player for over two decades. Only Kleberson, between January 2004 and May 2005, managed a longer winless run in a red shirt.",
      "Ugarte’s hefty £50.7m price tag has come into question frequently during his tenure in Manchester, especially given the recent success of his predecessor, Scott McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave United for £26m - only half of the outlay for Ugarte.",
      "Just this weekend, McTominay won the Italian Supercoppa, his second piece of silverware since moving to Italy, off the back of being named Serie A Player of the Year last month.",
      "He likely would’ve been an ideal solution. But the man who essentially took his place in the squad has done little to silence the doubters.Noah Langford",
      "There was something noticably different about the way United set up against Aston Villa. As opposed to leading with a pressing front three and double pivot behind, Amorim opted to defensively lead with a front two and a triangle three propping up behind, including Fernandes, Mount and Ugarte.",
      "Assuming Casemiro would return in place of the latter, this could be something Amorim turns to more often. Mount or Mainoo could slot into the Fernandes role, with the other remaining further up the pitch.",
      "Should Bryan Mbeumo return from AFCON before Fernandes is fit to return, perhaps he links up with Matheus Cunha up top while Benjamin Sesko takes up an impact substitute role as he continues his adaptation to the Premier League.",
      "This would still give Mount the chance to take up an important position in the team given his growing influence on the side of late.Callum Bishop",
      "We'd be remissed not to touch upon the fact that there could be a surprise inclusion for one of United's youngsters to step into the team with Fernandes out.",
      "Jack Fletcher, son of former Red Devil and current lead coach of the club's under-18s side Darren, made his senior debut off the bench at Villa Park and has been touted as a potential star of the future. His twin brother, Tyler, also plays as a midfielder and may see a chance for himself.",
      "Eighteen-year-old Jim Thwaites has also been earning praise for his development, while Sekou Kone has had experienced training with the first-team before. Although, recent fitness struggles may set back any hopes he has of a sniff.",
      "Amorim has not long spoken about the entitlement of some of his youngsters, but now he may have to rely on them more than previously.Callum Bishop",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "To be honest, being truthful, the first two, three days… I'm not really an emotional person to be honest, but they are the worst feelings I've ever had in my life.",
      "Then a week passes, two weeks pass, and you look at it like: I can never feel that bad again. I can never feel like I did that day when I found out.",
      "So everything from there is just like, say that's down there, well, even if you might be here, at least you're not down there. So then it gives you that reason to go, 'no, no, this can't get the better of me'.",
      "It just gives you more of a purpose and a focus that you can overcome it, because you've overcome this and you've come out the other end.",

      "I'm lucky to have the family around me that I do. It's such a cliché thing to say, but I would not be where I am today without him and my family.",
      "It's impossible at six, seven, eight years old to drive yourself to training or make certain times and stuff like that. You have to rely on them to get you through that part.",
      "When you're young, all you want to do is get old. You get to 18 and all you want to do is drive and then you want to do this and that.",
      "I've said it before but you have such a different outlook on life when things like this have happened because there's nothing that can prepare you for it.",
      "But you become more grateful and you become more humble, and stuff that you might have looked down your nose at and thought that's just part of everyday life, it kind of rises up to your eye level and you think you've got to be grateful for what you have.",
      "It has given me a different perspective, but it's making a situation that is really tough and taking as many positives out of it as I can.",
      "Otherwise you can't live the rest of your life being negative and so upset about it.",
      "You have to try and be positive and you have to try and give yourself a purpose and a reason to get up every day. To work hard, achieve your dreams and goals that he would want you to do if he was still here.",
      "You've just got to crack on.",
      "I think for me, you look at it and you look at the effect that it has on other people, but then you also look at how much people appreciate that person who isn't there.",
      "That is the simple fact where people don't realise how appreciated they are and they don't realise what they do for others and this is the thing, we do take it for granted.",
      "Even if someone's having the best time of their life and everything's going well and they might have a business and it's doing really well, whatever it might be, it's still checking in on them because you don't want it to just become a point where it's like, only when things are going wrong, 'are you okay?'",

      "I know it will 100 per cent feel like such a big thing and it'd be so difficult to talk and you feel like it's also that feeling of being past help but you're never ever past help like if you reach out… there isn't an age limit on when you can speak up or go to therapy or, you know, make a situation better.",
      "There is no age limit, there is no time limit, there is nobody who could speak to me about how they were feeling and I'd shut it down or I'd disregard it.",
      "Like just speaking up and it could honestly be a two-minute conversation but you don't realise like how much that might help you.",
      "My dad wouldn't have known how much he was loved and cared for. I had messages from people... he was working at a tyre place changing tyres, people who've met him once saying 'oh, such a lovely man,' so on and so forth. You don't realise you have people that you meet once or people that you meet a million times...",
      "You know, just speaking about how you feel, you know, there's never, and definitely in my case, there would never be a time that I would shut that down.",
      "The club have been amazing since I've come back in.",
      "It's one of them, I was back in a week after because I think this is my passion and it's a positive distraction, it's what I enjoy doing but if I needed to take a month, two months, whatever it might be, there wouldn't have been a problem.",
      "I've been here for so long, it's like my family and at times you see people at football more than you see your family at home and you're so close to them.",
      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",

      "Antoine Semenyo will be one of the most sought-after players in the January transfer window; Man City and Manchester United are at the front of the queue but Liverpool are also interested - so where will the Bournemouth winger end up in 2026?",
      "Tuesday 23 December 2025 14:41, UK",
      "Manchester United, Manchester City or Liverpool? The race for Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is on a knife edge.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are still ahead of other clubs and remain neck-and-neck for his signature.",
      "But Liverpool remain interested and are understood to be considering their options in the wake of Alexander Isak's injury.",
      "Spurs, who were interested in the Bournemouth forward over the summer and earlier this season, are moving onto other targets and out of the race.",
      "\"If Liverpool come in for him, he'll go to Liverpool. Liverpool is too good a move to turn down. They have been big admirers of him. They have looked at signing him before.",
      "\"They also have a track record of signing players in January. Luis Diaz looked like he was going to Tottenham and at the last minute Liverpool came in for him. Cody Gakpo looked like he was going to Manchester United.",
      "\"Liverpool don't get involved in a bidding war. They wait until the last minute, until other clubs almost do a deal for a player and then they make a phone call to say they will match the deal.",
      "\"Liverpool are expected to have a quiet January. There is money to spend. Sometimes they move quickly to get a summer target in if they think they are going to go somewhere else.",
      "\"Over the next few days, especially in light of Isak's injury, there will be discussions over whether they make a late move for Semenyo.\"",
      "Kaveh Solhekol:",
      "\"If I'm Antoine Semenyo. I'm looking at that Man City squad and thinking, dream come true to sign for Man City. On the other hand, how much game time am I going to get if I move there?",
      "\"I'm not really sure there is a desperate need for them to spend money in January.",
      "\"Another interesting subplot is Pep Guardiola's future. He signed a new contract that takes him to the summer of 2027, but there is talks already that he might call it a day this summer.",
      "\"What impact could that have on Manchester City's transfer plans? As much as we say clubs buy players, Guardiola has been there for so long that he will have a say in which players come to the club.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has consistently said that the club will make moves in the January transfer window provided it is in the long-term interest of Manchester United.",
      "\"They have kept a keen eye on Semenyo's development. That interest goes further back than the summer transfer window.",
      "\"Semenyo signed a new contract in the summer that included a release clause of £65m. That release clause is only valid in the first half of January. That's because if someone triggers the release clause, Bournemouth want time to find a replacement.",
      "\"There is then a lower release clause in the summer transfer window. Expect some sort of movement in the first half of this transfer window.",
      "\"The interesting thing with Semenyo is if United were to sign him, where Amorim would want to play him.",
      "\"Is he going to take over from either of Cunha or Mbeumo? It's very unlikely. Is it the left-wing back position that Amorim has cited Semenyo? And would Semenyo be happy playing in that position?\"",
      "\"One thing for certain now, Mo Salah will be staying at the club. There's a good chance Harvey Elliott would come back from Aston Villa as well.",
      "\"Whether Liverpool go for a striker or another attacking player like Semenyo, who Liverpool have been heavily linked with as well, we all know he's got a buyout clause in January.",
      "\"Then you've got wide players, as in Salah and Gakpo, who've played a lot of games through the middle as well. You've got young Jayden Danns.",
      "\"That's the way they could go around it because I don't think Liverpool, when you go back a few years when they had a real problem at centre-back, they didn't go and spend big money on someone they didn't want.",
      "\"They won't go out and buy a striker who they don't really want. If they do want Semenyo, that's probably a good way around it.\"",
      "Liverpool - there are two sides to this particular route: short-term and long-term.",
      "Semenyo would be an excellent addition for Liverpool right now, with injuries to Isak and Gakpo - plus Salah's departure to AFCON - leaving Arne Slot's side short in attack for the coming weeks.",
      "That's the short-term, but the long-term vision of Semenyo at Anfield is more complicated. Should Salah leave, then Semenyo could be deemed the natural heir to the Egyptian's role at Anfield.",
      "But what happens if Salah and Slot put their issues aside and the former returns to form? Then once Gakpo and Isak return from injury, where would Semenyo fit in with Hugo Ekitike as well?",
      "Man City - this would be another interesting question regarding squad competition. With everyone fit, would Semenyo get into Man City team right now?",
      "Guardiola has finally managed to settle his squad with Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku acting as the perfect trio behind Erling Haaland.",
      "However, there is a argument that squad depth is still an issue. The recent 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League showed how the floor of City's squad could do with a lift - and Semenyo could help that.",
      "Man Utd - Amorim spent around £200m on bringing in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha over the summer, and now he wants to add more attacking quality to his ranks?",
      "Perhaps a potential January departure for Joshua Zirkzee could open up a spot in the United squad for Semenyo to fill?",
      "One area Semenyo could play is at wing-back, especially with his qualities out wide. But could he play there with Amad Diallo on the other flank? Would that be too attacking?",
      "Bournemouth - Another possibility for Semenyo could be to stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the season, especially if his desired team stalls this month.",
      "But the Cherries are a long way off being the European contenders they were last season. With Andoni Iraola's future never certain and Bournemouth's form needing to pick up, there are a few dominoes needing to fall at the south coast.",

      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing the player in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City have emerged as the frontrunners in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January but both Liverpool and Manchester United remain interested.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",
