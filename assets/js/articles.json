      "Manchester United put some early pressure on the teams above them with a hard-fought win at home to Newcastle on Boxing Day. Patrick Dorgu scored the winner, enjoying the freedom given to him by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "United had an early sight of goal when Casemiro rose highest to meet a corner from the left but he couldn't keep his header down. They kept plugging away, though, and were rewarded when Dorgu volleyed home a stunning opener midway through the first half.",
      "They were close to a second just before the hour mark when Benjamin Sesko's effort beat Aaron Ramsdale but clipped the top of the bar. Newcastle hit the woodwork themselves moments later, though, with Lewis Hall's 25-yard effort crashing back off the bar with Senne Lammens flailing.",
      "The visitors continued to put the pressure on as the game ticked on, with Anthony Gordon dragging an effort wide. The cavalry arrived moments later, with Eddie Howe introducing Yoane Wissa, Harvey Barnes and Joelinton as his side chased a leveller.",
      "Diogo Dalot missed a golden chance for a second, breaking beyond the Newcastle back-line but lifting his effort over the bar, while Matheus Cunha dragged an effort of his own well wide after a driving run. One goal was enough, though, and here are our talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "Nearly 11 months after joining Manchester United, Patrick Dorgu finally has his first goal for the club. It was a thumper, too, with the Dane running onto Nick Woltemade's headed clearance and thumping the ball out of the reach of Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "Former Lecce star Dorgu clearly had an eye for goal after getting his opener, putting Ramsdale to the test with a low right-footed effort before half-time. He spent the whole game high up the pitch, be that on the right or the left, and caused problems throughout.",
      "Earlier in the season, Ruben Amorim said he wanted to see Dorgu show more of his Denmark form in a United shirt. Odds are this was the kind of thing he was after.",
      "Manchester United saw Bruno Fernandes forced off against Aston Villa, and that will have been a worry. In their last seven league games without their captain in the starting XI, they had taken just one point.",
      "Amorim recognised it would be a tall order making up for the skipper's absence but insisted United had options. Indeed, for the first 45 minutes you'd have been hard-pressed to tell which was the team missing a key player.",
      "United looked down to the bare bones late on, and there was even a rare outing from the bench for Tyrell Malacia. They weren't doing things the easy way, but they won't complain about the result.",
      "After dismissing the idea time and time again, Ruben Amorim appeared to abandon his usual back three - at least at the start of the game. Patrick Dorgu moved into a right wing role in front of Diogo Dalot, with Luke Shaw staying wide at left-back as Ayden Heaven partnered Lisandro Martinez in the middle.",
      "Now, don't get us wrong, there's every chance the change was made out of pure necessity. Both Noussair Mazraoui and Amad are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, robbing United of two more natural wing-back options, while Dorgu might also have been used there were he not filling in for another AFCON absentee in Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Certainly, the move appeared to catch Newcastle by surprise. A message arrived with Lewis Hall during a stoppage, allowing the visitors to put their own adjustments into force.",
      "United remained on top before adding an extra centre-back in the form of Leny Yoro. That too was a bait-and-switch, though, with the Frenchman moving to right-back and Dalot thrust forward onto the wing.",
      "Before kick-off, some United fans were making the case for Jack Fletcher to start. The teenager had made his Premier League debut on Sunday and might have fancied his chances with Fernandes injured, but instead started on the bench.",
      "At the start of the second half, though, Mason Mount's withdrawal gave the youngster his chance. That meant an advanced role to begin with, and Fletcher was forced to be flexible as others were withdrawn.",
      "Fletcher's twin brother Tyler was also on the bench for United, among a youthful selection, with Tyler Fredricson introduced late on. United might be far from full strength, but the future is starting to look bright.",
      "This time last year, United put in one of their most miserable first half displays of the early part of Ruben Amorim's tenure. They found themselves 2-0 down inside 20 minutes before Amorim ruthlessly substituted Joshua Zirkzee before half-time.",
      "It was a different story this time. Tonight, Amorim's side were the ones starting quickly and their opponents - barring a few brief flashes - didn't really get a foothold until the second period.",
      "There was even time for Zirkzee to pursue a redemption arc on his personal level after arriving for the final half-hour. It was Newcastle doing most of the attacking by then, though, with the hosts' task one of containment, but revenge will have no doubt been sweet.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro's impressive form comes amid speculation about his future at the Theatre of Dreams. He is into the final six months of his contract and his future remains unclear as rumours swirl about potential midfield reinforcements, including Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson.",
      "Carragher was forced to give credit to the turnaround. He said: \"Not quite yet (laughs). Fair play to him but Man United finished 15th last season.",
      "\"You know what, when I look at him? Fair play, he looks a different player physically. I remember that night at Crystal Palace, he looks almost a stone lighter.",

      "Casemiro has become a key figure in Amorim's squad, a far cry from when Carragher suggested the Champions League victor should \"call it a day\".",
      "The midfielder came under fire after a lacklustre performance that saw Crystal Palace net four goals against Erik ten Hag's team. Michael Olise bagged a brace while Jean-Phillipe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell added to United's woes.",
      "The victory marked Palace's first league double over United in 20 years, further deepening the gloom for ten Hag's side as it confirmed their failure to qualify for European competition.",
      "In 2024, Carragher stated: \"I think Casemiro should know tonight that he should only have another three games left at the top level. The next two league games and the cup final, then he should be thinking, I need to go to the MLS or Saudi.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim named not one but two Fletcher brothers on his bench for the Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Boxing Day. Jack made his Premier League debut less than a week earlier, coming on as United lost to Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim is short on numbers, with Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo both injured. He expects Mainoo to be back sooner than captain Fernandes, and will have been grateful to be able to welcome back Casemiro after a one-game ban.",
      "The Fletcher twins, sons of former United midfielder Darren, joined the Red Devils from Manchester City's academy in 2023. A reported fee of £1.25million was enough to bring the pair to Old Trafford, where they have been playing at age group level.",
      "Darren was a Scotland international during his playing career, winning 81 senior international caps. Tyler is also in the Scotland youth set-up, but Jack has instead opted for England.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones. So, we'll find solutions to play,” Amorim told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The brothers were born in England while their dad was part of United's first team under Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning they could choose to represent either England or Scotland. Ferguson's team actually had a game on the day of their birth, but Darren wasn't involved as he'd been sidelined with an ankle ligament injury at the time.",
      "Jack has opted to represent the country of his birth at international level, though he also played for Scotland's Under-16s when he was younger. He played twice for Will Antwi's England Under-19 side during the November international break, scoring in a 4-0 victory over Scotland.",
      "Tyler was on the opposite team that day, captaining the Scottish selection. He also scored his first goal at Under-19 international level in a 2-2 draw away to Latvia earlier that month.",
      "United fans were excited to see both brothers on Amorim's bench for the Newcastle game. \"So happy to see the Fletcher twins on the bench together. What a moment for them and their family,\" one wrote.",
      "\"It must be a proud moment for the Fletcher family,\" a second said. Others, meanwhile, made it clear they would have liked to see Jack Fletcher start the game ahead of Manuel Ugarte, who struggled against Villa on Sunday.",
      "Another became painfully aware of the passage of time when looking at the teamsheet. \"From watching Darren Fletcher during his prime back in college to this, football ageing just felt real again,\" they said.",

      "Amorim and Co. will be determined to move up the standings with a victory when they face Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night.",
      "One player who has already seemingly shown why United were determined to acquire his signature is Mbeumo. The Cameroon international is currently with his country at the Africa Cup of Nations, and could be absent for another month while the tournament remains ongoing.",
      "United spent weeks being linked with signing Mbeumo before eventually getting a deal over the line worth up to £70million.",
      "A report in the Daily Mail has claimed that United's recently appointed head of data research, Mike Sansoni, played a key role in bringing Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "Sansoni previously worked for the Mercedes Formula One team for 11 years in a similar role before making the switch to United.",
      "The report claims that the data compiled by Sansoni and his team showed that United signing Mbeumo was the \"closest\" they could get to signing Salah from Liverpool.",

      "Garner has been turning heads with his performances for David Moyes' squad this season and is entering the final six months of his contract at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. According to the Daily Mail, United see Garner as a cost-effective option, as they plan to splash out on Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson in the summer.",

      "Famed for his no-nonsense attitude as both a footballer and a pundit, Roy Keane has long been associated with intensity rather than tenderness. Yet a recent revelation has shed light on a compassionate side of him that seldom attracts headlines.",
      "While Keane occasionally allows glimpses of his kinder, gentler self on social media, an Irish doctor has now shared an extraordinary memory from his Manchester United days that paints him in a very different light.",
      "Dr Niamh Ni Loinsigh recounted how Keane once arrived unexpectedly at a children's hospital in his hometown of Cork, where his presence made a profound difference to a gravely ill patient, providing \"the boost and the energy that they needed\".",
      "She explained that she had \"debated long and hard\" about whether to make the story public, but decided it was worth telling because \"people need to hear something nice\".",
      "In an online video, Dr Ni Loinsigh said: \"This is a Roy Keane appreciation post. Trigger warning, I will be discussing childhood illness and Roy Keane may also be a trigger for some of you, but most of you know that Roy Keane is a hero in Cork.\"",
      "She went on to add: \"The closest thing I ever witnessed to a Christmas miracle was facilitated I think by Roy Keane. This was 20 years ago and we were looking after a patient who was very, very unwell and it came to a point we weren't really sure if they were going to make it.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner will not sign a new contract at Selhurst Park, according to reports. The 51-year-old is said to have made the decision surrounding his future and that means he now looks set to depart the Eagles at the end of the season, when his contract expires, unless things change.",
      "The reports come following intense speculation on the Austrian's next steps with the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and even Bayern Munich mooted with an interest - prior to Vincent Kompany's switch from Burnley. Glasner has steadied the ship in south London after succeeding Roy Hodgson, guiding Palace to their first-ever FA Cup triumph after Eberechi Eze's goal was enough to beat Manchester City 1-0 at Wembley, last season.",
      "His heroics have continued with Palace qualifying for the UEFA Conference League play-offs, with games-in-hand, as their next target is winning their remaining fixtures and bypassing the extra European matches to qualify for the knockout stages, and steering them to within three points of the top-four after 17 matches.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Glasner has decided that he will not extend his spell at Palace, meaning his two-and-a-half-year stint will come to an end in June when his current deal expires.",
      "In a tweet, he wrote: \"Understand Oliver Glasner plans not to sign new deal at Crystal Palace... Austrian manager made his decision with next steps to follow + focused on continuing his excellent work this season.\"",
      "The 51-year-old had performed similar heroics over in Germany with Eintracht Frankfurt after winning the Europa League in 2022, beating Scottish Premiership side Rangers on penalties in the final.",
      "And, over recent months, he has been touted as a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Arne Slot following their struggles at Manchester United and Liverpool, respectively.",
      "The Red Devils head coach has been under pressure after enduring difficulties heeding United's downturn in form, losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur last term with that, in turn, denying European football at Old Trafford this year.",
      "However, there has been no suggestion Glasner would, formally, be in line to succeed Amorim should the former Sporting CP head coach be relieved of his duties. United's minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe previously backed the Portugues and suggested that Amorim would need three years to prove himself.",
      "Glasner has been rumoured as one proposed successor to Amorim, but has previously refused to be drawn on the speculation over taking up the Theatre of Dreams hot-seat.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I'm successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he said.",
      "\"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",
      "\"It's simply better when you don't lose 19 games than when you don't win 19. Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier.",
      "\"I'm no less ambitious, no less demanding, and just as annoyed when we lose, like now. Even if it was the first defeat in six months: I'm one of the worst losers in the world, and I'm still annoyed about it today.\"",
      "After a period of uncertainty with two spells under Hodgson - as well as a period with Arsenal great Patrick Vieira in charge - Palace have emerged as European contenders.",
      "Back in October, Glasner revealed he was in talks with Palace, over a possible extension at Selhurst Park. However, the new reports suggest that the negotiations have reached an impasse.",
      "He said: \"We are talking almost every day. It is not that I need conditions or I want something, Crystal Palace wants to be successful, to continue this pathway and not just the last 18 months.",
      "\"What we are always discussing is how can we have the best chance to continue this pathway?",
      "\"Oliver Glasner does not have the final solution and Steve Parish doesn't have (it), but we discuss about it, what is possible, what we can do. Working together and having a relationship together just makes sense if you have the same goals, the same vision, because otherwise you can't be successful.",
      "\"Wherever it is, in any company, if two leaders have different visions, then you go separate ways and you can't achieve your goal, and that is what we are talking about.",
      "\"If we can find the same pathway, the same goal - not for Oliver Glasner, (but) for Crystal Palace - then we will end the talks, and if we don't find (it) we will also end the talks.\"",
      "The summer transfer window, meanwhile, saw Palace endure a frustrating time as they lost FA Cup hero, Eze, to Arsenal and were on the brink of losing club captain Marc Guehi to Liverpool before the plug was pulled on a deadline day move. There is still a threat of Palace losing their skipper with the Reds among the clubs pushing to sign the England international on a free transfer next summer, when his deal expires.",
      "On the incomings front, it was an equally difficult time for Glasner, initially signing Walter Benitez from PSV Eindhoven before a late splurge saw Borna Sosa, Yeremi Pino and Jaydee Canvot sign with Christantus Uche making a loan move from Getafe.",
      "At the end of August, meanwhile, Glasner voiced his frustration about the lack of transfer activity - something he blamed for their slow start in 2024.",
      "\"I can't do anything,\" he said. I can't sign a player's contract. We have to act. We need this. This is Crystal Palace's future. It's easy to add numbers, we need to add the right players.",
      "\"The profile has been defined for months, for months. Also it's not surprising for everyone that Ebs left, because five days earlier we couldn't have done anything if he leaves (due to his release clause).",
      "\"We knew that this chance is very high that this would happen, and honestly, I say it like it is, we missed the chance to replace him early enough. That's completely our fault, and nobody else's fault.\"",

      "The January transfer window looks set to be a busy one at Manchester United. But unlike in the summer, it's outgoings that are expected to grab the most headlines.",
      "Ruben Amorim is a year into the job and the makeup of the Red Devils' squad has already changed drastically. Several players signed by previous managers have been shifted, with more still on the chopping block.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe infamously put virtually every player up for sale in the summer which saw names such as Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony depart. With United still yet to find consistency in the Premier League, clubs chiefs are willing to offload dead wood in order to fund their ongoing rebuild.",
      "A number of academy players are also waiting by the exit door ahead of potential departures. Even those who've already been out on loan could be on the move, too.",
      "The most advanced potential move ahead of the window opening, Joshua Zirkzee could be a Roma player very soon. The Athletic report that a loan with an obligation to buy offer has been put on the table via intermediaries, with United now considering it.",
      "Personal terms aren't expected to be a problem, as Netherlands international Zirkzee wants to join Roma and make a bid to play at the World Cup next summer. However, clubs-to-club talks regarding the 24-year-old haven't yet taken place.",
      "Who should Manchester United sign in January? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "Yet to play a minute this season, it appears that Tyrell Malacia's departure from Old Trafford is a matter of when not if. A long-term injury layoff has effectively ruined the Dutch left-back's career at United.",
      "Malacia, 26, spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven but it wasn't made permanent. His contract with United expires in June.",
      "Now officially recalled by United, Toby Collyer is expected to be loaned out for the second time this season once he recovers from a calf injury. The 21-year-old midfielder recently returned to Old Trafford for treatment, having been playing regular football at West Bromwich Albion.",
      "But when he returns to fitness, Collyer won't be heading back to the Hawthorns. The former Brighton prospect is instead set to go on another temporary move.",
      "One player who could stay with the same loan club is Harry Amass. The left-back, 18, joined Sheffield Wednesday for the first half of the season and he's been a rare bright spot at Hillsborough amid their struggles.",
      "Amass' performances have seen other Championship clubs take notice. Wednesday are hoping to extend his stay until the end of campaign, as they battle to avoid relegation.",
      "Having been signed by United in a deal worth up to £7million in July, Diego Leon has exclusively played in the academy after making first-team appearances during pre-season. The Paraguayan left-back is still adapting to English football, so a loan would make sense.",
      "Still only 18, however, United may wait until next season to give Leon first-team opportunities either elsewhere on at Old Trafford. In October, the teenager earned his first senior call-up for Paraguay and made his debut against South Korea, showing how highly regarded he is after making his name at Cerro Porteno.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim was compelled to reshuffle his team for the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa in their last match, with Casemiro benched due to an accumulation of five bookings, the latest of which came against Bournemouth.",
      "The Portuguese coach is already stretched thin, with Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad unavailable due to their participation in the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Dorgu, aged 21, has featured in 16 Premier League matches this season, starting half of them and even providing an assist in the last game at Villa Park.",
      "The full-back has managed to avoid a booking in his last six appearances for United and will need to maintain this discipline in the upcoming matches against Newcastle and Wolves to dodge suspension, as the Premier League bookings reset is set to take place after matchday 19.",
      "Should a player collect 10 yellow cards in Premier League matches up to and including their team's 32nd game, they will face a two-match suspension.",
      "Dorgu remains the sole player facing the threat of a ban, whilst Mbeumo trails behind with three yellow cards to his name.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw are safe from serving a suspension as they each have two cautions.",
      "Nevertheless, Fernandes could be sidelined for up to a month after being withdrawn at half-time during the clash with Aston Villa.",

This is another blow for United, who have just lost their midfield maestro, Bruno Fernandes, for a while due to a hamstring injury sustained in the loss to Aston Villa.",

      "Eddie Howe has confessed he might not remain in the Newcastle hot seat long enough to witness the club's unveiling of either a revamped stadium or enhanced training facilities.",
      "Merely 12 months ago, the Magpies appeared miles ahead of Boxing Day rivals Manchester United, yet now find themselves trailing the Red Devils in the Premier League standings and could fall six points adrift should they stumble at Old Trafford.",
      "New boardroom chief David Hopkinson has set his sights on propelling Newcastle into the elite tier by 2030, though the Tyneside outfit may well begin 2026 languishing in the league's lower reaches.",
      "Chief executive Hopkinson cautioned this month that Newcastle will remain at St James' Park in its present state for \"years to come\" whilst enhancement work continues at their existing Benton training headquarters. Renovation plans for the club's neighbouring Academy facilities are already in motion.",
      "However, Howe, who has managed just six victories from 17 fixtures this season, offered a sobering glimpse into his long-term prospects before the crucial encounter at United.",
      "When quizzed about the club's communication with supporters regarding stadium relocation and facility upgrades - with Saudi backers PIF still unable to finalise new ground proposals five years post-takeover - a frank Howe, despite having at least three years remaining on his deal, remarked: \"It (messaging) is important, but there are other things that are important - it has to be right.",
      "\"If there is extra time taken to make the right decisions, and I'm not across the day-to-day decision-making process, so the stadium project is correct and it's the right one for Newcastle for however many years the club are there, then take the extra time.",
      "\"It's the same with the training ground. You need the right site and designs. I would rather it was correct than rushed. I know there's a 99.9 per cent chance that I'm not going to see either in my position, but I'm still passionate about making sure it's there for the future generations of Newcastle, whether that's supporters or players.",
      "\"The board recognise how important that is too. So I think the ambition and drive is there to do it and work is going on behind the scenes. There just needs to be a bit of patience to make sure it's the right solution for everybody.\"",
      "Howe went on to describe the club's long-term vision on Tyneside as being stuck in \"limbo\". The manager explained: \"Fundamentally, looking at the club with a broader view, you look at the training ground, stadium, that part of the club is in limbo at the moment.",
      "\"In terms of which direction the club is going to take, that would be a big step forward to get clarity on that and to take everything into the future in a really positive way, it would have a game-changing effect on everything.",
      "\"I am also talking about the academy in that. The brilliant work that goes on down there, if we can move everything forward in terms of facilities, not that I believe facilities are the be all and end all, they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a clear and strong way.",
      "\"That would be a game-changer when that happens. The ambition is there from everyone to make that happen.",
      "\"In terms of the team, I think the way we play is key. If we can really work on our identity and clarity of our vision, I and the coaching staff, work on what we believe and ultimately end up a successful period at Newcastle.",
      "\"We have to work on that like we do every day with really strong resolve, and the players are left in no uncertain terms what we expect. I think we will be a better team for that.\"",
      "As Newcastle gear up to bid farewell to 2025, they'll do so with silverware proudly displayed in the St James' Park trophy room after breaking their 70-year barren spell. Their European Cup ambitions remain alive and kicking as spring approaches.",
      "Howe refused to let negativity overshadow what has been a remarkable year, explaining: \"The last 12 months, I think, as a whole have been unbelievable for us because we finally won a trophy, and when I came here, that was the big aim – after staying in the league – to try to win a trophy.",
      "\"Of course, then you look at Champions League qualification, and we're in the middle of that and it's a great experience again to be in the Champions League and we're desperate to stay in the competition.",
      "\"Overall, sometimes it's really good to take that bird's eye view of everything. You'd say it's been a great 12 months.\"",
      "Yet only securing a result at Old Trafford will silence Howe's doubters. Discussing the upcoming clash, Howe commented: \"Statistically, they're a lot stronger than last year. They've seen big improvements in their general performances. They've been competitive and, attacking-wise, they have some big threats.",
      "\"I think it'll be a really good game, a tough game, for us and a good opportunity at Christmas to enjoy the magnitude of these games. The atmosphere will be special but we haven't played them previously, I think we expect a slightly different Man United.\"",

      "European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich hold an interest but despite not giving him a single start in the Premier League this season, Amorim views him as part of his long-term plans. It comes just a week after the Red Devils boss told Mainoo that he needs to 'fight for his job' before a calf injury ruled him out of last Sunday's 2-1 defeat away to Aston Villa.",
      "\"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling,\" Amorim declared. \"He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "The United manager added: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim then played down the chances of Mainoo leaving Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "Mainoo will miss the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle because of his injury. The timing is especially frustrating given that Bruno Fernandes is also sidelined and Casemiro missed the Villa game through suspension.",
      "This season, Mainoo has only started one match. That was United's humiliating loss against League Two side Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August.",
      "Also in his pre-Newcastle press conference, Amorim confirmed that no decisions have been made regarding the futures of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, who are both out of contract in June. \"There is no decision,\" the Portuguese added.",

We have so much to do in this moment. We are not thinking about that. I am really happy with them but I don't know what is going to happen.\"",

      "Andreas Pereira confessed that he deliberately avoided speaking with Erik ten Hag before leaving Manchester United to avoid being persuaded to stay. The Brazilian midfielder, currently starring at Palmeiras, made the switch from PSV's youth setup for the opportunity to work under legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "At that time, Ten Hag served as assistant manager at the Dutch club and made considerable efforts to keep the promising youngster. Pereira ultimately made the move to Old Trafford in 2014 and made his senior bow that same year in a League Cup clash against MK Dons.",
      "Despite an eight-year association with Manchester, the midfielder managed just 75 appearances and had loan spells at four separate clubs. Following his final temporary stint at Flamengo in 2021, Pereira felt it was time for a fresh start and was poised to join Fulham for approximately £10million.",
      "However, the midfielder chose to ignore then-United manager Ten Hag due to a previous encounter with the boss at his former youth club. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, the Brazilian confessed he felt unwanted during his Manchester tenure.",
      "Pereira said: \"This was when I came back to England [after my loan]. Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team.' But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United.'",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here. You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad.' That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "Reflecting on his choice to leave Old Trafford, the now 29-year-old said: \"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after Covid, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining [Everton] and suddenly my father called me and said, 'Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you're Brazilian.'",
      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn't feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football. Everyone at United said, 'You're crazy, you'll stay in Brazil, you'll never come back to Europe.'\"",

      "Morgan Rogers has been named as Manchester United's 'dream signing' ahead of the January transfer window. Rogers, 23, is in the form of his life and continued his purple patch during Aston Villa's 2-1 win at home to United last Sunday.",
      "The England international scored both of Villa's goals; the first a wonderful curling effort from distance while the second was a similar finish from closer range. The victory made it 10 in a row for title hopefuls Villa and, after Bruno Fernandes went off injured, showed Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim the kind of player that he's missing.",
      "That's the verdict of former United striker Louis Saha, who wants United to make an ambitious bid for Rogers. \"In January, I see a need for a replacement who can spark our midfield creativity,\" Saha told FootItalia.",
      "\"In addition to Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, there's a need for speed in the creativity there. I think Conor Gallagher would've been a good signing, he has the legs and the power, I'd also love to see Morgan Rogers at United.",
      "\"He definitely has this power, he reminds me a bit of Joelinton. That kind of power, and still very technical, and able to go forward. Having that kind of presence in the midfield is so important.",
      "\"I see Rogers as being able to actually bomb forward, but also get pressed and keep the ball, giving time for other players to move into different positions. He is the type of player United need.\"",
      "\"It's a very interesting profile that's rare in the sense that a lot of players are very athletic, but in terms of making the right choice with that athleticism, that's not easy. So I can see Rogers as being a dream signing.\"",
      "Notably, Rogers has a connection with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, from their time at Manchester City. Wilcox was running City's academy when they paid £4.3million to sign a 16-year-old Rogers from West Bromwich Albion in 2019, so the forward will be no stranger to the United hierarchy.",
      "Various City academy graduates are flourishing in the Premier League, the most prominent being Cole Palmer. United would no-doubt love to reap the rewards of their rivals' oversight but if anyone comes knocking for Rogers, Villa will drive a hard bargain.",
      "\"Morgan Rogers is performing fantastically, but he has started the season not getting (goalscoring) numbers but playing well,\" Unai Emery said after beating United. \"Always doing his task, always with the commitment he's showing, with the attitude he has, played each match.",
      "\"Today he did the same and scored goals, of course. He is the protagonist. I'm so, so happy because he's a fighter. He's a good guy, very good guy. His commitment with Aston Villa is massive, and his attitude every day is really fantastic. And when he's getting numbers like today, of course we are very proud of everybody, but especially today with him.\"",

      "Becoming a Premier League footballer often means your financial concerns are over. As fans know, players are paid astronomical sums to play the game we love.",
      "Even after retiring from the sport many ex-players head down the road of punditry, coaching or other business ventures, to highly lucrative ends. However, three players from Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have gone on, or will go on, to extraordinary wealth after hanging up their boots.",
      "The French striker, now 47, played for United from 2004 to 2008. He enjoyed a hugely successful career at Old Trafford, winning two league titles, the Champions League and League Cup under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Saha's company 'AxisStars' is now worth a stunning £4.3billion. The company, which was co-founded by Kate Hamer, is in charge of connecting relationships between \"professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners\".",
      "According to several sources, over 550 ex-athletes are connected with the firm. Saha admitted he gets inquiries from people asking for his advice and was candid in saying that starting up AxisStars has surpassed anything he's done in his footballing career.",
      "\"I still get asked for advice by different people on a daily basis,\" he once told The Guardian. \"For instance, my agent called me to say he had a talented French footballer who he wants to bring to England, and asked me for advice on how to create a tailor-made training programme. I put him in touch with people I used to work with.\"",
      "Saha scored 42 goals in 124 games, even though his time at United was blighted by injuries. By the time he hung up his boots in 2013 at the age of 35, Saha had played for Metz, Newcastle, Everton, Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland and Lazio.",
      "Former Arsenal midfielder Flamini founded GF Biochemicals nine years before his retirement. He became CEO later on and now has a reported net worth of around £10bn",
      "He even took a more hands-on role following his retirement from football. Becoming CEO saw him take a 60% stake that cemented his status as one of the wealthiest men to ever play football.",
      "GF Biochemicals aims to provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to petrochemicals, which would allow the manufacture of products without harming the environment. Flamini has previously explained his career change following retirement. \"As a child I had two passions: football and sustainability,\" he said.",
      "The French star made 246 appearances in two spells for the Gunners, before leaving on a free transfer in 2017. The now 41-year-old had two spells at Arsenal. The first came between 2004 and 2008 and he later made a return to the Emirates Stadium in 2013.",
      "During his time with the club, he won five trophies including three FA Cups and two Community Shields. Arsenal was not the only Premier League team he played for either, with the midfielder spending a short spell with Crystal Palace following his second exit from Arsenal.",
      "Ex-Chelsea youth player Bolkiah is the son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah and nephew of the Sultan of Brunei, who is reported to be worth around £37bn. Bolkiah is the heir to a £15 bn fortune meaning football icons such as Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and Lionel Messi's bank balances all pale in comparison.",
      "Former Chelsea team-mate, Ruben Sammut, once claimed Bolkiah was as humble as they come. Previously speaking to The Athletic, Sammut said: \"You would never ever have thought he was something like the 12th in line to the throne. You would not have thought of him as royalty.\"",
      "After spells with Chelsea and Southampton. Bolkiah later signed for Leicester City but despite being with the Foxes for four years, he never made a senior appearance.",

Casemiro also returns from suspension.",

      "Ruben Amorim admitted it would be \"hard\" to sanction a loan exit for Kobbie Mainoo if Manchester United cannot replace him. Mainoo has not started for United in the Premier League this season. The youngster was potentially in line to receive his first start against Aston Villa last weekend, but he picked up a calf injury in training and was ruled out of that match in Birmingham.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window and could request to leave again in the January window when he returns from the sidelines. However, Bruno Fernandes picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa and United's midfield options will be lighter during his absence.",
      "Amorim admitted the moving parts could mean a potential request to leave on loan from Mainoo would be rejected. \"If we are not getting someone [in], then we are shorter,\" he said.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter when something can happen here. We are a club with a big responsibility, we are dealing with all these issues and in your head, my head, and everyone's heads, we need to win every game, it doesn't matter, there are no excuses, so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution [new signing].\"",
      "When asked whether Mainoo could kick on when he returns to fitness in the absence of Fernandes, Amorim said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity that he has all the time.",
      "\"He played in different positions and we talk about the position of Casemiro - he can do that. He can play, if you play with three, like we did in the last game, the position of Mason Mount in this game, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United. That is my feeling, so he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football, even in two days.\"",
      "United's target is to seal a return to European football this season, but Amorim would not predict whether his squad could qualify for the Champions League if no new signings are made in the January window.",
      "\"I think it's hard to talk about that,\" he said. \"What I can say is we have the potential to do more, and I think I can do more with the team, and I can help the team to be better. That I can say.",
      "\"If it's top four, it's different in our club, not everything around our club is so simple. We have the talent to reach it, but there is so much more than that in the team. The only thing I can say is that if we have the full squad, I think I can help them to play better and we can be better in the future.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is \"happy\" with Casemiro and Harry Maguire, but could not answer whether a decision had been made on both players' futures ahead of their contract expiry at the end of the season. Casemiro, 33, has enjoyed a renaissance at Old Trafford, becoming an important player again after a period of not starting games under Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian has started 14 games out of a possible 17 in the Premier League this term, leading to speculation that his stay in Manchester could be extended beyond the summer. United have the option to extend Casemiro's contract by 12 months, but he is the highest earner in the dressing room and he would continue to earn the same salary if the clause were triggered.",
      "Maguire has made just four starts in the Premier League this season and has not played since picking up a hamstring injury against Tottenham on November 8. There is no option to extend Maguire's deal by 12 months because that option was already triggered by United last year.",
      "When asked whether Amorim had an update on the pair, he said: \"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do. We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing.",
      "\"So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will think just think about the next game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would like to keep both players and responded: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "And discussing whether the uncertainty could impact Casemiro's form, Amorim said: \"It's not that situation, I'm not saying whether he is staying or not. Then when I see Casemiro training, if everyone trained like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in set-piece training.",
      "\"Even when they are playing 10 versus the goalkeeper and the movement that he makes. Imagine in the game, we will be a top team. If everybody works like Casemiro. And when I say work, it's not just about the running, it's the focus, and you can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues.",
      "\"If you pay attention to everything that he does, with contract or with no contract, he's a top player.\"",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for their former midfielder James Garner in the January transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils were interested in a number of playmakers in the summer but were unable to add to their current options. Brighton & Hove Albion star Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson are both on the Red Devils' radar.",
      "According to the MailOnline, Garner is another option. The 24-year-old made the switch from United to Everton in 2022 and has established himself as a regular for the Merseyside club this season.",
      "The likes of Aston Villa and Newcastle have been linked with a possible approach for Garner, who has also played at right-back and left-back at times this season for the Blues.",
      "Garner's current Everton contract is set to expire at the end of this campaign, although the deal includes an option to extend by a further year.",
      "The player was asked about his future recently and while Everton are trying to tie him down to fresh terms, he gave no indication that an agreement was close.",
      "\"I haven't thought much about it, no,\" he said after the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on December 13, per the ECHO. \"I am just touching in week in, week out.",
      "\"You cant really think too far ahead, so week in, week out, I am just trying to get better as a player and try and help the team as much as I can.",
      "\"We have come on leaps and bounds since I first joined the club, so we are definitely moving in the right direction.\"",
      "Everton manager David Moyes has also made it clear how much he values Garner and wants to keep him at the club.",
      "\"Look, I wouldn't be letting [Garner] go and I think the Club will do everything they can to make sure that he stays,\" added Moyes. \"It's probably a bit of a difference and shows signs [of progression] because I'm not sure many clubs have been after many Everton players in the past but now they're maybe starting to take a bit of interest, which is a good sign.",
      "\"Hopefully he signs a new contract when the time comes but at the end of the season hes got an option [of an extra year extension] as well so, obviously, well be on that, if we need to be.\"",
      "If Everton don't trigger the extension before January 1 then Garner could feasibly agree a pre-contract with a team from overseas with a view to moving on a free transfer in the summer.",

      "Casemiro's solid run of form comes during uncertainty surrounding his future at the Theatre of Dreams. The Brazil international is entering the final six months of his contract while reports circulate surrounding an influx of midfield additions, as Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson continue to be linked as part of an engine room rebuild.",
      "\"Not quite yet (laughs),\" Carragher said. \"Fair play to him but Man United finished 15th last season.",
      "\"You know what, when I look at him? Fair play, he looks a different player physically. I remember that night at Crystal Palace, he looks almost a stone lighter.",
      "\"To still be playing for Man United, he was never going to move on with the contract he's got, I think that's the thing with the deals since they last won the league title, that deal was a ridiculous one.",
      "\"It's not going to be renewed, that's the first area they look at bringing reinforcements in in January or the summer.\"",
      "Casemiro has emerged as an important player in Amorim's side, a stark contrast from when Carragher called for the Champions League-winner to \"call it a day\".",
      "The midfielder was targeted for criticism following a dismal display with Crystal Palace hitting four past Erik ten Hag's side. Michael Olise scored twice while Jean-Phillipe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell inflicted further misery on United.",
      "The triumph secured a first league double over United for Palace in two decades but compounded a dismal period for the Dutchman's side as it confirmed no European qualification for them.",

United will be hoping they can get a win following the defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday. The loss meant the Reds missed the chance to move up to fifth in the table, but due to playing before everyone else this weekend the opportunity is still there.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be without Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo for the fixture. Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are also missing but could return next Tuesday against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Casemiro is available having served his one-game suspension.",
      "MEN Sport has asked their United writers to pick their team for tonight's fixture under the lights.",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "United's squad is desperately stretched again and there are very few options available to Amorim to mix things up. There will be a temptation to bring Lisandro Martinez back but it's Leny Yoro's place that is vulnerable and the question has to be whether Martinez can play on the right, so for now that back three remains unchanged.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu are the only available wing-backs. In midfield, it has to be Manuel Ugarte in the deep role and then Casemiro next to him, but it's not a combination that inspires. Newcastle will fancy winning the midfield battle as they so often do against United.",
      "There aren't many attacking options either, so Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko go again. Cunha is at least in magnificent form at the moment.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Martinez was good from off the bench last weekend, but he played in midfield. I would stick with the same back three, although I would make a big change in midfield for this festive game.",
      "Ugarte is well below the standard required and I would give Jack Fletcher a chance to start alongside Casemiro. Ugarte was poor again at Villa Park and we've seen enough of him to suggest he's not at the level required.",
      "Fletcher's cameo was encouraging and it would be exciting to see what he can offer from the start.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "What will be concerning Amorim going into this game is who will be providing the creativity next to Casemiro. That's why moving Mount back should be tempting for United this Boxing Day.",
      "Replacing him in the No.10 role in this scenario would be Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has struggled at United but his better performances have come when he has played in a deeper role and not been asked to lead the line.",

      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "In his absence comes a chance for someone to step up and make themselves a hero, however.",

      "Manchester United could not return to winning ways against Aston Villa on Sunday. United suffered a 2-1 defeat after a brace from Morgan Rogers, who scored a goal in each half of the game.",
      "The Reds would have moved to fifth in the table if they had beaten Villa. They will now go into the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the top flight.",
      "Matheus Cunha brought the score level just before half-time, but Rogers is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League, and he punished United again following the interval.",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery reacted to the goal by throwing his coat in the air.",
      "Recap what happened at Villa Park here.",
      "Amorim insists United won't rip up their January transfer plans despite losing captain Fernandes to a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes joined fellow midfielder Mainoo on the injury list after he withdrew on the eve of the game.",
      "Fernandes clutched his hamstring late in the first half at Villa Park and was forced off at the break, with Amorim confirming it was a soft tissue problem. Mainoo injured his calf in training on Saturday and couldn't be part of the squad.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed. The Manchester United head coach could do with finding a couple of midfielders wrapped up, and no pair of socks will make up for the disappointment of not finding Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton ready to pop out of a box.",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United were unlikely to sign a midfielder in January, but then he didn't expect to finish the game at Aston Villa with Lisandro Martinez and Jack Fletcher in the middle of the pitch. Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",
      "Having seen Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, he saw Kobbie Mainoo limp out of training on Saturday and Bruno Fernandes pull up at the end of the first half. Casemiro's suspension left the outmatched Manuel Ugarte as the only senior midfielder left standing.",
      "Ugarte has fallen out of favour under Amorim, and at times at Villa Park, you could see why. His work in possession was particularly poor. He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Powerless to stop either goal and a solid enough game aside from that. One good first half stop from John McGinn, although might have pushed it wide of goal. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Awful for Rogers' first goal when he never made any attempt to get close to the brilliant playmaker. Looked scared to make a tackle for the second. 4",
      "Ayden Heaven: Stood up well to the challenge posed by an experienced England international. Some good moments against Ollie Watkins and edged that battle. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Saw play go down the other flank. Tidy enough in possession but didn't have an awful lot to do at times in the game. 6",

      "Zirkzee and Fletcher ON.",
      "Sesko and Ugarte OFF.",
      "Ugarte has been disappointing again this afternoon and was just handed a card.",
      "The atmosphere had settled in here, but Villa Park has really come alive again in the second half. The hosts have momentum and they are pushing to score another, which would provide a two-goal cushion.",

      "Cunha dances in front of the Villa fans after firing United back into the game.",
      "Fantastic response after falling behind. Dorgu records an assist.",
      "Awful from Yoro. Rogers gets that ball on the touchline and finishes from 15 yards out well inside the area, without any threat of a challenge. That is pathetic defending and all of United’s good work has been undone.",
      "That's a stunning goal from Rogers, who finds the top right corner from the left of the box.",
      "Ugarte was too weak and Yoro was hugely to blame when Rogers picked it up.",
      "Fernandes picked up a knock a few minutes ago but he has continued.",
      "United got to be happy with how things are going here. They’ve kept Villa quiet for a while now and look the better side at the moment. Starting to show some control, good spells of possession, Cunha looking lively and the Villa Park faithful starting to get really rattled.",
      "Cunha won the ball back and forced a save from Martinez, shooting from the edge of the box.",
      "Two chances fall to Sesko in quick succession and he should do better. First one is a good save from Martinez, but elite strikers would want to be scoring that. Second is the wrong option, touch round the goalkeeper wasn’t on and should have looked to lift it. A promising sign that he is suddenly in the game, however.",
      "Villa made a fast start to this game, but they've dropped off and some of the fans around the press box are beginning to sound frustrated.",
      "Sesko latched onto a ball into the box and should have done a lot better.",
      "Mount offering some advice to Sesko during a break in play. Striker feeding on scraps at the moment, but he is at least offering an outball. Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",
      "Mount has just been shaking his head - he doesn't look happy with the speed United are playing at.",
      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence."

He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, is going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me for the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone.

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",

United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",

      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "According to reports, one potential Manchester United signing in January is already ‘off’, while three players ‘could quit’ the Premier League giants.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Man Utd were busy in this summer’s transfer window as they made wholesale changes to their squad after finishing 15th in the Premier League last season and failing to win a trophy.",
      "The Red Devils spent around £230m on signings as they overhauled their attack and signed a new goalkeeper. Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens were their most notable additions.",
      "This business has helped to improve Ruben Amorim‘s side, but it is clear that they still need upgrades in various positions.",
      "This is particularly the case in midfield, but they could also do with signing further attacking reinforcements to increase their depth.",
      "Man Utd were linked with Antoine Semenyo, but they are having to look elsewhere as he has opted to join Manchester City in January.",
      "READ: Big Christmas Weekend: Chelsea v Aston Villa, Man City, Mason Mount, Thomas Frank",
      "Currently, RB Leipzig standout Yan Diomande appears to be their favoured option, though it has also been reported that Liverpool have submitted a ‘request’ to hijack a possible deal.",
      "However, journalist Graeme Bailey has told our pals at TEAMtalk that a ‘January deal is off’ between Man Utd and Diomande because RB Leipzig are keen for him to stay beyond January.",
      "A source for the outlet said: “As a club, and organisation, Diomande is held in the highest regard. There is no release clause, he won’t be leaving in January – that can be confirmed.",
      "“There is a lot of interest from England, that is true, but also Italy, Spain and in Germany – but that is not a shock.",
      "“Red Bull has previously had the likes of Erling Haaland, Timo Werner, Dayot Upamecano, Sadio Mane – there are no worries about handling Diomande’s situation.”",
      "There are expected to be further exits from Old Trafford next year, with football finance expert Stefan Borson explaining why Marcus Rashford, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are three particular players who ‘could quit’ in 2026.",
      "“On the cash side of things, they’re going to need cash,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“They’ve got a few players that they can probably expect to sell. You would expect Rashford to go, which will bring in let’s say £25-30m, so that’ll be positive.",
      "“You would think they will start saving some money because some of these big earners will go. Casemiro in particular will go at the end of the season. There are players like Mainoo that will also help on that side of things.”",
      "Borson added: “Ultimately, they may well need some money to be put in by the ownership group because they’re probably getting to the point where they’re maxed out on the debt side of things.",
      "“You’re going to have a situation where either INEOS dilute down the existing holdings of the Glazers, or the Glazers and INEOS are forced to put money in. We’ve talked about this before, people have mocked the possibility of the Glazers ever putting money in.",
      "“But ultimately, you’ve got to pay the bills and United are at risk here of starting to need more cash.”",

      "According to reports, Al Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves wants to leave Saudi Arabia and has interest from three Premier League clubs, including Manchester United.",
      "Neves joined Al Hilal from Wolves in a club-record sale worth around £47million in June 2023.",
      "The 28-year-old was linked with a host of European clubs, including Man United and Barcelona, before landing in Saudi Arabia.",
      "As is the case with most players his age, it never felt like Neves’ long-term future was in the Middle East and, two-and-a-half years later, he is reportedly keen to return to Europe.",
      "Neves’ contract expires at the end of the season and a renewal looks unlikely.",
      "Man United have been linked with the Portugal international again, with Real Madrid also mentioned, but Galatasaray, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have now been added to the mix.",
      "According to Sabah in Turkey (via Sport Witness), Al Hilal do not want to lose Neves on a free and the three Premier League clubs are on red alert.",
      "The report says United, Spurs and Newcastle are all providing ‘significant and strong competition’ and are ‘preparing offers’ expected to be submitted during the January transfer window.",
      "With Neves’ contract set to expire in June, he is not expected to cost more than £22m, though a fee as low as £15m is not ruled out.",
      "Neves would be a brilliant signing for Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "There may be concerns about whether Neves has the legs to cover ground relentlessly for United, but his technical quality is not up for debate.",

      "United need a player who can dictate play while also contributing defensively, which is exactly the sort of midfielder required to play alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Neves could elevate Fernandes’ game to another level, which is quite frightening given the captain is already producing in such an inconsistent and underperforming team.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, already have Sandro Tonali operating in the No.6 role, but he could potentially move further forward in a tactical switch similar to Declan Rice’s role at Arsenal.",
      "There might be concerns about a lack of goals from a midfield trio of Neves, Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes, but it would still be a very strong unit.",
      "If Tonali can become what Rice has been for Arsenal as a No.8, Newcastle’s season could turn positive after a miserable first half of 2025/26.",
      "Joelinton appears to be on the decline and a natural replacement for him may be more of a priority than a deep-lying playmaker like Neves. That said, if Eddie Howe sees Tonali further up the pitch, signing the Portuguese midfielder could prove a masterstroke.",
      "Spurs would be silly not to seriously compete for Neves’ signature as well. They desperately need more quality in midfield and their No.6 options are limited offensively.",
      "Joao Palhinha is a brilliant player, but he is not someone capable of unlocking defences or dictating the tempo of a match. Neves can do both.",
      "In truth, Spurs need anyone capable of improving their starting XI. They are currently 14th in the Premier League and Thomas Frank is under serious pressure.",

      "The Portugal international has only missed two club matches through injury in his professional career, but is set to be absent for around a month.",
      "It’s a huge blow for United, who only know life with their captain in the starting XI. It will be interesting to see how they cope without him. They will either crumble, or, for no reason other than football being very weird at times, look significantly better.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the natural choice to replace Fernandes, but he is also injured.",
      "It’s typical of the young midfielder’s season, which has been stop-start and frustrating. Mainoo knows he is competing against Fernandes for a starting spot rather than alongside him.",
      "Dislodging the United skipper is an impossible task and his injury should have presented the perfect opportunity for Mainoo to finally stake his claim under Amorim.",
      "Instead, the United boss is without both and could move Mason Mount back into midfield to play alongside Casemiro, although centre-back Lisandro Martinez came off the bench to feature there at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim has to find a solution, but you can’t blame him for being a little tentative.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Amorim said: “It’s impossible to replace Bruno. But I said that this morning to the team that we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing in that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "“It’s not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can’t rely on one player for everything.",
      "“Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad [Diallo] on set-pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "“This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw and all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.”",
      "Young midfielder Jack Fletcher, son of United hero Darren, came off the bench against Villa and is one of the options Amorim is considering.",
      "“We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing,” he said.",
      "“I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job and that’s why, when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "“I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players at this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust my players. If we are really focused on the game, we can win.”",
      "So, who replaces Fernandes in the United midfield?",
      "A Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte pairing seriously lacks creativity and, in the latter’s case, quality.",
      "Ugarte is short on confidence and has struggled every time he has taken to the pitch this season, with most of his appearances coming from the bench.",
      "He started against Villa last weekend and could start again if Amorim believes continuity is required to restore his form.",
      "But with Newcastle looking far less combative and physical in midfield, there is little need to pair the two South Americans.",
      "Fletcher is an option, but it will likely be Mount who starts alongside Casemiro, who returns from suspension to face the Magpies.",
      "Mount has impressed in recent weeks in a more advanced role, but he is perfectly capable of dropping deeper to perform a similar function to Fernandes.",
      "Mason Mount’s impact for Manchester United this season 🔴 pic.twitter.com/k9slPwA1FV",
      "He has the engine, tactical awareness and set-piece delivery to do as good a job as any in the middle of the park. It will be a big test, but one he is capable of passing.",
      "Mount could thrive in a starring role rather than a supporting one, and a top performance against Newcastle could put him firmly on England boss Thomas Tuchel’s radar, if he isn’t already.",
      "Mount dropping deeper, combined with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo being away at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaves question marks over Amorim’s front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is expected to start up front, with Matheus Cunha in behind him. The final attacking spot is up for grabs and will probably go to Joshua Zirkzee, with young striker Chido Obi the only other first-team option.",

      "The one game we are being allowed by the wokerati on Boxing Day is at least a good one, and the following couple of days do have some belters to be fair. Including – again, as should be law at this time of year – a couple of potential opportunities to deploy the word ‘sack’ in whimsical fashion to refer to both Santa’s preferred if archaic toy delivery method and the fate of a couple of under-fire managers.",

      "",
      "Always looked like it would be the most significant game in the title race over the festive weekend, but only in the last few weeks has it become clear that this is because of Aston Villa’s involvement and not Chelsea’s.",
      "It is, obviously, a huge test of Villa’s stickability; Chelsea may have meekly surrendered their own chances in self-fulfilling fashion once again, but they remain a tough test for a team trying to compete with two giants in Arsenal and Man City.",
      "The actual dynamic of this Saturday evening affair will inevitably be coloured by what Man City and Arsenal themselves have done earlier in the day. Fair to say Villa would at this point settle for a retention of the status quo in terms of their gap to the top two.",
      "And without wishing to pour any rain on Villa’s current parade, it does still bear mentioning that as the second half of the season pans out there is still the possibility/probability that Chelsea emerge as more significant rivals to Villa than the top two anyway in terms of Champions League qualification.",
      "Villa currently lead Enzo Maresca’s side by seven points and while sprinting to keep up with the top two isn’t doing Unai and the lads any harm right now it does feel like a day where, even for a team with 11 wins from their last 12 Premier League games, a draw would be absolutely fine and not in any way necessarily a momentum killer.",
      "",
      "Villa are obviously the best team in the country right now, but for the first time in a good while it’s looking like Man City might be second best. They’re certainly playing more convincing football than Arsenal right now, and have another chance to briefly leapfrog their main title rivals and put pressure on a potentially ticklish home game for Arsenal against a Brighton side who so often relish the chance to mess with the bigger boys.",
      "But in order to apply that pressure City must take care of their own business against Sean Dyche’s Nottingham Forest, a team that can’t quite be described as resurgent but is definitely no longer the pushover of the brief but hilarious Angeball days.",
      "They’ve been alternating between victory and defeat for the last six Premier League games, and the bad news for City is that they’ll arrive at the City Ground at the wrong point in that particular pattern.",
      "The good news for City is that they aren’t currently alternating anything having won each of their last five Premier League games, the last three of them by 3-0 margins and with 17 goals in total across those five games. Which, even after the 3-0 paddling of Tottenham the other week, is still the total number of Premier League goals Forest have managed all season.",
      "",
      "We may only have one Premier League game on Boxing Day, because of woke, but it is at least a good one as the tentatively improving Man United take on a frustrating Newcastle side whose season still awaits any kind of real lift-off.",
      "The big news for the home side, of course, is how they fare without Bruno Fernandes. He isn’t the actual most irreplaceable player in the league, because that probably is still just Erling Haaland because of sheer weight of numbers, but his combination of vital importance and until now impeccable reliability does give this some real heft.",
      "This is a player who basically plays all of the football for Man United, and there’s a certain irony that his first vaguely serious injury in five years has come right at the start of the busiest time of the quietest season.",
      "But every crisis is an opportunity, and now for the first time in his United career we get the chance to see Mason Mount cast in a starring rather than supporting role.",
      "For him, the timing does seem rather good. He has in recent weeks been playing the best football he’s produced since leaving Chelsea and has already proved he can do a job playing alongside United’s undisputed star man.",
      "Now he must show he can pull the strings in Bruno’s absence, or all the hints of recovery for both United and Mount himself over the last couple of months could be washed away before January is through.",
      "",
      "The current favourite in the Sack Race takes on the current favourite to replace him as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham travel to Crystal Palace for a real melon-twister of a game.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s departure for somewhere shinier than Palace has long felt inevitable, but it wouldn’t do at all for them to lose him to somewhere as ropey as Spurs. So Palace need to tread carefully here, making sure to win, obviously, but not in such a way as to hasten Frank’s demise.",
      "Luckily, Liverpool have given them the perfect blueprint for how to be alarmingly bad but still beat Spurs.",
      "Frank is, clearly, in very deep trouble. The fallout from that vaguely absurd game against Liverpool in which Spurs played better with 10 men and then better still with nine means he has to try and engineer a result at Selhurst Park without both Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero. Both let him down badly on Saturday in inconsistent seasons, and this doesn’t look like a moment in which Spurs or Frank can afford to have both their attack and defence weakened in this manner.",
      "Frank has already survived one encounter with his former club Brentford that had the possibility to end his Tottenham reign. But if he leaves Selhurst Park with the result we suspect, then the New Year trip to his old patch will carry old problems.",
      "There was mitigation and even encouragement from the performance even in defeat against Liverpool, but that won’t fly in the next couple of games. He’s got to find a result in one of these two games surely. And even that may be no more than delaying the now inevitable.",
      "",
      "Unlike the ultra-woke, Christmas-cancelling Premier League, the Football League is delivering a full sack of Boxing Day fixtures to enjoy with your turkey sandwiches, Rennies and hangover.",

      "Stoke v Preston is one, with the Potters looking to arrest their recent slide while for Preston the recent issue has been too many draws in a six-match unbeaten run.",
      "The pick, though, looks to be Millwall v Ipswich, because third v sixth with third place up for grabs is always a particularly delicious dynamic for a Championship fixture at any time of the season.",
      "",
      "God bless Serie A for carrying on even though it’s Christmas, and also this season for delivering what looks certain to be the best title race across Europe’s big leagues. We still here have a top five separated by just four points and after a bad couple of weeks for Bologna and Como it does seem now to have crystallised into a scrap between five big guns.",
      "It’s currently all rather neat, with Inter top on 33 points and stacked up at one-point increments behind them come Milan, Napoli, Roma and Juventus.",
      "The Christmas weekend doesn’t pit any of the contenders in direct conflict, but Inter’s trip to Atalanta does look as good a choice as any.",
      "Essentially, absent a clear standout fixture for any of those title contenders, if you’re picking one game Inter are generally the safest bet on the entertainment front. They’ve conceded more goals than anyone else in the top eight bar Juventus (by a single goal) but with 34 goals in their 15 games thus far are 10 goals clear of anyone else."

My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",

      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has criticised “ridiculous” former team-mate Mark Bosnich for being “so unprofessional” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have been through many poor signings just in the past decade with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Casemiro among the names to arrive for big money and contribute less than their price tag would promise.",
      "Former Man Utd flops Juan Sebastian Veron, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Angel di Maria, Diego Forlan and others will go down as some of the worst deals in the clubs history – but Scholes reckons Bosnich is up there due to his “unprofessional” nature.",
      "When suggested that Veron was the Red Devils’ worst-ever signing, Scholes replied on The Overlap: “Veron was a great player, a talented player. Don’t really know why it didn’t work for him but what a footballer.",
      "“I go back to the goalkeepers, when you had to try and replace Peter Schmeichel, which is always going to be difficult.",
      "“We had a few. I was thinking [Massimo] Taibi, Mark Bosnich.",
      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "“I thought he was a good keeper at Villa, Mark. He came to us, he was so unprofessional. Honestly, it was ridiculous.",
      "“In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he’s knackered, ‘oh no, get someone else in’.",
      "“I never realised, he couldn’t kick a football. I’ve never seen anything like it. We played Everton away in first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it, he couldn’t reach the halfway line.",
      "“There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly he was just kicking the floor all the time, big flippers. Honestly, it was disappointing.”",
      "In Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson also branded Bosnich – who came through the youth ranks at Man Utd – “a terrible professional”.",
      "On Bosnich, who played 38 times in two spells for Man Utd, Ferguson said: “Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known.",
      "“The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "“We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "“I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, ‘Alex, I’m sorry, I’ve shaken hands with Bosnich.’ That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark’s hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.”",
      "When asked about Ferguson’s comments about him, the former Man Utd goalkeeper told FourFourTwo: “It wasn’t unfair – it was just a lie.",
      "“He’s always said that he doesn’t bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he’s got good evidence to back himself up. At that time, though, it was a lie.",
      "“Alex Ferguson signed me twice. I wouldn’t be talking to you now about my career unless he had taken a chance on me originally. Yes, we had a falling out, but these things happen. He was a great manager to play under.”",

      "As a Christmas treat we always like to revisit our pre-season predictions to get a sneak peek at who is on the way to looking utterly clueless.",
      "The full pre-season predictions are here if you want to have a proper laugh, or we will pick out the highlights…",
      "Starting – as is traditional – with the Premier League champions, this was bold from the boss (me): ‘Not Arsenal. Not having that.’ So guess who is very, very invested in the Gunners f***ing this up as they traditionally do from being top at Christmas.",
      "Dave Tickner was the only F365-er who actually tipped Arsenal, while Matt Stead and Ian Watson also plumped for Manchester City. The rest are already out of the race by tipping Liverpool and Chelsea; this was back in the days when we were dreaming of a four-horse title race.",
      "The top four, which nobody ever gets right? Every single one of us went for a combination of last season’s top four, with Lewis Oldham adding to his Liverpool title prediction with this beauty: ‘Chelsea. Arsenal. Manchester City. Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "Arsenal sit top of the table at Christmas for the fifth time in the Premier League era; they have never won the title from this position!",
      "Only Liverpool have been top of the Premier League at Christmas more times and failed to get over the line.",
      "They join Manchester United (twice), Newcastle (twice), Norwich, Aston Villa and Leeds United in knowing the pain of getting over-excited over the turkey only to end the season empty handed, and some of those collapses have been rather spectacular.",
      "Here’s 10 of the worst from the past 33 years, including a handful of particularly notable ones from the lower leagues.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – 2003/04 (Premier League)\nUnited at least had the excuse of going up against Arsenal’s Invincibles, but the depth of United’s post-Christmas drop-off was surprising for a Sir Alex Ferguson side nonetheless.",
      "They had lost just three times before Christmas, with a goalless draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford the only time they had shared the spoils, putting them a point ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea on Christmas Day.",
      "But United dropped points more often than they won them from there: their post-Christmas record was W10, D5, L6, with a 4-1 defeat to away to struggling Manchester City particularly painful, especially as it left Fergie’s side with just two wins in eight games. United ended up finishing third, 15 points adrift of unbeaten Arsenal.",
      "",
      "9) Norwich City – 1992/93 (Premier League)\nTitle-less Norwich had also been top on Christmas Day 1988, only to end up finishing third behind Arsenal and Liverpool. Well, this time it was going to be different! Except, erm, no, it wasn’t.",
      "The Canaries learned nothing from the warning they had provided themselves on their previous trip to the coal mine, and in fact their collapse began just before Christmas: they didn’t win any of their six games between their loss at Old Trafford on 12th December and their 1-1 draw at home to Coventry on 16th January.",
      "Mike Walker’s side remained in indifferent mid-table form for the rest of the campaign, bizarrely alternating between impressive victories and crushing high-scoring defeats. Norwich ended up finishing 12 points behind Manchester United in third – and, very weirdly, with a negative goal difference to boot.",
      "",
      "8) Leeds United – 1999/00 (Premier League)\nLeeds were two points clear at top for the last Christmas of the 20th century (yeah, yeah, shut up, ‘the millennium was actually 2001′ pedants, nobody likes you) partly because they had a game in hand over Manchester United, but again , it’s the sheer depths they sank to from there that makes it notable.",
      "After shrugging off early-season defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, David O’Leary’s Leeds had been almost unstoppable. Only Everton and Wimbledon succeeded in getting anything off them in an impressive run up to and including Boxing Day, with Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell particular stars.",
      "But things immediately nosedived after that: Leeds lost four of their next six, including six-pointers against fellow title hopefuls Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Three straight wins in March briefly revived Leeds’ hopes of pushing Ferguson’s men all the way – they had just four points to make up in their last nine games – but they promptly lost four in a row to put themselves dead in the water and ended up third, some 22 points off the pace.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds United – 2018/19 (Championship)\nAnd what a lovely way to segue to the EFL section of our list. It was Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds this time, and again they were one point clear at the top of the second tier on Christmas Day with exactly half the season’s games played. More importantly for their automatic promotion prospects, they were six ahead of third-placed West Brom.",
      "We’re going to resist the temptation to put their decline down to the infamous spygate incident, not least because Leeds actually lost both their last game of 2018 at home to bottom-half Hull and their New Year’s Day fixture away to Nottingham Forest. Yet despite looking far more fragile and, frankly, knackered than in the first half of the season, Leeds remained in the top two. With just four games to go Bielsa’s side were still in second place, three points clear of third-placed Sheffield United.",
      "Their fixture list was extremely inviting, too: encounters against 21st-placed Wigan, 15th-placed Brentford, fifth-placed Aston Villa, and rock-bottom Ipswich. They got a decent point against Villa, but contrived to lose the other three. That meant Leeds finished six points away from automatic promotion; narrative dictated they must then lose to Derby in the play-off semi finals.",
      "",
      "6) Portsmouth – 2020/21 (League One)\nThat season behind closed doors is one we’d all collective like to forget, but nobody more so than Portsmouth. They led an extremely tight third-tier table on Christmas Day on goal difference and having played a game more than second-placed Lincoln City, but their credentials were supported by Pompey having the best record in the division in both the goals for and goals against columns.",
      "But an abysmal run that started with a four-goal defeat at home to Hull in late January saw Portsmouth plummet to 10th by March, costing manager Kenny Jackett his job.",
      "Hopes of a reviving the season just enough to claim a play-off spot were briefly awakened as new appointment Danny Cowley led Pompey to four wins right off the bat, but they won just two more of their remaining eight games and ended up in eighth place, two points shy of the top six.",
      "",
      "5) Huddersfield Town – 1999/00 (Championship, as it wasn’t called then)\nEnglish football’s first three-in-a-row champions had spent 27 years outside the top flight by the time they sat top of the tree for Christmas 1999, thanks in no small part to Marcus Stewart’s superb form in front of goal.",
      "Steve Bruce’s Terriers won just one game in January and February, however, and compounded their slide to fifth place by unexpectedly selling Stewart to fourth-placed Ipswich Town on 1st February.",
      "Stewart would, naturally, score the winner against Huddersfield less than two weeks later, then help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion via the play-offs; Huddersfield weren’t even involved, having finished the season in eighth place. Stewart scored 19 Premier League goals the following season as Ipswich finished a brilliant fifth; Huddersfield were meanwhile relegated to the third tier. So that worked out well.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool – 1996/97 (Premier League)\nAlright then, back to the Premier League from here, we reckon. And again we return to the 1990s, when a lot of the time you could win titles with a points tally in the 70s. Liverpool were well on course for that by Christmas 1996, when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with 2 Become 1 and the Spice Boys were top of the Premier League. Unfortunately for them, 1 Became 4.",
      "It wasn’t any one extended run of especially awful form that did for them – they never went more than two games without a win – but more a general inability to string together a convincing run of victories: they only did so once in the second half the season, in fact, winning three in a row in January-February.",
      "A series of David James blunders was particularly costly for Roy Evans’ side, whose title hopes were effectively killed off by a 3-1 defeat at home to eventual champions Manchester United with just three games left to play. Newcastle and Arsenal snuck in ahead of the Reds on goal difference on the final day, to boot, leaving Liverpool to finish fourth in a two-horse race.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa – 1998/99 (Premier League)\nIt’s always remarkable to look back on Manchester United’s treble-winning season and remember just how easily they could have ended up completely empty-handed. Case in point: it was John Gregory’s Aston Villa, not United, who sat top of the table on Christmas Day that season.",
      "It didn’t last long: Villa were displaced by a defeat away to Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day, returned very briefly by beating Sheffield Wednesday, then never reclaimed top spot as they embarked on a genuinely miserable second half of the season as Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim’s brilliant goalscoring form dried up.",
      "Villa took just 12 points from their final 16 games of the season, with their only three wins in that run all coming in a vain and far-belated burst of late-season form. They were already down to sixth by that point, and three straight losses to finish the season ensured that was where they finished.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – 2013/14 (Premier League)\nAh, god, do we really need to recap this one? It takes such a high position not because Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were miles ahead at Christmas, because they weren’t: they were only top on goal difference and just two points ahead of fifth-placed Everton.",
      "Nor is it because Liverpool were notably awful in the second half of the campaign: they were the joint-second best team in the division from Boxing Day onwards, too, dropping just four points between between game 20 on New Year’s Day and game 35 in mid-April.",
      "But come on. You can’t make any list of title capitulations without including Liverpool 2013/14. This does not slip (which he did). Another Istanbul (which they were on the receiving end of from Crystal Palace). Comedy gold.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – 1995/96 (Premier League)\nA brilliant failure that may never be topped. Ten points. Ten bloody points clear, Newcastle were. Ten points at Christmas. They’d been top of the table since beating Coventry 3-0 on the opening day and would stay there until close to the end of March. In the bag.",
      "Except that having been dodgy as owt going into Christmas, a Manchester United inspired by Eric Cantona’s return from his fan-kicky suspension were virtually flawless after opening their stockings (leave it), winning all but four of their games – starting with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle themselves.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, were very, very flawed, with Faustino Asprilla’s mid-season arrival bringing yet more flair to an already attacking side but leading Kevin Keegan to disastrously change shape to fit him in, while new midfield arrival David Batty failed to help matters.",
      "That famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield in early April was Newcastle’s fourth defeat in six games, and the upturn in their form that followed was too late: Manchester United had overtaken them, and made sure the title was sealed on points rather than goal difference by winning their final two games while Newcastle were only able to draw theirs."

      "“Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it, whether we are going to change shape. I’m not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed.",

      "“The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that’s a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they’re playing regularly.",

      "Semenyo had become a brilliant market opportunity for many clubs with the Bournemouth winger available in January for £65m, due to a release clause in his contract.",
      "But The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealed on Tuesday that Semenyo’s ‘preference is to move to Manchester City in January’ after months of speculation.",
      "It is his ‘desire to win trophies’ that led him to the decision and on Man Utd, Ornstein added: ‘Manchester United also tried their best to sign the forward, but a move in January was always going to be a stretch and the club only wished to bring in players who are eager to join.’",
      "And now a reliable X account has claimed that Man Utd have now ‘made contact’ over a move for RB Leipzig star Diomande as they look to land an alternative to Semenyo.",

      "Manchester United often don’t even bother with the January transfer window, perhaps scarred by the memory of their worst signing of the post-Ferguson era. But it also prompted their very best…",
      "United are reported to be in the market for January recruits, though they appear to have missed out on Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If they sign another forward before midfielder, frankly, the club should be folded. But reports suggest they could also be in the market for Ruben Neves. Which, unless he leaves his legs in Saudi, seems like a good idea.",
      "As did most of these January signings. Even this fella at no.10…",
      "",
      "Rated on these pages as the worst of all the post-Fergie signings, which is really quite an achievement when you consider your Di Marias, your Sanchos, your Pogbas. But Sanchez admitted he wanted to quit United and return to Arsenal after only his first training session. Sadly for him and United, there was no return policy on the £35million swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the Gunners.",
      "Then the highest-paid player ever in the Premier League, Sanchez stuck it out for 32 league appearances, scoring three goals while barely hiding his contempt for his surroundings.",
      "In fairness to United, no one saw it going this badly wrong when he was tinkling the ivories for his unveiling video. In Sanchez, they had signed one of the Premier League’s best players. But, even by United standards, the immediate slump in the Chilean’s output once he walked through the Old Trafford door was damning on all concerned. In the end, they had to pay him millions just to f*** off, which was far better value than the millions they paid him to play.",
      "",
      "At Barcelona, Valdes won everything in one of the greatest teams of all time. So it was quite striking to see him as barely a bit-part at United after he signed for 18 months as a freebie for Louis van Gaal in January 2015.",
      "Valdes played two games for United, serving as understudy to compatriot David De Gea before p*ssing off Van Gaal to the extent he wasn’t allowed to train even with the youth team or allowed a locker for his Rolex while he worked out alone with an academy goalkeeping coach.",
      "",
      "Arriving on loan from Palace in January 2023, ex-England stopper Butland was just one of a few odd goalkeeper signings made by United, replacing another in Martin Dubravka. At least Dubravka got his gloves dirty twice. Butland never made it off the bench for the club he supported as a boy, even if he took an FA Cup runners-up medal back to Palace with him.",
      "",
      "The Netherlands international is widely derided on the basis that he failed to score a Premier League goal in his half-season at Old Trafford. Which isn’t a good look for a centre-forward.",
      "But after a loan switch from Burnley, with the Clarets splitting £3million with Besiktas, Weghorst endeared himself to the United faithful just by running around a bit and showing an appetite to be there. That’s how low the bar was for a fanbase fed up of watching Anthony Martial’s mard-arse saunter around Old Trafford.",
      "He scored two cup goals, won the Carabao Cup and generally seemed to relish his big opportunity. But, enthusiastic though he was, he was never likely to be the top-class striker Erik ten Hag needed.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag had to hurriedly spin through his Rolodex during the final days of the January 2023 transfer window as soon as it emerged that Christian Eriksen would be out for three months after bumping into Andy Carroll in a bad mood.",
      "As the first Austrian to play for United, Sabitzer scored three goals in 18 appearances and had a hand in the Carabao Cup triumph by coming off the bench in the final against Newcastle. When his loan was up, everyone concerned seemed pretty non-plussed about the prospect of making it a longer-term arrangement. He did okay but his impact was negligible.",
      "In the end, Sabitzer returned to Bayern Munich before being sold to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "",
      "United’s move for Ighalo in January 2020 sparked a new genre of transfer: an Ighalo-type move, one defined as late, desperate and short-term. See: Weghorst.",
      "In that sense, Ighalo served his purpose. Arriving from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, he bagged five goals in 19 appearances in the Covid season to earn a six-month extension before heading off to Al Shabab to complete the lucrative CSL-Pro League double bubble.",
      "MORE FROM F365: Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle among top 10 storylines we weren’t expecting in 2025",
      "The jury is still out on Dorgu but a year on from his arrival from Lecce, a verdict is surely imminent. Frankly, though, it doesn’t look encouraging. And the slim possibility that he might yet come good means he ranks higher than his performances so far merit.",
      "The Denmark international is still only 21 with less senior experience than many peers of a similar age so it was unfair to expect him to hit the ground running. But it is hard to identify many redeeming features in the left wing-back. He’s quick, sure. But can you recall him giving many opposition full-backs a hard time? There is certainly little encouragement to be found in a record of no goals and three assists in 37 appearances. Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing but wing-backs on both sides are among the areas United are still considered weakest.",
      "",
      "The spectacle of club-record signing Mata being choppered into Carrington to join United in January 2014 summed up the post-Fergie United. Or rather the post-David Gill United. The Woodward United.",
      "Not that any of that was Mata’s fault. And for much of his career at United, the former Spain playmaker was a pleasure to watch. Never more than in March 2015 at Juanfield. And the fact he’s a good egg did him no harm, even if he rarely dragged United to new heights as one might expect of a creative record signing.",
      "Mata spent seven and a half years at Old Trafford, scoring 51 goals in 285 appearances, winning four trophies. Never the big ones, but United haven’t been in a position to be sniffy about silverware.",
      "The Diallo deal was arranged in October 2020 to be completed the following January. And for a while, it looked like more money down the drain when the winger struggled to make a first-team breakthrough. A loan move to Sunderland went much better than an earlier stint at Rangers and eventually, three years after he joined, Amad began to get some regular minutes in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ten Hag was binned, Amad was expected to be one of the players to profit from Amorim’s appointment and the sudden need for wing-backs. Indeed, were it not for an ankle injury last season, he would be in the top three players with most minutes under Amorim. Amad can play as wing-back or as one of the wide forwards. He probably prefers the latter but is needed more as the former.",
      "",
      "Quite simply the best signing of the post-Fergie era, be it the summer or winter window.",
      "Fernandes has been the single consistent bright spot on a rather bleak landscape since he arrived from Sporting Lisbon pre-Covid in 2020. Immediately dismiss the opinion of anyone who pushes the claim that Fernandes has been ‘a problem’, or indeed anything but the best, most creative signing of the last dozen years. Imagine how bad United would have been without him.",
      "It’s not another symbol of Broken Britain but it is sad that there will be only one Premier League game on Boxing Day.",
      "Alexander Isak has *finally* broken his silence on his injury four days ago, but Liverpool need not worry because a perfect replacement has been identified.",
      "There is anger at the notion that Alexander Isak’s leg break was karma and not a lot else in the pre-Christmas Mailbox.",
      "Liverpool’s frustration at Alexander Isak’s injury is obvious and understandable, but there is no villain in this story and no justice to be served.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications."

      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "The Red Devils paid out around £74m to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd spent almost all of their budget on attacking players with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also joining, while Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were the other summer arrivals.",
      "Sesko has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and playing for Man Utd, with the Slovenia international contributing two goals and one assist in 14 matches in all competitions.",
      "And Parker wonders whether Man Utd ever sent any scouts to go and watch Sesko as they are failing to play to the 22-year-old’s strengths.",
      "The former Man Utd defender exclusively told Football365 in association with gambling portal British Gambler: “You look at Benjamin Sesko and the goals he’s scored, it makes me wonder whether Manchester United sent anyone to actually watch him play. When he was at Leipzig, there were lots of balls coming into the box and those big-angle passes being hit at him from deep for him to run onto.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Tottenham freakout, assorted flops – 10 of the 2025 storylines we DID see coming",
      "“He was scoring all kinds of goals there, and at United they’re feeding him breadcrumbs. The players behind him aren’t giving him opportunities so he’s having to do a lot of the work himself which is of course expected, you have to give a little bit back sometimes.",
      "“That was Rasmus Hojlund’s issue, too. He struggled in the Premier League because he wasn’t fed enough, but also agility-wise and quickness of feet, they were reasons he struggled, too. That’s why he’s been given the opportunity to flourish in the Serie A because the pace of that league is no where near the speed of the Premier League.”",
      "It’s unlikely that England will take many Man Utd players to the World Cup but Parker has addressed the media narrative surrounding former Old Trafford transfer target Jude Bellingham, who now stars for Real Madrid and the Three Lions.",
      "Parker added: “If you’re going on current form, Morgan Rogers should be starting ahead of Jude Bellingham for England next summer at the World Cup. When you play with England you try and make everything as close to a club’s scenario as possible.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Bruno Fernandes limp exclusive as Antoine Semenyo decision YESTERDAY",
      "“The issue is that the media have been so pivotal in driving Bellingham’s narrative. The media have been pushing Bellingham since the Euros to make it all about him. When you look at Rogers, he’s that one player in the team who’s allowed to go wherever he wants, he often comes in from the left-hand side to score goals.",
      "“I love what Rogers is doing for Villa but also what Eberechi Eze did for Crystal Palace when he played a similar role. Eze was outstanding at that time and I think he was the best in the Premier League in that position last season.",
      "“I think that freedom has been taken away from him by Mikel Arteta since going to Arsenal. They bought him for what he was delivering and then when they got him, they’ve tried to get him to do something different. It doesn’t make sense for that kind of money.",
      "“Cole Palmer is another vying for that role and he’s good in the big games. He’s proven that for club and country already. It’s about him getting the games back under his belt after his injury, but for me he’s the most standout player. He plays off the cuff, not that Rogers and Eze don’t, but Palmer stands out the most, the issue is there that he’s got a manager who’s still trying to school him.”",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",

      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort."

      "If anyone has spent this season reminding people just what they are capable of, it's Mason Mount.",
      "The Manchester United midfielder has been plagued by setbacks in recent years, whether that be injuries, tough results or being shown the door by Chelsea, a club he had spent 18 years at.",
      "To overcome so many hurdles is not easy, but Mount puts his resilience down to his early years of chasing his dream to become a professional footballer.",
      "\"I think in my younger years, I didn't have loads of downs. I was very lucky to play in very good teams where we won a lot.",
      "\"Then as you get older, you understand there's definitely going to be ups and downs. And the downs that I experienced was losing big games or losing a final.",
      "\"That's definitely something that you have to learn about, you have to overcome.\"",
      "Mount is a little over a year removed from what appeared to be one of his lowest moments in a United shirt. Backed by new manager Ruben Amorim to start in a Manchester derby against City, he lasted just 12 minutes before being taken off through injury.",
      "It was another fitness blow for Mount, who looked crestfallen as he walked off with the United physios.",
      "\"It was very tough because, obviously, the manager had just come in,\" he recounts.",
      "\"I was getting into the team. When I felt it, I was like 'this is not going to be a good one'.",
      "\"It takes a couple of days to kind of get your head around that. But then for me, it was always, 'I'm back on it now, focus. What can I do to get back as quick as possible and in the best shape I can be?'\"",
      "His hard work has paid off, with Gary Neville saying during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa that the Red Devils are a better team with Mount in it. That assessment boils down to the hours Mount puts in to make it the case.",
      "\"There's a lot that people don't see, but within the group I think bringing that energy for myself and for the boys onto the pitch is super important.",
      "\"Seeing me start a press or pressing the goalkeeper when it's not on, but then it also sets a trigger for the rest of the lads to go.",
      "\"I've been used a bit higher up in a position that I'm used to. I can go forward, I can get into the box. Also, when we don't have the ball, I will drop in and help the lads in midfield.",
      "\"I think I'm getting close to really getting back to that [his best]. I think now with all my experience that I've got and experiences that I've been through, I think it [his best level] can be higher than before.",
      "\"Over the last couple of years, it's been difficult to get even close to that level. But now, I've had a really good pre-season and a lot of games. A lot of minutes in the legs. I feel like I'm getting close to being back.\"",
      "Should Mount reach the peak of his powers, some may begin thinking about booking him a ticket to North America next summer.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel knows Mount all too well, with the playmaker providing the assist for the winning goal as Tuchel's Chelsea lifted the Champions League in 2021.",
      "If Mount can continues to show his worth, the stars could very much align, but he isn't getting carried away just yet.",
      "\"I always say it starts with the club. If you're performing at the club, then you have an opportunity to get in the squad,\" he said when asked about his World Cup hopes.",
      "\"First and foremost, if we're doing well, if we're winning games, if we're pushing up the league, then there's always going to be that opportunity there.",
      "\"Obviously, I know Thomas. I know what he's all about. I'll be doing everything I can to get in that squad.\"",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called nine out of 10 match results correct last weekend. He is back to offer his insight...",
      "With key attacking absences likely to affect Manchester United's output, United will be looking towards Matheus Cunha to provide the creative and shooting threat.",
      "Repeatable patterns in betting are something to respect and Cunha's shooting profile is exactly that. No player since the start of last season has hit the target more often from outside the box than Cunha (31), which tells you this isn't variance, it's design. Even more encouraging, four of those outside-the-box shots on target have come in his last two games, highlighting current confidence and freedom in his role.",
      "Away from home, Eddie Howe's side concede 1.21 shots from outside the box per game across their last 30 away league matches, the third-most of any Premier League team. That's a defensive concession profile that invites exactly the type of effort Cunha specialises in.",
      "At Evens with Sky Bet for one or more Cunha shots on target from outside the box, you're not asking for a goal, just a clean connection that troubles the goalkeeper from outside the area.",
      "Manchester City are becoming the punters' pals again such has been their reliability. It's seven wins on the spin for Pep Guardiola's boys who have the scent of Arsenal in their nostrils.",
      "Guardiola is doing things differently too. Once famed for his rotation, over the last eight gameweeks, he has used fewer players (12) in his starting XI than any other Premier League manager. This is providing some great trends to develop across the props markets for us to follow, including the foul-drawing ability of Mathues Nunes for City. He's lured in nine fouls from the opposition in his last five starts and tops the charts for being City's most fouled player this season. He's 6/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls again.",
      "Taking the opposition shots lines against Arsenal at The Emirates isn't usually a betting theory to explore - but under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton are not a normal team when visiting the elite and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shots bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 11 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under this manager's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 15.8 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.78 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output. That is a title-contender chance creation from a side that isn't sniffing anywhere near a title challenge.",
      "The markets are behind on this curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "This is a game where it's hard to get away from the numbers. Let's hope they don't lie.",
      "Across Brentford's last 11 league games at the Gtech, we're seeing a hefty 3.9 goals per match, which immediately tells you two things: they're playing front-foot football and they're far from watertight at the back.",
      "Now add Bournemouth into the equation and the noise only gets louder. Their away games are averaging a remarkable 4.5 goals per match, which is elite-level volatility. Andoni Iraola has fully committed to an aggressive press on the road, and while it creates chances at one end, it leaves them horribly exposed at the other.",
      "If you combine both teams to score and over 2.5 goals you conjure up a 4/5 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "This is the part of the season where experience quietly tilts the balance. Fixtures come thick and fast, preparation time is limited and matches often hinge on game management rather than tactical perfection.",
      "That's where David Moyes stands out.",
      "Across 58 Premier League matches managed between December 23 and January 8, his teams have posted a 45 per cent win ratio, which is an impressive return during one of the most demanding stretches of the calendar. It points to a manager who understands how to simplify the game when legs are tired and focus shifts from style to substance.",
      "In a game likely decided by fine margins, backing experience, particularly on the touchline, feels like the sensible angle with Evens on offer for an away win.",
      "When you're playing at Anfield, long spells without the ball are inevitable. And when a team spends most of the game chasing shadows, the foul count usually starts to climb.",
      "That's the angle that makes Wolves interesting here in a very difficult betting heat. Since Rob Edwards took charge, they've been averaging 16.8 fouls per 90 minutes - the most of any team in the Premier League. Teams that expect to suffer tend to foul more, not out of malice, but frustration. And there is plenty of that in the Wolves camp.",
      "Wolves to make the most fouls in each half at 13/8 with Sky Bet is worth a look.",
      "Since Nuno Espírito Santo took charge at West Ham, their matches have taken on a very clear profile. We're seeing an average of exactly three goals per game, but the more telling metric is the expected goals figure, which sits even higher at 3.3 per match.",
      "That tells you these games aren't being inflated by freak finishes or red cards, the chances are genuinely flowing at both ends.",
      "Nuno's West Ham are far more direct and very transition-heavy. They attack quickly, commit bodies forward and are happy to take risks - something the home fans will be demanding in this important and winnable home fixture. The Hammers aren't trustworthy enough to back outright at 8/5 with Sky Bet but the over 2.5 goals and both teams to score combo at Evens is a price with possibilities.",
      "Aston Villa's underlying numbers suggest a bit of turbulence ahead. But context matters and this trip to Chelsea is one of those spots where Villa remain very hard to ignore despite the data warnings with 3/1 with Sky Bet on offer to make it 11 wins in a row.",
      "Chelsea still struggle to control games for long periods, especially against teams willing to attack space quickly. That's where Morgan Rogers comes to the party. Villa's main man doesn't need volume, he needs moments - and Chelsea provide plenty of those.",
      "A Villa win with Rogers on the scoresheet isn't too much to ask. It's landed in three of his last seven starts, meaning the 8/1 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "There are certain grounds you simply can't ignore. The Stadium of Light has become a place where structure, energy and belief do the heavy lifting, and those qualities tend to travel very well through a season. It's now eight Premier League home games unbeaten, with five wins and three draws and that consistency tells you plenty about what kind of team they are.",
      "With key players away at AFCON, there's a temptation to downgrade Sunderland. But this is a side built on collective understanding and tactical clarity. Remove a few pieces and the structure still holds - as shown in their excellent performance at Brighton.",
      "Leeds, meanwhile, have struggled badly on the road. Six defeats in eight away games paints a picture of a team that hasn't yet found a way to control matches outside familiar surroundings.",
      "The market is disrespecting the influence of the Stadium of Light resulting in us being able to back Sunderland on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace's defence is creaking. It's now 10 goals conceded in their last four games across all competitions. Before that, over the previous 12 matches they'd only shipped eight goals in total. The squad has been stretched beyond its limits and results are now suffering as such.",
      "Spurs have had an eight-day break since their last game - their longest gap between games this season. Thomas Frank is a process-focused, hands-on coach that needs training time to implement his ideas - something he's not had the luxury of this season. And although Frank's team have been one of the most impotent teams in the Premier League this season from an attacking perspective, there is quality in that forward line to feast on a Palace defensive process that is offering up more gifts than usual. The away win at 11/5 with Sky Bet is a touch generous.",

      "Away from home, Eddie Howe's side concede 1.21 shots from outside the box per game across their last 30 away league matches, the third-most of any Premier League team. That's a defensive concession profile that invites exactly the type of effort Cunha specialises in.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says it is \"impossible\" to replace Bruno Fernandes as the captain faces a spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.",
      "Amorim is hoping Fernandes' absence will give other players the chance to step up and lead the team, as well as take up his position in midfield.",
      "\"It's impossible to replace Bruno,\" the head coach said in his pre-match press conference. \"But I said that this morning to the team, we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "\"It's not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can't rely on one player for everything.",
      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad in set pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "\"This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw, all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "On who might come in for Fernandes in Man Utd's midfield, Amorim added: \"We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job [against Aston Villa] and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "\"I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust in my players. If we are really focused in the game, we can win.\"",
      "Amorim's comments on Fernandes come almost a week after the midfielder claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy the head coach.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "He said: \"I would love to go back to the last year. We suffer a lot in this moment and I would do things so differently.",
      "\"I learned more this year than the other five as a manager. I will do so many things in a different way, not just in everything but also on the pitch, the way we play the game.",
      "\"No matter what happens in the future, I learned so much and I'm a different manager.",
      "\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing, but to take all the value of the squad that I had last year, maybe it was not the right choices all the time. I watched the games from last season to understand different things.",
      "\"I'm a different manager today. I will do maybe 75 per cent of the things different, but the key things, the red lines would be the same. I think I'm a better manager now.\"",

      "By Callum Bishop, Adam Bate, Noah Langford, Sam Cohen",
      "Friday 26 December 2025 19:47, UK",
      "For the first time since he joined in 2020, Manchester United face the prospect of losing the talismanic Bruno Fernandes through injury for a sustained period of time.",
      "Fernandes was replaced at half-time during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa after suddenly pulling up late in the first-half. United boss Ruben Amorim clarified after the game that his captain had suffered soft tissue damage and that he would miss 'some games.'",
      "It's a bitter blow for the Red Devils ahead of a busy period that could define their season. Every statistic under the sun shows just how valuable the 31-year-old is at Old Trafford.",
      "Most, if not all Manchester United fans will be thinking that this is the opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo to prove his worth to Ruben Amorim.",
      "From scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final and representing England at that year's European Championships, the midfielder finds himself without a Premier League start this season.",
      "It has led to speculation that he could depart the Theatre of Dreams, on loan or permanently, as frustration over game time grows.",
      "Unexpectedly, the door has now opened. With Fernandes out, there is no chance Amorim lets Mainoo go in January. And having insisted that the club captain is who the academy graduate is competing with for a place in the team, it seems only logical that he will finally be handed his opportunity.",
      "That won't be against Newcastle though, as Amorim confirmed he will likely miss out with a calf injury that also saw him left out of the squad against Villa. He'll be hoping one of the other alternative options doesn't lay claim to the spot before he even has a chance to.Callum Bishop",
      "Mason Mount has started Manchester United's last three Premier League games. Into his third season as a United player, this is only the second time that he has been on such a run, previously starting four in a row at the back end of last season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's absence has opened up a slot for him tucked in off the right but Mount has had plenty of Premier League minutes in a deeper role and could prove a good foil alongside the far less mobile Casemiro. He would appear an able deputy for Fernandes.",
      "Of course, shifting him from the forward line, particularly with Mbeumo and Amad Diallo away, would only present Amorim with another challenge and it may be that Mount's pressing higher up the pitch is deemed a more important asset to the United coach.Adam Bate",
      "\"In the first half they were by far the better team and surprisingly, I thought with Martinez in midfield in the second half, they were the equal of [Aston] Villa as a minimum.\"",
      "Those were Gary Neville's words as Lisandro Martinez was brought on at the break to replace the injured Fernandes at Villa Park.",
      "Martinez is primarily a centre-back, but has shown he can step into midfield when required. The Argentine is not unfamiliar with that position. During his time at Ajax, he was at times utilised in the middle of the park.",
      "In his 22 games as a stereotypical number six, he averaged close to 66 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy above 86 per cent, ranked highly for final-third passes among others in those games, and still contributed defensively with solid numbers for tackles, interceptions and possessions won in the middle third.",
      "Martinez would not offer the same creativity as Fernandes, but his ability to recycle possession, read the game and maintain structure could provide a different type of balance in midfield. With fixtures coming thick and fast, his versatility gives Amorim another internal option to consider while United’s captain remains unavailable.Sam Cohen",
      "With Casemiro suspended against Aston Villa, it was left to Manuel Ugarte to try and slot in next to Fernandes, though he did little to rubber stamp his credentials.",
      "Ugarte once again failed to impress. He was lacklustre with and without the ball - he didn’t create any big chances or manage a single shot on target, whilst also losing the most aerial duels of any player in the game.",
      "Defeat on Sunday means that the Uruguayan has lost all seven of his last seven starts. To boot, an eighth loss in nine marks the longest run without a Premier League victory for a starting Man Utd player for over two decades. Only Kleberson, between January 2004 and May 2005, managed a longer winless run in a red shirt.",
      "Ugarte’s hefty £50.7m price tag has come into question frequently during his tenure in Manchester, especially given the recent success of his predecessor, Scott McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave United for £26m - only half of the outlay for Ugarte.",
      "Just this weekend, McTominay won the Italian Supercoppa, his second piece of silverware since moving to Italy, off the back of being named Serie A Player of the Year last month.",
      "He likely would’ve been an ideal solution. But the man who essentially took his place in the squad has done little to silence the doubters.Noah Langford",
      "There was something noticably different about the way United set up against Aston Villa. As opposed to leading with a pressing front three and double pivot behind, Amorim opted to defensively lead with a front two and a triangle three propping up behind, including Fernandes, Mount and Ugarte.",
      "Assuming Casemiro would return in place of the latter, this could be something Amorim turns to more often. Mount or Mainoo could slot into the Fernandes role, with the other remaining further up the pitch.",
      "Should Bryan Mbeumo return from AFCON before Fernandes is fit to return, perhaps he links up with Matheus Cunha up top while Benjamin Sesko takes up an impact substitute role as he continues his adaptation to the Premier League.",
      "This would still give Mount the chance to take up an important position in the team given his growing influence on the side of late.Callum Bishop",
      "We'd be remissed not to touch upon the fact that there could be a surprise inclusion for one of United's youngsters to step into the team with Fernandes out.",
      "Jack Fletcher, son of former Red Devil and current lead coach of the club's under-18s side Darren, made his senior debut off the bench at Villa Park and has been touted as a potential star of the future. His twin brother, Tyler, also plays as a midfielder and may see a chance for himself.",
      "Eighteen-year-old Jim Thwaites has also been earning praise for his development, while Sekou Kone has had experienced training with the first-team before. Although, recent fitness struggles may set back any hopes he has of a sniff.",
      "Amorim has not long spoken about the entitlement of some of his youngsters, but now he may have to rely on them more than previously.Callum Bishop",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "To be honest, being truthful, the first two, three days… I'm not really an emotional person to be honest, but they are the worst feelings I've ever had in my life.",
      "Then a week passes, two weeks pass, and you look at it like: I can never feel that bad again. I can never feel like I did that day when I found out.",
      "So everything from there is just like, say that's down there, well, even if you might be here, at least you're not down there. So then it gives you that reason to go, 'no, no, this can't get the better of me'.",
      "It just gives you more of a purpose and a focus that you can overcome it, because you've overcome this and you've come out the other end.",
      "You accept that some days you're going to think about it.",
      "I think to be honest, considering the circumstances, I'm doing okay. I'm cracking on.",

      "I'm lucky to have the family around me that I do. It's such a cliché thing to say, but I would not be where I am today without him and my family.",
      "It's impossible at six, seven, eight years old to drive yourself to training or make certain times and stuff like that. You have to rely on them to get you through that part.",
      "When you're young, all you want to do is get old. You get to 18 and all you want to do is drive and then you want to do this and that.",
      "I've said it before but you have such a different outlook on life when things like this have happened because there's nothing that can prepare you for it.",
      "But you become more grateful and you become more humble, and stuff that you might have looked down your nose at and thought that's just part of everyday life, it kind of rises up to your eye level and you think you've got to be grateful for what you have.",
      "It has given me a different perspective, but it's making a situation that is really tough and taking as many positives out of it as I can.",
      "Otherwise you can't live the rest of your life being negative and so upset about it.",
      "You have to try and be positive and you have to try and give yourself a purpose and a reason to get up every day. To work hard, achieve your dreams and goals that he would want you to do if he was still here.",
      "You've just got to crack on.",
      "I think for me, you look at it and you look at the effect that it has on other people, but then you also look at how much people appreciate that person who isn't there.",
      "That is the simple fact where people don't realise how appreciated they are and they don't realise what they do for others and this is the thing, we do take it for granted.",
      "Even if someone's having the best time of their life and everything's going well and they might have a business and it's doing really well, whatever it might be, it's still checking in on them because you don't want it to just become a point where it's like, only when things are going wrong, 'are you okay?'",
      "You could be having the best time ever, whatever situation it might be, just speaking about it is so powerful.",
      "You don't realise just having a conversation about how you feel and not having that stigma around it especially with men.",
      "I've been in a football environment since I was six years old, I've been here since I was eight years old and it's like you try and put on this brave face and you think that you can't talk about how you might be feeling but it's so important, it is so important that you talk about in any walk of life, any workplace, whatever it might be, talking about how you feel, there's never a problem with that.",
      "I know it will 100 per cent feel like such a big thing and it'd be so difficult to talk and you feel like it's also that feeling of being past help but you're never ever past help like if you reach out… there isn't an age limit on when you can speak up or go to therapy or, you know, make a situation better.",
      "There is no age limit, there is no time limit, there is nobody who could speak to me about how they were feeling and I'd shut it down or I'd disregard it.",
      "Like just speaking up and it could honestly be a two-minute conversation but you don't realise like how much that might help you.",
      "My dad wouldn't have known how much he was loved and cared for. I had messages from people... he was working at a tyre place changing tyres, people who've met him once saying 'oh, such a lovely man,' so on and so forth. You don't realise you have people that you meet once or people that you meet a million times...",
      "You know, just speaking about how you feel, you know, there's never, and definitely in my case, there would never be a time that I would shut that down.",
      "The club have been amazing since I've come back in.",
      "It's one of them, I was back in a week after because I think this is my passion and it's a positive distraction, it's what I enjoy doing but if I needed to take a month, two months, whatever it might be, there wouldn't have been a problem.",
      "I've been here for so long, it's like my family and at times you see people at football more than you see your family at home and you're so close to them.",
      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",
