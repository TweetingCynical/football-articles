      "Ruben Amorim has blasted Harry Amass and Chido Obi for sharing photos on Instagram following his remarks about the academy last week, branding them \"entitled\" and claiming it epitomises the atmosphere within the Manchester United squad.",
      "Amorim highlighted concerns about the two players last week, stating that Amass was currently \"struggling\" at the foot of the Championship and that Chido wasn't featuring regularly for the club's Under-21 team.",
      "These observations didn't sit well with the players, who both uploaded images of their achievements to their Instagram profiles on Monday when the quotes emerged. Amass shared a photograph of himself holding a player of the month trophy at Sheffield Wednesday, whilst Chido's post showed him celebrating a goal for the Under-21s.",
      "Amorim maintained his remarks weren't meant negatively and argued that the reaction from the pair of 18 year olds exemplified the sense of privilege he believes persists at the club. \"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",
      "\"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping. That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement.",
      "\"I have that feeling all the time that we need to fight against this feeling. Sometimes I'm the first one to say that I'm failing this club inside the pitch, I have that feeling we are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch, I guarantee you I'm not failing to this club.",
      "\"I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled.",
      "\"They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me. And that is the way we can solve things. I think we need to change first as a club and then everything is going to change.\"",
      "Amorim emphasised that his office door remained open should either of the young players wish to discuss concerns about his remarks during his press conference before the Bournemouth match.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong. I just spoke about how the luck of playing for Manchester United,\" he explained. \"Sometimes you play for Manchester United and you go see different realities and you understand that football can be so different and that you are really lucky to be in Manchester United.",
      "\"That was my point but, again, let's move on and with the time that I think these things will change.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has been impressed by three of Manchester United’s summer signings and has backed them to inspire better form at Old Trafford. United shelled out over £200million on new players in the summer and the new additions have begun to gel in recent weeks under Ruben Amorim’s management.",
      "United brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens before the start of the 2025/26 season, while January signing Diego Leon also arrived following their 15th-place finish. Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp and was installed as the No.1 goalkeeper, with Andre Onana shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "Some pundits were worried that Lammens may struggle with the jump up in quality, having only played in Belgium’s top flight, but he has settled well between the posts. Ferguson, who managed United between 1987 and 2013, is still a regular at Old Trafford to watch Amorim’s side and is a fan of Lammens.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper has made a difference,” Ferguson told Press Box PR. “He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",
      "\"The other two, Mbeumo and Cunha, they look as if they will contribute to the recovery of our form.” United are sixth in the Premier League following their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday at Old Trafford.",
      "That high-scoring draw means United are now joint second-top scorers in the Premier League, level with leaders Arsenal on 30 goals, with Manchester City (38) the only club to have scored more. But their 26 goals conceded shows that issues remain in defence, with that the highest of any side in the top 12 of the table.",
      "Ferguson won 13 league titles for United and is confident that the club have the right person in place with Amorim, even if it will take a long time to get them back to the top. “He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy,” he said.",
      "“I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has shared a spirited message on social media following his goal in Napoli's Supercoppa semi-final triumph over AC Milan - a fixture which also saw his former Manchester United teammate Scott McTominay held back after a fiery confrontation. The 2-0 victory against their Serie A rivals secured Antonio Conte's squad a spot in the final - where they'll face either Bologna or Inter Milan, who clash on Friday night.",
      "The four-club competition, taking place in Saudi Arabia this year, includes the champions and runners-up from last season's Serie A and Coppa Italia. There won't be back-to-back winners, as defending champions AC Milan have now been knocked out of the competition.",
      "Hojlund - who is loan at Napoli from United - netted in the 63rd minute to provide his side with a comfortable cushion heading into the final stages. Alongside the significance of his strike, the Danish forward's post-match social media behaviour also caught some attention.",
      "He shared a photograph of himself sprawled on the turf after tumbling in the wake of his goal. The image came with the words: \"No context Rasmus.\"",
      "Supporters seemed largely unbothered by the mysterious caption, instead flooding the replies with compliments for the forward - who appears to be regaining his confidence since leaving United this summer. Another former United player flourishing since departing Old Trafford is McTominay.",
      "He was also involved against AC Milan, although his night featured a contrasting type of incident. With 81 minutes on the clock, AC Milan were granted a free-kick after a tackle from the Scotland international.",
      "The ball subsequently found its way to ex-Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori, who seemed to kick it back towards McTominay. The situation quickly escalated between the two teams.",
      "If not for the neutral location of Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh, things could have become even more heated. McTominay took umbrage at Tomori's actions and confronted the defender, going head-to-head until Napoli striker Lorenzo Lucca stepped in to restrain him.",
      "Both players received yellow cards, and Napoli managed to hold their ground for the rest of the match, securing their spot in the Supercoppa final set for Monday night. Meanwhile, back in Serie A, the title race is still too close to call as we head into 2026.",
      "Only three points separate the top four, with Napoli currently in third place, trailing leaders Inter Milan by two points. Hojlund and McTominay might soon be joined by another former United teammate - as Kobbie Mainoo is rumoured to be on his way to Naples in the January transfer window.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim's team are reportedly demanding an 'exceptional offer' before they would even consider selling the academy graduate.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has suggested it could be another decade before Manchester United win the Premier League again. But the legendary former Red Devils boss has thrown his weight behind Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have struggled since the legendary Scotsman retired in 2013, with their last Premier League title coming under him in 2012/13. The Old Trafford club have had six permanent managers since Ferguson - winning five major trophies in that time.",
      "None of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Erik ten Hag were able to deliver the success that Ferguson achieved on a regular basis. United finished 15th last term, their lowest finish in the Premier League era, and missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Ferguson, who won 38 major trophies with the Red Devils, reckons it could be a while until his former club become champions of England again. But he praised Amorim, saying: \"He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy.",
      "\"I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",

      "He added: \"I think my appetite was for young people and players. When I went to St Mirren, they had no money. The best thing I could do was sit at the coaching schools on Tuesdays and Thursdays with the young players, and then five ended up becoming internationals.",
      "\"Then I went to Aberdeen and continued that ethic; we won the European Cup without our own training ground and eight players were produced by the club. It was fantastic.",
      "\"When I went to United, Bobby Charlton was in the meeting and I said: 'I don’t know why you have appointed me unless you give me the reign to produce young players.' Bobby said, 'That’s done, you’ve got the job.' Bobby Charlton was a fantastic man.\"",

      "Few would look at Ruben Amorim's situation at Manchester United and think: 'This is a calm situation'. However, Bryan Mbeumo may find himself doing just that after linking up with his Cameroon colleagues.",
      "Just as the summer signing found his feet at Old Trafford, he is departing the red side of Manchester to compete in Morocco for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). But the situation at the Indomitable Lions has grown chaotic as he has been called up to the national team by two different managers.",
      "His former United colleague and international captain Andre Onana has also been called up for one Cameroon team and not the other. Marc Brys, the former manager of the country who was sacked by Cameroonian FA president Samuel Eto'o, is insisting he is still in post, despite David Pagou being appointed at the start of the month.",
      "Ahead of the start of the competition, which begins on December 21, two different Cameroon AFCON squad lists have emerged. Fortunately for Mbeumo, as one of his country's star players, he has appeared on both.",
      "The same cannot be said of Onana, who left United and was sent on loan to Trabzonspor after a poor start to this campaign. Brys was sacked by the Cameroon FA shortly after Eto'o, the iconic former Barcelona and Inter Milan ace, was re-elected as Cameroonian FA president after receiving 97% of the votes.",
      "He and Brys had a fractious relationship, which stemmed from the Cameroonian sports ministry taking the decision to appoint him as manager instead of Eto'o. When Eto'o was re-elected, he took his majority as a mandate to dismiss the Belgian.",
      "According to ESPN, a fierce meeting between Eto'o and his committee ended with them alleging Brys had committed \"11 infractions\" ranging from \"disrespectful\" and \"biased\" remarks, \"professional misconduct\" and \"manipulation\" of players, where they specifically accuse him of trying to turn them against the country's FA.",
      "Despite this, Brys insists he has not received any formal communication from the Cameroonian FA regarding his dismissal, even though Pagou is in situ. He has been working, business as usual, except this situation could not be more unusual.",
      "He submitted his own squad list for the competition, featuring Onana as well as other experienced Cameroon stars Vincent Aboubakar, Eric Choupo-Moting and Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui. On the same day, Pagou issued his own squad for the tournament, without the aforementioned quartet.",
      "Last week, confusion reined as to whether the excluded Onana, Aboubakar, Choupo-Moting and Ngadeu-Ngadjui would actually be involved in north Africa. A Cameroonian official has made it clear in the same source any player who is on Brys' list, but not on Pagou's, will not be involved.",
      "The former Cameroon manager, despite asserting that he is still the current boss, has been left furious by this situation. He specifically lashed out at Eto'o, claiming the experienced quartet have been excluded because they challenged the ex-Chelsea forward's authority.",
      "He told Afrik Foot: \"Eto'o has left out important players, and leaders, because he's obviously the one who made this list. How can you go to such a tournament without a world-class goalkeeper, or without Aboubakar? Because these are players with character, who stand up to the president.\"",

      "Manchester United have been tipped to revive their interest in Ruben Neves in January. The Red Devils were linked with the Portugal international before he left Wolves for Al Hilal in 2023, and those connections have now resurfaced.",
      "Neves, 28, captained Wolves to promotion to the Premier League in 2018 and played more than 250 times for the Molineux club in six years. He became one of the Saudi Pro League's big statement signings, though, following compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo in moving to the Gulf.",
      "Al Hilal paid a reported £47million for the midfielder, who is believed to be one of the higher earners in Saudi football. His contract is expiring this summer, though, potentially paving the way for a cut-price January exit.",
      "According to The Mail, Al Hilal are prepared to accept around £20m for Neves, who is said to have no plans to extend his contract. That could make him a more realistic prospect than some of the other midfield targets on United's radar.",
      "Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are both high on the Red Devils' list, but neither is unlikely to be available for less than £100m in January. If Ruben Amorim decides new blood is required in the middle of the park, Neves could tick a lot of boxes.",
      "Neves helped Al Hilal win the Saudi Pro League title in his first season, with the Riyadh club going the whole season unbeaten. They only finished second last term, though, replacing manager Jorge Jesus with former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi at the end of the campaign.",
      "They are unbeaten after nine games of Inzaghi's first season at the helm, though they're four points adrift of league leaders Al Nassr. Neves has scored four goals - two of those in his last two games - as well as one in a King's Cup quarter-final victory over Al Fateh.",
      "United's links with Neves come at a time when Bruno Fernandes has once again been linked with a move in the opposite direction. Al Hilal failed with a summer move for the Old Trafford captain, who opened the door to a future move in a November interview which has come to light this month.",
      "\"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge,\" former Sporting CP star Fernandes told Canal 11 (via Maisfutebol and translated by Sport Witness).. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia,”",
      "“My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.\"",
      "He said he decided to stay after conversations with manager Amorim but was \"hurt\" by the club's position on a potential exit. \"“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club,\" he added.",
      "\"The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.\"",

Unai Emery’s side have lost just two of their last 12 matches in league and cup, and six of their last seven games have featured both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals. The hosts have netted at least twice in seven of their last eight outings, but have only managed one clean sheet in their previous seven matches.",
      "However, Villa’s recent record against Manchester United is less impressive, with just two wins from the last 10 meetings between the sides in all competitions. United have lost only once in their last four visits to Villa Park, earning two draws and a win in that span. Five of the last eight encounters between these teams have seen both sides score and over 2.5 goals.",

Seven of United’s last 10 league matches have produced both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals, and they’ve scored at least twice in eight of those fixtures. With both teams in strong attacking form, another high-scoring encounter is expected at Villa Park this weekend.",
      "Unai Emery faces a headache with Emi Martinez (back) and Pau Torres (calf) facing late fitness tests ahead of the match at Villa Park. Jadon Sancho is not available as he is not allowed to face his parent club as per loan rules while Tyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) continue to serve long layoffs.",

      "In fact, United icon Roy Keane has described his disdain following a recent development in the Kobbie Mainoo storyline. That's after the midfielder's half-sibling was spotted wearing a divisive piece of clothing during the latest Premier League fixture.",
      "Amid the furore concerning Mainoo's playing time (or lack thereof), the midfielder has remained largely silent on the matter.

Word of the incident eventually got back to club legend Keane, who addressed it on the Stick to Football podcast.",

Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'He has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane was open to the prospect of Mainoo going out on loan but challenged the prospect to prove Amorim wrong at Old Trafford instead. Amorim, meanwhile, has said he's be open to sitting down for a discussion with the player if approached.",
      "Many a United fan, and likely Amorim himself, is wondering just how the club will fare during the absence of their AFCON stars. And there's little doubt Mbeumo will be the biggest presence missing from their right flank.",
      "However, it's perhaps Mbeumo himself who should feel concern after a supercomputer tipped his Cameroon side for an early departure. The model, which was devised by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, forecast the Indomitable Lions will fail to get out of Group F after facing the Ivory Coast, Gabon and Mozambique.",
      "Mbeumo's absence would therefore be relatively short, and he may even be back for the fixture against Leeds on January 4 as a result. Former United defender Paul Parker recently put into words the effect Mbeumo's absence will have on the team, with no other player at Amorim's disposal able to fulfil the same duties.",
      "\"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON,\" said two-time Premier League champion Parker. \"They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.\"",

      "Manchester United plan to go 'all-out' to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth next month, hoping that uncertainty over Pep Guardiola's position could aid their quest. The Red Devils face some lofty competition for the Cherries star, who has a release clause of £65million that activates in January.",
      "Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool are all interested in agreeing a deal for the Ghana international. Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in London at the end of last season, but United were put off by Bournemouth’s £80m plus asking price.",
      "The Portuguese coach called Semenyo a 'special player' before United's match with Bournemouth on Monday. The charm offensive may prove more convincing if City cannot provide assurances over Guardiola, and United will look to take advantage, according to the Telegraph.",
      "There is a ‘growing anticipation’ that it could be Guardiola’s final campaign as City boss. The Catalan coach only penned a new deal until 2027 last year bit it is claimed City's hierarchy have made contingency plans.",
      "Speaking out on his future earlier this season, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss said: \"I've said many times I don't know what will happen [in the future]. Results dictate the positions and I have to make a good season.",
      "\"I will not stay when I feel that the club needs a change. But right now, I feel I want to do it, more than ever after what happened last season.",
      "\"I am not saying that just because of what I have done in the past. I like to look forward.",
      "\"But the time I am going to stay? When I first joined and signed for three years I would never expected to have stayed for a decade. I am so proud of that. I want to help the team, the club again and again.\"",
      "United are said to be confident about their chances of landing Semenyo. The club's board and Amorim are thought to be fans of Semenyo's tactical versatility.",
      "Amorim envisages him in an attacking wing-back role, with Amad on the opposite flank. Semenyo is believed to be open to such a move as he contemplates his future.",

      "Mainoo, 20, was stopped from moving to Napoli during the summer window, and the Italian giants are one of a number of clubs interested in his services. Despite United's reluctance to part ways with the academy product, the midfielder has yet to start a Premier League match this season.",
      "That means Mainoo is likely to end the window frustrated. The midfielder's brother was in attendance at Old Trafford on Monday and wore a shirt that said: \"FREE KOBBIE MAINOO\".",
      "The youngster has been unable to earn much playing time with Ruben Amorim preferring Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in the centre of midfield. After shining for England at Euro 2024, Mainoo's chances of making Thomas Tuchel's World Cup group look slim.",
      "United's Portuguese head coach says Mainoo is in direct competition with key player and captain Fernandes, meaning it's natural minutes will be limited. \"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "Asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",

Under different managers, he developed a knack for scoring goals, but the versatile midfielder was deployed in various positions and never became a guaranteed starter.",

      "Since his departure, he has secured a league title, been crowned Serie A MVP, and helped Scotland qualify for the 2026 World Cup. A Supercoppa Italiana semi-final against AC Milan is now on the horizon, and former Manchester City defender Lescott believes he was never properly trusted by coaches at Old Trafford.",

      "\"It was just that he wasn't allowed to do it every week and I also don't think he was allowed to have a bad game. I think there were times where he would score, do well, stay in the team and then if he didn't do it again, he was coming out.",
      "\"I don't think every player has that set balance or is not given the grace of playing badly. I think that comes when you're a homegrown talent, though.",
      "\"Because for Scotland he's always done it. He did it in spells for Man United, but I don't think he was given the kind of belief from the coaches to go and say, 'You don't have to be Man of the Match every week but you can stay in the team.'\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool skipper Graeme Souness also believes that McTominay may have been let go too soon, arguing that if he had stayed, he would currently be United's top midfielder.",
      "\"They've spent a lot of money on [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro. I got much criticised for saying I thought he was an ordinary Joe when they signed him. I still see him as an ordinary Joe, a very steady player,\" Souness told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"They sold the best one: Scott McTominay. He was better than those two and he's just grown in his job since he's been at Napoli. I understand why you would use Bruno as a six, but then you want to use him as a 10 as well.",

      "Ian Wright has claimed that Arsenal would sign Bruno Fernandes ‘tomorrow’ after calling out Manchester United chiefs. The Portuguese playmaker has put his future at Old Trafford in major doubt by claiming that the Red Devils wanted him to leave in the summer.",
      "United have however insisted that Fernandes remained key to their plans and they did not want to sell him. The Portuguese midfielder has now fired an ultimatum at his bosses, saying that he will only stay with the club so long as he is wanted.",
      "As the row continues, Arsenal icon Ian Wright has shared his thoughts and claimed the Gunners would snap Fernandes up should he leave United.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Wright said: “When you look at Bruno’s quotes, it comes back to Man United being indecisive. So someone comes in for Bruno Fernandes last summer… you shut that down.",
      "“He didn’t want to go. Bruno is basically saying the club went, ‘it’s up to you if you want to leave’. That’s not what you want to hear when you’re the person who has basically held the club up by yourself.",
      "“You want the club to say, ‘you’re not going nowhere, you’re a massive part of this’. But Manchester United didn’t do that.",
      "“They gave him the option and said, 'if you want to go, you can go'. What is that saying to him? I would take him tomorrow.”",
      "Wright’s comments come after Fernandes broke rank to share his stance on an exit from Old Trafford. Speaking while on international duty earlier this year, he said: “I could have left like many people do and said: ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’ But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",

      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",

      "Bruno Fernandes has said that his time at Manchester United hasn't run as planned, and that he had opportunities elsewhere when the club struggled the most. The Portuguese midfielder joined the Red Devils in a £47million deal with Sporting CP in January 2020.",
      "And while the 31-year-old will have held aspirations of reliving the trophy-laden glory that the club held under Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary tenure, things haven't quite played out that way under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and now Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has just an FA Cup and a League Cup to show for his efforts in the heart of United's engine room, while the club's Premier League performances have also faded since his arrival. Last season saw United register their poorest-ever Premier League finish since the league's inception of 1992, as Amorim's debut saw the Red Devils finish in a lacklustre 15th.",
      "The club also missed out on winning the Europa League title in May, courtesy of a bitter 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. And now, appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has reflected on his time at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about his love of the club by Ferdinand, the United captain said: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes spoke to Ferdinand earlier this month, ahead of a damning recent interview emerging which saw him claim that the United board wanted him away from the club in the summer. Saudi giants Al-Hilal were ready to offer United £100m to sign Fernandes, but the attacking midfielder instead opted to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "The club were also reportedly willing to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have seen him rake in around £100m over the course of a three-year contract. And now, the playmaker has suggested that while Amorim wanted him to stay, the United hierarchy were keen to cash in.",
      "He told Canal 11: \"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’",

      "The England international requested a loan move towards the end of the transfer window, but the club refused to let him go. Mainoo has featured in just 11 Premier League matches under Amorim this season, every single one as a substitute.",
      "His sole start this campaign came in the EFL Cup loss to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, caused a stir by sporting a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the dramatic 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Mainoo entered the fray with less than half an hour remaining, marking his third-longest appearance in the league this term, in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford. Mainoo-Hames shared the photo on his Instagram account, prompting fresh questions about the midfielder's future and mindset.",
      "\"He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",

      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\".",
      "Despite all the speculation surrounding Mainoo, Amorim has declined to confirm whether a loan move would be approved. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

      "The final 2025/26 Premier League standings have been simulated - in what is good news for Arsenal fans. Heading into Christmas it is still all to play for after 16 games, but at this early stage the Gunners have staked their claim for the title.",
      "Following closely behind are challengers Manchester City and Aston Villa, who at worst will be hopeful of securing Champions League qualification via the top-four. Also in the running for European football look to be Chelsea, Manchester United, reigning champions Liverpool - who have been off the pace, and Sunderland.",
      "At the opposite end of the table, Wolves and West Ham have endured tough starts to the new campaign, and could become the first existing Premier League clubs in three seasons to drop down. Also in the scrap are Burnley, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest.",
      "So, how will the final Premier League standings turn out? The answer will not be certain until next May, but Opta's latest results give a hint as to how matters may play out...",
      "A genuine \"nightmare\" season. They are currently winless (0–2–14) and rooted to the bottom. New manager Rob Edwards faces a monumental task to overturn a -26 goal difference.",
      "Like many newly-promoted sides in recent seasons, Scott Parker’s side have found the jump in quality difficult, managing only three wins so far as they struggle to keep clean sheets.",
      "A disastrous season so far. Graham Potter was sacked in September, and Nuno Espirito Santo is currently struggling to pull the Hammers out of the relegation zone.",
      "Another newly-promoted side who is fighting hard, using an imposing physical style to stay just outside the bottom three, or so the prediction says will happen...",
      "A chaotic start saw Nuno Espirito Santo sacked, his successor Ange Postecoglou also got the boot after just weeks in charge, and now Sean Dyche has been brought in to do what he does best: grind out the results needed to stay up.",
      "Under Marco Silva, Fulham have continued to be the \"entertainers\" of the mid-table. They have been involved in some of the season's most chaotic matches, including a 4–5 loss to Manchester City earlier this month.",
      "It has been a season of significant transition for the Bees. After seven years, legendary manager Thomas Frank departed for Tottenham in June and was replaced by former assistant Keith Andrews, but the club has kept on fighting despite pre-season chatter of relegation.",
      "Despite selling key defenders Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, Andoni Iraola has kept the Cherries competitive with a high-pressing system that recently claimed a major scalp against Spurs.",
      "The surprise package of the season. Returning to the top flight after eight years, the Black Cats have been remarkably resilient, specializing in late drama with a league-high five goals scored in stoppage time.",
      "It’s been a bumpy road for Thomas Frank in his first season at Spurs. After replacing Ange Postecoglou, Frank has struggled to balance Europa League demands with domestic form, leaving Spurs in an uncharacteristic 11th place.",
      "Under the guidance of David Moyes, the Toffees have moved away from relegation scraps and into a comfortable top-half position, though they struggle for consistency against the elite.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side remains tactically brave and entertaining, though they've dropped points in games they dominated.",
      "Limited summer spending has led to a sense of 'staleness'. They remain tough to beat at St. James' Park but have regressed significantly from the form that helped achieve Champions League qualification last season.",
      "Now under Ruben Amorim, United are showing signs of life after a \"historically bad\" 2024/25. While their defense is still leaky (26 conceded), their attack is much more fluid with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount finding rhythm.",
      "Following their FA Cup win last season, Palace have maintained incredible momentum. Despite a tough schedule, Oliver Glasner has them playing high-intensity football that has them sitting above several giants.",
      "Under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea have finally stabilized. They’ve adopted a possession-heavy style and found a spark in Joao Pedro. But, it might be just too little to reach the Champions League next season...",
      "It has been a difficult second season for Arne Slot. After a brilliant title-winning campaign last year, the defending champions have struggled with mega-money signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz bedding in, plus injuries. A recent dip that saw them lose five out of six games in late autumn.",
      "Unai Emery has transformed Villa from \"best of the rest\" into genuine title threats. After failing to win in their first five matches, they've turned things around and sit just three points off the top, proving their staying power.",
      "Despite a rocky start that saw Pep Guardiola endure his worst-ever opening month, City have surged back. Erling Haaland remains inevitable with 17 Premier League goals already, though the team has looked more defensively vulnerable than in previous years (e.g., that wild 5–4 win over Fulham).",
      "The current leaders have been the model of consistency. Mikel Arteta’s side boasts the league's best defence (only 10 goals conceded) and an 11-game unbeaten run earlier this term. With new signings Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke helping to add the clinical edge they lacked last season, they look like the team to beat."

      "Manchester United are bracing for the absence of three key players in the coming weeks as Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui all head off to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament, staged by Morocco, begins on Sunday with the hosts facing Comoros.",
      "The final is scheduled to take place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18 and United supporters will be keen to know when their trio could return. According to a new Afcon Supercomputer prediction, Morocco are favourites to secure their first Afcon title since 1976.",
      "The prediction, made by Afcon betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, suggests that the host nation will edge out Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. If this comes to pass, United full-back Mazraoui won't be available for manager Ruben Amorim until the away match against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "In contrast, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to make an early exit at the group stages, which could see him return for United's away game at Leeds on January 4. While such an outcome would not go down well with Cameroon and Mbeumo, it certainly would for United, who would have one of their leading players back available before long.",
      "The supercomputer also forecasts that Senegal will eliminate Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a convincing 3-0 win. However, he would still miss the Manchester derby on January 17 as it coincides with the third-place playoff - a match the Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction suggests that Amad is likely to rejoin the squad around the same time as Mazraoui, potentially in time for the late January clash with Arsenal. In what could prove to be the tournament's most shocking result, Egypt and their talisman Mohamed Salah are tipped to suffer a 1-0 defeat to Comoros in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both having secured their spots at next year's World Cup, are anticipated to progress to the quarter-finals, whilst Tunisia, another World Cup qualifier, are forecast to bow out before the knockout phases. Amorim faces the challenge of finding answers with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui sidelined for the coming period, and former United defender Paul Parker reckons it will prove an enormously tough assignment.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo’s celebrity brother took a swipe at Ruben Amorim by wearing a provocative T-shirt at Manchester United’s Premier League clash against Bournemouth – and it’s not the first time the midfielder’s famous sibling has caused a stir at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo has fallen out of favour with boss Amorim as rumours swirl of a potential January exit. The England international has been left out of the starting line-up for all of United’s 16 league matches so far this season, with his only start coming in the Red Devils’ embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "The future had looked bright for the 20-year-old after a breakthrough 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, where he scored the winning goal in the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester City and became a key cog in the England side that reached the Euros final.",
      "But things have turned sour for the Stockport-born academy graduate since Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with United legend Paul Scholes among those urging Mainoo to leave his boyhood club in search of game time. According to reports, Mainoo was keen to join Napoli in the summer but had a transfer request turned down.",
      "The youngster received a rapturous reception from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he replaced Casemiro just past the hour mark during United’s absorbing 4-4 thriller with Bournemouth, but attention post-match quickly turned to an inflammatory statement made by his brother pitchside.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was pictured front row wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" in a move that risks aggravating a delicate situation already fraught with tension. The stunt has split United’s fanbase, with some supporters accusing Mainoo’s relative of unnecessary provocation, but others viewing the statement as a justified protest.",
      "Mainoo’s older sibling may well be familiar to many – the fashion model and influencer appeared on the 2019 series of hit reality TV show Love Island and has since amassed over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "He will also be a name known to those inside Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo revealed that his brother’s stint in the Love Island villa had earned him an unflattering nickname.",
      "He said: “My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me ‘Love Island’. He’s been doing so since I was like 16.”",

      "One way to make room in both the squad and the budget for further arrivals is to offload players. A handful of names have been linked with potential exits in recent times, none more so than midfielder Mainoo.",
      "The England international had been tipped to depart in the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli rumoured to be among the suitors. However, a move never came to fruition and the academy graduate was made to stay put.",
      "Unfortunately for Mainoo, his game time under Ruben Amorim has not improved this season. The 20-year-old has featured 12 times across all competitions this term, but has not started a single Premier League fixture.",
      "Amorim raised some eyebrows over the past week with his comments about United's young, up-and-coming players and his reluctance to use them. Mainoo was not the only name discussed, with 18-year-old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also singled out.",

      "The article notes that Mainoo is prioritising a move that would see him become a regular starter elsewhere. While Chelsea and Bayern Munich are said to be leading the chase, their already stacked midfield options mean Napoli reportedly remains the player's preferred destination at this stage.",
      "Like Mainoo, Amass also has a dozen clubs interested in signing him next month. He is currently on loan at Wednesday and is already featuring regularly, with 16 starts to his name.",

Amass posted a picture of him with a player of the month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the Under-21s.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments weren't negative and said the response of the pair of 18-year-olds summed up the sense of entitlement that he feels continues to linger around the club. \"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.",

The image went viral after Jordan posed for pictures at Old Trafford wearing the t-shirt during the 4-4 draw.",

      "Amorim said in the summer that he wanted the leadership group to take on more control to police dressing room matters, but he feels that hasn't yet happened and that problems within the club are still landing on his desk.",
      "He also made the point on several occasions that nobody had knocked on his office door this week, after challenging Mainoo to do just that last week, while he also hit out at Amass and Chido for posting their frustration on social media.",
      "\"It continues a bit everything on my desk, every problem it is still me, but again my door is still open,\" he said. \"It was not Kobbie. The job of Kobbie is to train and play and I thought he did really well. If he has to play he is going to play, he is not going to play.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has insisted Manchester United will be ready to win the Premier League title in the \"next few years\" and disagreed with Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that it could be a decade away. Ferguson compared United's current slump to the 31-year title drought Liverpool suffered and said it could be another cycle or two before his former club are ready to win the league.",
      "The 83-year-old won 13 Premier League titles in his time at Old Trafford but feels it could be a while before they are at the top of the tree again domestically, offering qualified backing to Amorim in the process.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is a good personality,\" he said. \"It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees. They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "\"We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle. It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\"",
      "But Amorim is confident that the wait won't be that long and that the club can put itself in a position to compete sooner rather than later.",
      "\"He understands football more than me, especially English football,\" he said. \"I think we are not going to take that long to win a league. I don't know which manager is going to be here, but I truly believe that we can fight for the title in the next years, and I think it's not going to take so many years, but you never know.\"",
      "Amorim also offered a response to Bruno Fernandes' comments on his own future earlier this week, when he suggested he felt United wanted him out in the summer but lacked the courage to sell him.",
      "\"The difference is that he spoke with the club before that interview and he said what he's feeling,\" said Amorim. \"Of course we can avoid these things because we already know the noise, but he talked with the board and I think everything is clear.",
      "\"I don't know if it's fair. He just spoke about what is his feelings and he needs to answer to that. It's not me. I think he is an example that he gives everything. He puts everything on the line in every training, in every match. In that department he's special.",
      "\"I think he has that feeling. We need to step up and to have also that feeling. So we need to ask him, because I think he's a big example in the group.",
      "\"He spoke his feelings. And I think, again, I think when I watch Bruno training and playing, he's a special character. And I think the numbers, the amount of games, everything proves that he's a different player.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim addressed the situations surrounding Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes during his press conference.",
      "After his brother wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt, questions were asked as to whether the midfielder knew what was going to happen. Amorim rejected these concerns and suggested he would not punish the midfielder for something his family member did.",
      "Amorim added he was aware of what Fernandes had said before the interview describing him feeling hurt were published. The United boss feels the situation is now clear between the captain and the club.",
      "As for team news, United have not lost any other players to injury ahead of the trip to Aston Villa. Both Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain unavailable and will not be travelling to the West Midlands.",
      "United's head coach also provided more context on his recent comments about the academy.",
      "Take a look back at what Amorim said below...",
      "Amorim laid into the Manchester United legends telling Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club and urged the midfielder to stay and fight for his place, insisting there is no issue after his half-brother wore a controversial t-shirt to the game against Bournemouth on Monday. Mainoo's brother Jordan wore a t-shirt saying 'Free Kobbie Mainoo', but Amorim said he hadn't felt the need to talk to the academy graduate about the incident and said he wouldn't be punishing him for the actions of a family member.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has slammed Harry Amass and Chido Obi for posting pictures on Instagram in response to his comments about the academy last week, labelling them \"entitled\" and saying it sums up the mood around the Manchester United squad. Amorim raised the issue of the two players last week, saying Amass was now \"struggling\" at the bottom of the Championship and that Chido wasn't starting every week for the club's Under-21 side.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That's all from part one of Amorim's press conference. The second part will be available from 10.30pm this evening.",
      "He understands football more, especially English football, I don’t think we’ll take that long to win the league [ten years]. I don’t know which manager will be here, but I truly believe we can fight for the title in the next years. It is not going to take so many years but you never know.",
      "In leadership, it’s the moment of the club, you have to fight all the fights. We are improving as a team, as a group, we going to improve in these small things. That will make a difference even to suffer goals, if we are a different group we will suffer less goals but we are scoring more so let's think about the positives and think about the Villa game.",
      "I think the feeling a little bit of entitled one we have in our club, sometimes strong words is not bad words, difficult moments are not bad for the kids. We don’t need always to be accolades for every situation. You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends so if you don’t play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, stay and fight, let's overcome maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling. I’m the first one to say I’m failing. Outside the pitch I guarantee I’m not failing this club. It is is something in our club and the players sometimes they forget the players what it means to play for Man United, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. It’s the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to talk to me. That is the way we solve things. We need to change as a club.",
      "I didn’t say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man United. Sometimes you play for Man United and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man United. That was my point but let's move on.",
      "It continues a little bit of everything on my desk, every problem at the football club is still me that has to deal with it. It will take time. Kobbie’s job is to train and play, I felt he did really well in this game. If he has to play he is going to play.",
      "I don’t know if it’s fair, he spoke about his feelings. He needs to answer to that, not me. He is an example, he gives everything and puts everything on the line in every training and every match, in that he is special, we need to step up to have that feeling. We need to ask him, I think he’s a big example in the group.",
      "He spoke his feelings. I think when I watch Bruno training and playing he is a special character, the numbers and amount of games prove he is a different player.",
      "The difference is he spoke with the club before the interview and said what he was feeling. We can avoid these things because we already know the noise. He talked with the board and I think everything is clear.",
      "No [conversations with Kobbie]. He played really well, that is the important thing, my office is always open, nobody went there this week so everything is normal and we are ready to go to Villa.",
      "We watch the game again against Bournemouth we can avoid those goals. There was a lot of transition and we have to put everything on the line when we’re defending and sometimes we’re not doing that.",
      "Everything can happen. They have a manager with a lot of experience, when you watch Villa you can sense it’s a very mature team, they don’t panic when they’re losing, don’t feel overwhelmed when winning, they can control the emotion all the time. They are a very strong team. If they fight to the end I don’t know.",
      "[He laughs] No, was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt, he’s not going to start because of the t-shirt and he’s not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He will play if we feel he’s the right guys. I’m used to it, I’ve been here for a year. I’m not going to do something to Kobbie because someone on his family did something. If he is the right guy he is going to play.",
      "No. Nobody recovers and nobody else is out just the guys you already know.",
      "I think everyone is well, we have one more training but today the rest of the guys are ready to go.",
      "We will be bringing you the quotes shortly...",
      "We are not long off Amorim's press conference. It should be a big one considering everything which has happened this week.",
      "It won't be long now until we hear what Amorim has to say before the trip to Villa. There is plenty on the agenda this afternoon and here are just some of the topics which could be touched upon...",
      "Speaking this week, United's legendary manager has admitted it could be a long time before the Reds manage to be competitive for the Premier League title again. However, Ferguson also gave his backing to Amorim after a mixed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "With everything that has happened this week, it is easy to see the game at Villa as a bit of an afterthought. However, taking their eye off Unai Emery's side would be to their detriment. They have won their last nine games in a row in all competitions and last lost at the start of November to Liverpool. Villa are third in the Premier League and it will be a difficult test for the Reds. Sancho is ineligible to face his parent club.",
      "In his latest interview, this time with Rio Ferdinand, Fernandes admitted he could have won more if he had not shown the loyalty he has to United.",
      "I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim's press conference could be very interesting considering everything which has happened this week. His response to questions surrounding Fernandes will be particularly telling. Amorim has been a big fan of Fernandes and has refused to drop him this season. It seems clear the United boss would not want his captain to leave.",
      "Scott McTominay was asked this week about the improvement some players show when they leave United.",
      "The former Reds midfielder has been brilliant since his move to Napoli and he's not the only player to have flourished since his Old Trafford departure.",
      "However, he refused to say United were the problem when asked about the progress some players make when they leave the club, calling the theory \"a myth\".",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "We'll have every word from the United boss at 1.30pm today.",
      "Fernandes and Mainoo are both expected to be on the agenda after the former's bombshell interview and the latter's brother wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Monday's game.",
      "Team news and injury updates will also be given.",
      "Stick with us for updates and reaction.",
      "Two Bruno Fernandes interviews have been released this week and they've sparked plenty of debate.",
      "The United captain told Canal 11 that he felt the club were open to him leaving in the summer, yet then told a podcast that United asked him to stay.",
      "Amorim is sure to be asked about Fernandes' future this afternoon.",
      "Here's what the club think on the matter >>>",
      "Hello and welcome to the Amorim press conference blog.",
      "The United head coach will be addressing the media today ahead of Sunday's trip to Aston Villa. However, questions on the game could become secondary to what has happened off the pitch since the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "Fernandes is likely to be a big topic of conversation after admitting he felt 'hurt' by the club being open to selling him in the summer. United deny this was the case but the captain's latest comments will be giving Amorim a headache he wasn't expecting.",
      "Mainoo could also be brought up again after his brother's t-shirt stunt in midweek. With Casemiro suspended, the academy graduate could be given a rare start on Sunday.",
      "Stay tuned for all the updates from the press conference..."

      "Welcome to our live Manchester United blog on Friday, December 19, with all the latest transfer news, views and rumours from Old Trafford.",
      "The Reds are just two points adrift of fourth-placed Chelsea, positioning United as serious contenders for a Champions League berth this season. Plans are reportedly underway to reinforce the squad for the latter half of the campaign.",
      "Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo has been heavily linked with reports that United are firmly in the race to sign him. It is said that the Ghanaian has a £65m release clause in his contract which becomes active on January 1.",
      "Other Bournemouth stars Alex Scott and Tyler Adams have also been linked with a switch to M16. Elsewhere, speculation about the future of captain Fernandes has been rife, particularly with interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "A new midfielder has been high on the wish list for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba rumoured to be a target since the summer. Now, it seems Elliot Anderson tops that list, although RC Lens' Mamadou Sangare, Adan Wharton, Noah Sadiki and Ayyoub Bouaddi have also been mentioned.",
      "Follow below for all the latest Man United updates, reactions, analysis and opinions throughout the day...",
      "Ruben Amorim has criticised two Manchester United stars after the duo posted messages on social media in recent days.",
      "Harry Amass and Chido Obi both posted messages on Instagram in response to comments about them by Amorim, with the United head coach now having another say during his latest press conference.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a move for Stuttgart’s midfield engine Angelo Stiller as a potential long-term successor to Bruno Fernandes, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "The 24-year-old has a £35m release clause in his contract. The clause will become active next summer, with Stiller's contract running until 2028. If Stuttgart want to remove this clause, they can do so by paying around £1.7m",
      "Manchester United’s pursuit of Tyler Adams has hit a significant snag following news of a fresh injury setback for the Bournemouth midfielder.",
      "The United States captain, who has been on the radar of the Old Trafford recruitment team, is now facing a further period on the sidelines with a torn MCL, casting doubt over a potential January move.",
      "There was no shortage of relief among the Manchester United fanbase when Bruno Fernandes confirmed he would be staying at Old Trafford this past summer. The offer from the Saudi Pro League will have been tempting for the captain, considering the amount of money which they put on the table for players of Fernandes' quality.",
      "But after consulting his family, and speaking with the United board and manager Ruben Amorim, Fernandes wanted to stay. The captain has since gone on to score five goals and grab seven assists, so far this campaign. In October, the captain reiterated to MEN Sport the talks which settled his future involved the hierarchy.",
      "That is why a new interview with the midfielder, on Portuguese media outlet Canal 11, has been so surprising to all those involved with the club. Fernandes now appears to have contradicted himself, suggesting he felt 'hurt' by what he believed was the implication from United that they were not concerned about losing him.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has insisted it is \"myth\" that players improve automatically after leaving Old Trafford and believes it is too easy to blame the club for personal failures. McTominay left United in the summer of 2024 as Manuel Ugarte arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "While the Uruguayan has struggled, McTominay has moved from strength to strength in Italy. He scored 13 goals in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side and became fundamental to their success as they won Serie A last season.",
      "McTominay has continued in similar form this season and recently finished 18th in the Ballon d'Or ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Declan Rice. The midfielder's success since leaving Old Trafford is not an uncommon theme.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams.",
      "United have been linked with several Premier League midfielders since the summer as they look to strengthen a weak spot in their squad. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been among the names most mentioned, although their hefty price tags may prove to be a stumbling block.",
      "Therefore, Adams may be of greater consideration at M16 ahead of the January transfer window. The Daily Mail report that the 26-year-old has 'cropped up in conversations' over United’s potential midfield targets in January or next summer.",
      "Read more here",
      "Ruben Amorim laid down the law to Manuel Ugarte last month when he told the Manchester United midfielder he had to improve in training to force his way back into his plans. A return of 13 minutes in five Premier League games since then would suggest the message hasn’t been taken on board.",
      "Ugarte hasn’t even made it off the bench in four of those five games and it feels like his Old Trafford career is teetering on the brink amid plans for a major midfield rebuild. Perhaps this weekend will offer the Uruguayan a chance to resuscitate it. It could well be the final chance. With Casemiro suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the season, Ugarte seems like the only possible replacement in that holding midfield role.",
      "If he is overlooked for Kobbie Mainoo, another player Amorim clearly has doubts about, it will surely spell the end for Ugarte. If he plays and doesn’t deliver, it could be just as damning. Last month, Amorim stressed that he wanted to help his former Sporting charge out of his funk, but what has happened since suggests that it hasn’t been achieved.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United are set to be without three key players across the next few weeks with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui all jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament in Morocco kicks off on Sunday with the host nation taking on Comoros. The final takes place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18.",
      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United would nee an 'exceptional offer' to part ways with Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window according to a fresh report. The transfer window is about to open, with a host of clubs being linked with a move for Mainoo over the last few months.",
      "They claim it will take an\"exceptional offer\" to convince Ruben Amorim's side to cash in, with the likes of Chelsea and Napoli linked with a move for the England international.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bruno Fernandes has admitted that his spell at Manchester United hasn't unfolded as he'd envisioned, revealing he had chances to move elsewhere during the club's most turbulent period.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker arrived at Old Trafford in a £47million switch from Sporting CP back in January 2020. While the 31-year-old would have harboured dreams of recreating the silverware-rich success the club enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's iconic reign, matters haven't quite materialised in that fashion under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag, and now, Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has collected just an FA Cup and a League Cup for his contributions in United's midfield, while the club's top-flight displays have also deteriorated since his arrival. Last season witnessed United record their worst-ever Premier League campaign since the competition's launch in 1992, with Amorim's introduction seeing the Reds languish in a disappointing 15th place.",
      "United will reportedly go all-out to sign Antoine Semenyo in January and hope the uncertainty over Pep Guardiola’s future could strengthen their hand.",
      "The Telegraph report United are locked in a four-way tussle with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool for the Bournemouth star.",
      "City want Semenyo, but United are among the suitors out to take advantage of the doubts about whether Guardiola will still be at the Etihad Stadium beyond the end of this season.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and rumours.",
      "The January transfer window is fast approaching and there are plenty of questions over whether the Reds will dip into it to strengthen their squad.",
      "United will also be busy preparing for Sunday's trip to high-flying Aston Villa as they look to continue their push for Champions League football.",
      "Stay with us throughout the day for all the latest!",
      "Manchester United are reportedly looking at a blockbuster move for Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe identifying him as the man to become the club's new icon.",
      "Reports from Spain suggest that initial contact has already been made to explore the possibility of bringing the Brazilian forward to Old Trafford in a deal that could shatter transfer records.",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal are both eyeing a move for Olympiacos midfielder Christos Mouzakitis.",
      "The 18-year-old has impressed in Greece during his two seasons for Olympiacos. Now, according to Area Napoli, Mouzakitis is attracting European interest, including Man United, the Gunners and Napoli.",
      "He is reportedly valued at around £22m - a reasonable price in the current football financial market.",
      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they recieve an 'exceptional offer,' according to The Mirror.",
      "Unless this happens, Ruben Amorim's side have no intentions of letting the United academy graduate go. Mainoo was halted from moving to Napoli over the summer, but it has not been followed with any serious minutes in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim tried to explain his decision to not play Mainoo as he said: \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "Former Wolves star Ruben Neves has emerged as a shock candidate to bolster Manchester United's midfield in January, according to the Daily Mail. The Al-Hilal captain is reportedly available for as little as £20 million, making him an affordable and experienced option for Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "Having spent six years in England, Neves’ familiarity with the Premier League is seen as a major plus for a mid-season move.",
      "While a move to Saudi Arabia originally took him away from Europe, the chance to reunite with fellow countryman Amorim at Old Trafford could prove tempting. At just 28, Neves is a player who could provide immediate leadership and technical quality.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had explained earlier this season that he was \"hurt\" after learning Manchester United were open to selling the midfielder to Saudi Arabia over the summer.",
      "Now, speaking to Rio Ferdinand, the United captain has spoken on club loyalty. He told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could...\"",
      "Manchester United are set to go 'all-out' to sign Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window, according to The Telegraph.",
      "From the start of next month, the Bournemouth star's £65m release clause will become active. This allows a club like United to avoid club negotiations and sign Semenyo directly.",
      "Man City, Liverpool and Tottenham are also said to be targeting the 25-years-old. United are reportedly hoping that uncertainty over Pep Guardiola's future will strengthen their position.",
      "Manchester United have been issued a transfer warning regarding German youngster Said El Mala. Borussia Dortmund learned the hard way in 2024 that the winger will not join any club that doesn't also sign his brother, Malek.",
      "The 19-year-old talent is currently one of the hottest properties in the Bundesliga and has already earned a call-up to the German national team. Reports suggest that United and Spurs are considering a move in the region of £26–35 million for the youngster.",
      "However, any potential suitor must be prepared to accommodate his brother to secure the deal. El Mala previously turned down Dortmund because they only wanted him, emphasizing that his \"close relationship\" with Malek is a non-negotiable part of his future.",
      "Manchester United academy graduate Alvaro Carreras has become a key player for Real Madrid after United decided to sell the young defender - a decision that 'surprised' Old Trafford icon Phil Jones.",
      "He told Sports Illustrated: “Yeah, Incredible. Incredible player. Incredible player. I didn’t think he’d get to that level. Don’t forget he went out on loan to Preston and wasn’t playing that regularly at Preston. He was brilliant.",
      "“And the reason that people would look at him and go ‘maybe not for us’ is because he probably lacked pace.",
      "“And as a left back, he’s tall. He’s got like sort of a really lanky way of running. But I thought he was brilliant. I thought technically he was brilliant. He kept the ball. He never gave the ball away. He was one that surprised me why United let him go.”",
      "Manchester United starlet Kobbie Mainoo has dropped a significant hint about a potential exit after struggling for regular game time under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old midfielder reportedly knew about the \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" message displayed by his brother at Old Trafford.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs suggests that Mainoo was fully aware of his brother's t-shirt stunt and supported the message as he seeks more minutes. With Amorim seemingly moving in a different tactical direction, multiple clubs are reportedly on high alert regarding the youngster's availability.",
      "Whether via a loan or a permanent switch, the pressure is mounting on the club to resolve the future of one of their brightest academy graduates.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly chosen Manuel Ugarte as the primary \"sacrifice\" to fund new arrivals this January. INEOS is said to be taking drastic measures to reshape the squad, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "The Uruguayan midfielder has struggled for game time, starting only two Premier League matches this season. A loan move to OGC Nice is currently seen as the most likely exit path to free up wages and a squad spot.",
      "Offloading Ugarte is viewed as an \"imperative\" step to adding a different dynamic to the United midfield. Amorim is reportedly searching for a profile that better fits his double-pivot system as the club looks to stabilise the squad.",
      "One strategy to create space in the Manchester United squad and budget for new signings is to let go of certain players. A few names have been associated with possible exits recently, most notably midfielder Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The England international was expected to leave during the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli reportedly interested. However, no move materialised and the homegrown player remained at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim's recent remarks about United's emerging talents and his hesitation to utilise them have raised eyebrows. Mainoo wasn't the only one mentioned, with 18 year old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also being highlighted...",
      "There is plenty of interest in Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, should he not remain at Barcelona, according to reports.",
      "The 28-year-old is currently on loan at the La Liga club but it is currently unclear whether he will remain at the Camp Nou beyond the current campaign.",
      "Should he return to United, it has been claimed by CaughtOffside that he is also a target for Barcelona's La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' future at the club is back in the headlines this week after an interview with Portuguese media surfaced on Tuesday.",
      "Conducted in his home country, the midfielder stated he was left 'hurting' by what he felt was the club being uninterested on whether he stayed or left.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has asked its United writers for their thoughts on what happens next with Fernandes and whether the captain should stay or leave at the end of the campaign.",
      "Read what they had to say here...",
      "Manchester United have been criticised by pundit Ian Wright for their treatment of club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The midfielder revealed in a bombshell interview, that was released this week, that the club's hierarchy were willing to offload him during the summer transfer window. However, despite a significant offer on the table from the Saudi Pro League, he admitted they didn't have the courage to completely force him out the door, owing to the fact Ruben Amorim wanted him to stay.",
      "Wright, who represented Arsenal during his playing days, claims United's treatment of Fernandes has been poor, and he would take the Portuguese star at the Emirates Stadium 'tomorow'.",
      "\"It comes back down to the Manchester United indecisiveness,\" Wright said on The Overlap.",
      "\"Someone's come in for Bruno, you shut that down. Because Bruno didn’t want to go. Bruno is saying they said to him, 'well, it’s up to you if you want to leave'.",
      "\"That’s not what you want to hear from someone like him who's literally holding the club up himself.",
      "\"You want the club to say, 'you’re not going nowhere, you’re a massive part of this'. But Man United didn’t do that. They gave him the opportunity to say, 'if you want to stay you can stay, if you want to go, you can go'.",
      "\"What is that saying? I would take him [at Arsenal] tomorrow.\"",
      "It's not been an easy business being a striker for Manchester United in recent years and Benjamin Sesko has found his start to life at Old Trafford to follow a familiar pattern, writes Tyrone Marshall.",
      "Two goals in his first 13 appearances tell the story of a centre-forward still getting to grips with the role.",
      "By contrast, it has been a smoother start to life at United for Bryan Mbeumo, who has quickly become the attack leader and the player in the final third always the likeliest to make something happen.",
      "But with Mbeumo now away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), United need someone to step forward, and this feels like the moment Sesko can really make his mark on a new club.",
      "Read the full comment here.",
      "Roma have already identified a potential alternative target as a move for Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee stalls, according to reports.",
      "The Italian club have been heavily linked with the Dutchman of late, as speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford continues to grow.",
      "That said, with little sign of progress in negotiations and a deal so far, it appears Roma may already be shifting their attention elsewhere.",
      "According to Football Italia, Atletico Madrid's Giacomo Raspadori is also a leading target for the club.",
      "Lazio have also been linked with the player, but Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini is said to appreciate the 25-year-ol.d",
      "United have made contact over a deal to sign Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo, according to the latest from journalist Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Ghana international is a target for a number of top Premier League clubs ahead of the January window, including United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs, due to the presence of a £65 million release clause active until a certain date in January.",
      "Speaking on his Youtube Channel, Romano explained the latest involving United: \"For Semenyo, the situation is really heating up.",
      "\"This week, Manchester United and Manchester City called to understand the situation of Semenyo. From Monday to Tuesday, some calls took place from Man United and Man City to understand the situation of Semenyo who has a £65m release clause.",
      "\"These clubs all called. Liverpool called in November and are now assessing what they want to do, both in January and with Mo Salah, before deciding on Semenyo.",
      "“More than money, more than financial fair play, it’s the player who is deciding.”"

      "Ruben Amorim laid down the law to Manuel Ugarte last month when he told the Manchester United midfielder he had to improve in training to force his way back into his plans. A return of 13 minutes in five Premier League games since then would suggest the message hasn’t been taken on board.",
      "Ugarte hasn’t even made it off the bench in four of those five games and it feels like his Old Trafford career is teetering on the brink amid plans for a major midfield rebuild. Perhaps this weekend will offer the Uruguayan a chance to resuscitate it. It could well be the final chance. With Casemiro suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the season, Ugarte seems like the only possible replacement in that holding midfield role.",
      "If he is overlooked for Kobbie Mainoo, another player Amorim clearly has doubts about, it will surely spell the end for Ugarte. If he plays and doesn’t deliver, it could be just as damning. Last month, Amorim stressed that he wanted to help his former Sporting charge out of his funk, but what has happened since suggests that it hasn’t been achieved.",
      "“You can sense a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" he said. \"He is struggling at the moment but it is our job to try to help and help him to feel like I felt when he was a Sporting player. But it is a different world. He needs to adapt, and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "It was the second time Amorim had been brutal about Ugarte, telling him after the Europa League final that he wasn’t the same player that the head coach encountered in Lisbon. Their shared history together should have been a significant advantage to Ugarte. He knew Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system, he had a head start when it came to the demands of the Portuguese and what he wanted from players in Ugarte’s position. But he hasn’t put it to good use.",
      "Ugarte left Sporting to join Paris Saint-Germain and managed a year in Ligue 1 before United spent £50.5m on him. His confidence looks to have been rocked by a tricky year in Paris and the chaos of Old Trafford.",
      "He wasn’t Erik ten Hag’s first choice for that position in the summer of 2024 and had a sluggish start to his time at the club. Amorim’s arrival led to a brief renaissance but there has been very little evidence across 18 months that Ugarte is going to cut the mustard.",
      "An exit in January might be unlikely, especially if Mainoo leaves on loan, but a summer transfer is a possibility, especially if Ugarte doesn’t find the improvement required.",
      "The future of every United midfielder is up in the air at the moment, for one reason or another. For Ugarte, the reason is his own performances, and what happens next is largely in his hands. He can take a step forward at Villa Park on Sunday, but if he doesn’t it could push him closer to the exit door.",

      "He has now missed five matches, a period during which the team has conceded eight goals.",
      "Amorim has taken a cautious approach with the 32-year-old’s recovery, choosing not to rush him back despite the team’s current defensive crisis. A comeback for the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle United is still possible.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt is currently dealing with a back injury that has kept him out of the last three fixtures against West Ham, Wolves, and Bournemouth.",
      "The injury is not believed to be severe as Amorim previously described it as a \"small thing.\"",
      "However, because De Ligt has been a mainstay in Amorim's three-man defence, the club is exercising extreme caution to avoid a long-term setback. Like Maguire, there is a possibility he could feature against Newcastle.",
      "After his goal in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last Monday, Casemiro received a yellow card for a foul on Marcus Tavernier.",
      "As it was his fifth of the season the Brazilian will serve a one-game suspension against Villa, then return to the squad on Boxing Day against Newcastle United.",

      "The Elephants have scheduled group stage fixtures against Mozambique (Dec 24), Cameroon (Dec 28) and Gabon (Dec 31). In this space he would miss three United matches and were his country to be a shock casualty of the group stage, he would return back in time for the league match against Leeds United on January 4, 2026.",
      "But Ivory Coast are tipped to go deep into the tournament, therefore Amad could be required to play for his country as late as the AFCON final on January 18, 2026. If so, he would miss seven club matches in total.",
      "Following on, Bryan Mbeumo is in the same situation and will represent Cameroon.",
      "They have group stage games against Gabon (Dec 24), Ivory Coast (Dec 28) and Mozambique (Dec 31). Similarly, the attacker could be back in Manchester in time to play against Leeds if his country don't make it beyond the first hurdle.",
      "Knockout stage qualification will only increase Mbeumo's absence, which again could extend seven matches in total.",
      "Finally, Noussair Mazraoui will represent tournament hosts Morocco at AFCON in the coming weeks.",
      "His country have scheduled group stage matches against Comoros (Dec 21), Mali (Dec 26), and Zambia (Dec 29). Were a major shock to take place and the hosts be eliminated this early on, the full-back would miss only three United matches and be eligible to return against Leeds.",

      "Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League saw Mainoo make an appearance from the bench, where the 20-year-old received a warm reception from the Old Trafford crowd.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a move away from United in recent months. With the January transfer window fast approaching, it remains to be seen what the future holds.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are just some of the clubs that have been credited with an interest in signing Mainoo over the last few weeks, although reports have claimed that United have no plans to let the midfielder leave Old Trafford in January despite the speculation.",
      "Shearer has now explained why it may be in Mainoo's best interest to leave United, and why a move may, in turn, also help the Reds.",
      "\"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo. Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue,\" Shearer told Betfair.",
      "\"And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants. And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them. And that looks as if it's going to be the case for him.",
      "\"I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like. But I guess looking from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards.",

      "Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson believes it could be at least 10 years before the Reds are battling for the Premier League title and insists he has sympathy for Ruben Amorim. Since the Portuguese head coach took over in November 2024, it has been difficult for United.",
      "Amorim chose to sacrifice the Premier League last season to concentrate on the most likely route to the Champions League through the Europa League. However, this plan backfired as United lost to Tottenham in an underwhelming final. The Reds would go on to finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Since then, United have shown signs of improvement with the attack looking stronger and the Reds currently sitting sixth. However, there are still concerns about Amorim's tactics, with many criticising his reluctance to deviate from a three-at-the-back system, albeit this stance has softened recently due to absentees.",
      "Speaking to Press Box PR, Ferguson believes United are still on a long journey to the force they once were under him. He said: \"He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy. I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee's knees.",
      "\"They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again. We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle.",
      "\"It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.\" While Ferguson is pessimistic about United going for the title any time soon, he did provide some comfort for supporters.",
      "\"I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,\" he added. \"He's young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has insisted it is \"myth\" that players improve automatically after leaving Old Trafford and believes it is too easy to blame the club for personal failures. McTominay left United in the summer of 2024 as Manuel Ugarte arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "While the Uruguayan has struggled, McTominay has moved from strength to strength in Italy. He scored 13 goals in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side and became fundamental to their success as they won Serie A last season.",
      "McTominay has continued in similar form this season and recently finished 18th in the Ballon d'Or ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Declan Rice. The midfielder's success since leaving Old Trafford is not an uncommon theme.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund have all impressed in spells since leaving Old Trafford recently. But in an interview with CBS Sports, McTominay said it is too easy to suggest the Reds are the problem. He said: \"It’s just too easy of an excuse to say: ‘Oh, they left Man United and now they are doing well.’",
      "\"In my last year, I did well. I scored ten goals and we won a trophy and with Marcus [Rashford] there was obviously different issues which might have transpired which we won’t go into. However, Marcus is a top player and he’s always been a top player.",
      "\"He’s one of the club’s legends and he scored so many goals for Manchester United, done so many great things but because the spotlight is directly on you, it makes it seem a lot worse, in my opinion. Obviously when players go away and they are playing more, they are going to have an increase in confidence and feel better about themselves, rather than playing less minutes for Man United, for example.",
      "\"When you are at Man United, you have to earn those minutes like Bruno Fernandes who has done incredibly well. I think it is too easy to probably say that.\" When asked if getting away from the British media storm is also beneficial for players leaving the club, McTominay said it is a factor but perhaps not the main reason.",
      "The midfielder added: \"There are some players who leave and who we don’t speak about so much. But there are players who everybody speaks about so it depends on the individual and for me I think it is too easy an excuse to blame Man United as a club because when I was there, they did everything for me.",
      "\"They helped me with nutrition, they helped me with training, they helped me tactically - whoever the manager is. Everything is put there for you to succeed. It is not like they don’t give you certain things which other clubs do.",
      "\"So the myth they go away and become better players comes down to confidence. If you go away and you are playing every single game and you score and you score again, people start speaking [about you and] you feel good about yourself and you want to continue in that way.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has admitted that his spell at Manchester United hasn't unfolded as he'd envisioned, revealing he had chances to move elsewhere during the club's most turbulent period.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker arrived at Old Trafford in a £47million switch from Sporting CP back in January 2020. While the 31-year-old would have harboured dreams of recreating the silverware-rich success the club enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's iconic reign, matters haven't quite materialised in that fashion under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag, and now, Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has collected just an FA Cup and a League Cup for his contributions in United's midfield, while the club's top-flight displays have also deteriorated since his arrival. Last season witnessed United record their worst-ever Premier League campaign since the competition's launch in 1992, with Amorim's introduction seeing the Reds languish in a disappointing 15th place, reports the Mirror.",
      "The club also fell short of claiming the Europa League crown in May, following a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has now looked back on his Old Trafford journey.",
      "When Ferdinand questioned him about his affection for the club, the United skipper responded: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes had spoken to Ferdinand earlier this month, before a recent interview surfaced in which he alleged that the United board were eager to see him leave during the summer transfer window. Saudi powerhouses Al-Hilal were prepared to offer United £100m for Fernandes' signature, but the attacking midfielder chose to remain at Old Trafford instead.",
      "The club were also reportedly prepared to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have netted him approximately £100m across a three-year deal. Now, the playmaker has indicated that whilst Amorim was keen for him to stay, the United executives were eager to cash in.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, he said: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, 'I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.'",
      "\"But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay.",
      "\"But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about.",
      "\"I'm always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much...that makes you sad.\"",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

The tournament in Morocco kicks off on Sunday with the host nation taking on Comoros. The final takes place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18.",
      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "Meanwhile, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to fall at the group stages - meaning he could be available for United again away at Leeds on January 4, should that come to pass.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "The Supercomputer also predicts that Senegal will oust Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a resounding 3-0 win. However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction reckons Amad is also likely to return at a similar time to Mazraoui for the Arsenal game in late January.",
      "In what could be the tournament's biggest upset, Egypt and their star player Mohamed Salah are predicted to fall to Comoros with a 1-0 loss in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both of whom have qualified for next year's World Cup, are expected to reach the quarter-finals, while Tunisia, another World Cup participant, is predicted to miss out on the knockout stages.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui out for the foreseeable future and former United defender Paul Parker believes it will be a very difficult task.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is open to a permanent move away from Old Trafford as he doesn’t see a future at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made 11 appearances off the substitutes’ bench in the Premier League – but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",

      "Despite initial rumours he only wanted to leave on a temporary deal, the Daily Mail claims that Mainoo ‘would now consider’ loan deals with permanent transfer options included in the agreement.",
      "The Man Utd midfielder’s ‘relationship with his boyhood club is now at breaking point’ with no fresh contract proposal on the table for a player who earns £40k a week, a lot less than most of his colleagues in the first team.",
      "The Daily Mail adds: ‘Mainoo sees no future for himself at Old Trafford under Amorim, and if a loan move in January included an option to leave permanently, then he would now consider it.",
      "‘Napoli are still at the front of the queue and there is a growing optimism in southern Italy that Antonio Conte will get his man this time, reuniting Mainoo with Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.’",
      "Mainoo’s brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, protested his brother’s place on the substitutes’ bench on Monday by wearing a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ t-shirt to their 4-4 draw against Bournemouth at Old Trafford.",
      "Reacting to his brother’s actions, Amorim said of the t-shirt: “No [it won’t affect team selection]. It was not Kobbie who wore the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel he is the right guy. That is not an issue. I am not going to do something to Kobbie because of someone in his family.”",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed why he is not confident about Manchester United’s chances of winning the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave permanently in January if they receive an ‘exceptional’ offer.",
      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United’s youngsters are having ‘tantrums’ by posting images of themselves with trophies on Instagram. Disgusting.",

      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on new players over the summer transfer window with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backing Ruben Amorim in the market.",
      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last season and Man Utd invested most of their summer cash into their forward line with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arriving.",
      "Many fans and former players were disappointed that Man Utd didn’t manage to bring in a midfielder with the position an obvious area for improvement after last season.",

      "However, there may have to be some outgoings too with Spanish website Fichajes insisting that Man Utd ‘have decided to take drastic measures to shape their squad according to Ruben Amorim’s demands.’",
      "Ugarte has been chosen as a ‘sacrifice’ for January and Man Utd ‘have decided to look for a way out’ for the Uruguay international this winter.",
      "The ‘absolute priority is to give the midfield a different dynamic’ with it ‘imperative to lighten the current squad, and therefore they are looking to offload the Uruguayan midfielder’.",
      "Ugarte has started just two Premier League matches this season with French side Nice keen to do a deal for the 24-year-old ahead of January.",
      "The report adds: ‘OGC Nice, a club with strong institutional ties through INEOS, appears to be the leading candidate to acquire the Uruguayan midfielder on loan. This move would allow Manchester United to free up a strategic roster spot and reduce their wage bill, enabling them to make an immediate impact signing this winter. Amorim is looking for a specific profile that can integrate into his characteristic double pivot and rotate with figures of the calibre of Casemiro. Manuel Ugarte’s situation reflects the urgent need for changes in a midfield that has shown a lack of pace in recent defensive transitions.’",
      "Fichajes continues: ‘Negotiations are expected to intensify after the holiday period, with the aim of bringing in the new signing in the first few days of next year. Manuel Ugarte ‘s departure would financially facilitate a transfer that the Red fans are demanding to stabilize a squad that has suffered too many setbacks.’",

      "When asked if Forest have a fight on their hands to keep the England international, Harewood told Goal: “Yes, massively. I’m actually really surprised that Newcastle let him go. But with all the fair play and everything that is going on with the rules and regulations, it was good for Forest to get him in the squad.",
      "“He has really excelled. He has become one of the true Premier League midfielders that you can see go on and excel and do well. Yes, Forest will do well to keep him. If they keep him for the rest of the season it would be good, but I can see people coming in for him in January.”",
      "When asked whether the Man Utd target was worth the £100m quoted, Harewood added: “He is definitely one of those players. If someone said that and put that price tag, with the money that’s going on in the game over the last couple of years, he is definitely worth the price tag and I think he will go on and do really well at whatever club he is at.",
      "“I hope Forest can keep him for the rest of the season so that they can do what they need to do this year.”",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is open to a permanent move away from Old Trafford as he doesn’t see a future at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim.",

      "It wasn’t Kobbie Mainoo who called for Manchester United to ‘FREE KOBBIE MAINOO’, so we can hardly lay the blame at that particular Manchester United youngster’s door.",

      "Those ‘ripostes’ are as weak as the ‘juice’ on an all-inclusive holiday. Amass posted an image of his Player of the Month trophy at Sheffield Wednesday and Chido Obi a picture of him scoring for Manchester United’s Under-21s. ‘Tantrums’? Really? We guess it was apt after the ‘rampage’.",

How do they expect to handle the Old Trafford pressure cooker if this is the reaction to a few ill-judged words?",

Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",

That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",

      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",

      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options that prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",

      "Gary Neville has backed Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher over his Mohamed Salah comments by using a Cristiano Ronaldo comparison.",

      "Salah was serenaded by the Kop after the match but it still feels like his time as a Liverpool player is coming to an end with rumours of his imminent departure over the next two transfer windows.",
      "Carragher called out Salah’s comments as a “disgrace” with the Liverpool legend getting criticised in some quarters for his strong words.",

      "Neville said on The Overlap podcast: “My reaction to the Cristiano Ronaldo interview a few years back was similar to Carra’s reaction to Salah.",
      "“I would have said the same thing if it was a United player. If you are a special player at that level, I am expecting you to lift everyone, not create more problems. I understand why these players do what they do but I didn’t agree with it.",

      "“He got a goal the other night [against Wolves] – he wasn’t playing as a six when he got his goal. I always thought a midfield player had to do a bit of everything – defensive work when needed, be creative when needed, and maybe chip in with a few goals.",
      "“That’s what Bruno’s doing right now. He is their go-to man. He’s easily their most talented player. But he has shortcomings. I still don’t like him waving his arms and telling other people what to do all the time. Slightly frustrating. I couldn’t have played with him if he was like that.”",

      "And he is above all an English manager of the Spoke Well, I Thought school who looks like he listens to and carefully transcribes every single episode of the High Performance Podcast so he can really drink in all the valuable life lessons contained within at his leisure later.",
      "Which an awful lot of the press pack in this country think is correct and good behaviour. They like Howe, who has no dubious foreign ways, speaks to them politely if with those eerie dead eyes of his, and there’s also clearly a lucrative ghost-writing deal for his autobiography out there for someone at some point down the line.",
      "So yeah, we get all the reasons why the Newcastle boat remains so entirely unrocked.",
      "But also aren’t they really quite sh*t? Like far, far sh*tter than it’s remotely necessary or acceptable for them to be in their Champions League-and-Saudi era? They are quite literally as bad as Tottenham, and Howe doesn’t even have Thomas Frank’s flimsy ‘I’m new here and this club is batsh*t’ excuse. And Frank is under immense pressure now.",
      "Yet there’s Eddie Howe, just carrying on, his team showing desperately little fight and almost zero bottle in going down to a tame defeat in the first Premier League Tyne-Wear Derby in nearly a decade.",
      "That’s not really acceptable is it, surely?",
      "They really shouldn’t be as bad as this, stumbling along at the back of a deeply mediocre mid-table peloton, seemingly incapable of stitching together the kind of run that would get them out of there.",
      "We’re not asking for Aston Villa-style ridiculousness here, but it does seem reasonable to think they shouldn’t be getting left behind by Brighton or Everton. Or most pointedly Sunderland, who now sit four points clear of their local rivals.",
      "There’s a couple more things that explain the apparent lack of panic at Newcastle. That mid-table is awfully congested. Villa have already sauntered clean through it and out the other side. Everton had a little go at being fifth. Man United have been sixth here and there.",
      "Feels like that’s a dangerous mindset that could easily lead a daft big club into trouble, but it’s also reasonable to be less bent out of shape about being 12th when the top five is four points away rather than 10.",
      "The other thing is that the fact there is absolutely no peril or jeopardy in the Champions League now – we designed it that way – means Newcastle are in no danger of messing that up in the way they ultimately (if slightly unfortunately) did a couple of years ago. They’ve hit the odd wrinkle, but still sit four points above the generous 24th-place cut line with two games to go.",
      "We still can’t quite shake the sense, though, that Newcastle are having really quite a bad season, one that reinforces the growing idea that they can’t put two good seasons together and compete on all fronts, and nobody seems to be losing their sh*t about it.",
      "That’s no good at all. We thought this was Modern Football with all its instant gratification and baying for blood.",
      "What’s going on here?",
      "",
      "You do feel that at some point the wind is going to change and Bournemouth will be stuck permanently in one of their two guises. The key will be whether that’s the Champions League-form or relegation-form versions of Bournemouth. Because they really are never anything else.",
      "Their first nine games of this season brought five wins, three draws and a solitary defeat at Liverpool which was way back in the before times when nobody realised that was actually quite bad.",
      "Their seven subsequent Premier League games have delivered no wins and four defeats.",
      "The possible good news is that draws with Chelsea and Man United that currently sit in the ‘relegation form’ section could yet in fact be the start of another ‘Champions League form’ run.",
      "With Burnley and Brentford up next, we’ll know more by year’s end.",
      "",
      "Riding high in November on the back of a brilliant win over Newcastle, but it’s been a distinctly bump-based return to earth since then.",
      "The Newcastle game was the third in a brilliant triptych of autumn home wins also featuring Man United and Liverpool, and even now it’s still going far better for the Bees than many (let’s be honest here: we) expected and there is still some distance between them and the real strugglers.",
      "But not the distance there once was. They’ve won only once in the last month, and that was against Burnley which is mandatory anyway. Tricky away games at Brighton and Arsenal have gone as you might expect, but there really is no excuse for anyone losing a league game at Spurs this season. Not even Wolves did that.",
      "A home draw with Leeds represents a missed chance to put more distance between themselves and trouble, and they’re now out of the Carabao as well.",
      "We don’t wish to paint too gloomy a picture, but this is a team we ranked fifth last time out.",
      "Still, though: it’s not all bad news: Wolves next. The ultimate Christmas present.",
      "",
      "Have inexplicably and incredibly irritatingly spent a second consecutive December talking themselves out of the title race for absolutely no good reason. Truly maddening stuff, especially on the back of fighting so, so hard to prove exactly why they could compete for the title in that 10-man draw with Arsenal – which was the same week they dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.",
      "Have stumbled in that competition as well with defeat to Atalanta leaving them likely facing the unwanted hassle of the play-off round.",
      "Chelsea have reached the semi-finals of the Carabao, although presumably Enzo Maresca thinks it’s just plain daft to talk about them maybe winning it when so many other good teams are involved.",
      "",
      "Tentatively encouraging signs, on the field at least. They played well in Champions League victory at Inter before a solid home win over Brighton. Their next two league games are at Tottenham, which generally proves to be a lift for Liverpool spirits and absolutely should do this time, and then at home to Wolves.",
      "Every chance they hit 2026 on a four-game winning run and then an instant chance to kick off the new year by putting right what went wrong at Leeds the other week.",
      "And with absolutely no off-field drama whatsoever to worry themselves with, it’s all looking far rosier than it did even a couple of weeks ago, never mind at the time of the last Moods.",
      "",
      "We didn’t really expect Daniel Farke to still be here for this update. Leeds had lost four of their previous five Premier League games at that point and were heading into an absolutely brutal run of games: Villa, City, Chelsea, Liverpool.",
      "They duly lost the first two, but then took four points from a pair of riotously encouraging and potentially season-turning performances against Chelsea and Liverpool. Then followed that up with a point at Brentford, which is an absolutely acceptable result for pretty much anyone there; it’s more than Man United, Liverpool or Newcastle have managed there already this season.",
      "They remain under serious and obvious threat of relegation, but to be approaching the halfway stage of the season on an apparent upward curve, outside the bottom three and with the same manager they began the season with? It’s not too bad at all.",
      "",
      "Here’s what we said a month ago:",
      "Proving to be the most gloriously mid-table team imaginable, achieving that middle-of-the-road outcome via the most outlandish means possible.",
      "And a month later… here we still are. They have now, sadly, lost the dream of going through the entire season without having the same result in consecutive games – last month’s wins over Brentford and Forest put paid to that.",
      "But that is still the only time it’s happened to Brighton all season. A team that has beaten four of last season’s top seven already this season remain determined to have it count for as little as possible. And we respect that.",
      "In a congested mid-table built on endless shifts and flux, one where all positions between fifth and 14th seem to be handed out at random week by week, Brighton are 10th and it feels like they are always 10th. Seems churlish, considering that, to put them anywhere other than that here.",
      "",
      "Really did look like they were going to do something quite silly and bin Marco Silva for a while there. It would have been a catastrophic misjudgement. Fulham and Silva is one of those combinations that just works. Neither would be as good without the other; both should think long and hard before even considering the temptation to look elsewhere.",
      "The end of the Carabao adventure is a disappointment for a club who have seen peers claim silverware recently but three league wins in the last five – and a stirring if ultimately not quite successful comeback against City – have at least quietened the noise suggesting they might be about to do something stupid.",
      "In our best Mark Lawrenson voice: They’ll be fine.",
      "",
      "A month ago we demanded to be told whether Man United are good now, or what. Still none the wiser, frankly.",
      "The mood at Manchester United has definitely shifted over the last couple of months, but – as with the team itself – we’d stop some way short of calling it a good mood.",
      "Indeed, that is the very crux of the current problem for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "They are no longer utterly, humiliatingly mortifying. That deep sense of embarrassment at being just so profoundly sh*t that United felt throughout last season and into the start of this one has now dissipated.",
      "The stain of finishing where they finished last season and bottling a cup final against a Tottenham – Tottenham! – side apparently being player-managed on the fly by Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven will never truly come off. And nor should it.",
      "You don’t have to be This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About for that to be an unacceptable season. There can exist no mitigation that justifies finishing 15th and collecting fewer league wins than a Wolves team now making a historic attempt at knocking Derby County off their f*cking perch.",
      "That shame will always be there. Grimsby will always be there.",
      "But it’s fair to say now that those very darkest days do appear to be behind United. Things still aren’t perfect by any stretch. At almost any other period of United’s Premier League history their current effort would be a poor one, and that itself is part of the problem for anyone trying to turn this ship around.",
      "Even after the historic lows of last season even the significant current improvement doesn’t constitute success.",
      "And herein lies the ongoing niggle. United are now at the very least competent. That doesn’t sound like much, and it isn’t, but it’s a huge step up from last season. Competence is welcome at this stage.",
      "But with it have already come some extremely irritating missed opportunities. Last year’s incompetence may have only slightly dampened expectations, with the club’s own stated aims for this season a nine-place leap into the top six, but it has handed United another advantage.",
      "It’s not the advantage any club of United’s stature wants, but the absence altogether of any European football – with the Grimsby debacle almost eliminating midweek football altogether – offers United benefits that none of their theoretical rivals can enjoy.",
      "And they just keep refusing to fully accept those chances. They have dragged themselves towards the top of the mid-table peloton but they really could have got themselves into something approaching Villa’s current situation.",
      "United have only lost once in seven Premier League games since the start of November, but it’s a run riddled with annoyance and frustration.",
      "The defeat was a ludicrous one, at home against a good-not-great Everton side who handed United an absurd early advantage by friendly-firing themselves down to 10 men.",
      "And the other six games in that run have all been against distinctly beatable opponents. The league positions for the seven teams at the time United played them were 18th, 6th, 13th, 5th, 17th, 20th and 13th.",
      "The sixth-placed team was Tottenham, who we now know to be more rubbish than that, and the fifth-placed one was Palace, who United beat. The only other win was against the team in 20th, who we don’t think we need identify by name.",
      "In the last seven weeks United have drawn four games against opposition of bottom-half standard. And they have been in front in every single one of those games. In three of them they have led going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Sure, at Spurs they ended up salvaging a point in the last seconds but only after throwing away a winning position with six minutes of regular time remaining.",
      "West Ham equalised on 83 minutes at Old Trafford, and Bournemouth 84 in a game United had already led twice and trailed once before getting their noses in front with 11 minutes to go.",
      "And such is the congested nature of the league table that these spaffed points really, really hurt. They have had so many chances now to get themselves into the (likely) Champions League places and every time they seem to sabotage themselves, very often infuriatingly late on in games.",
      "Ifs and buts are candy and nuts, but when the table is so tight it is impossible to resist thinking about what might have been. There is a compelling case to make that United could have won every single one of their last seven league games, which is good. Instead, they have won only two.",
      "Even turning two of the five failures into the wins United really should have managed would be enough to have them in top four now. You might even, if you wanted to be entirely reckless, talk about them being on the fringes of the title race.",
      "Instead: there they still are in the mid-table bunch, still having to worry every bit as much about what’s behind them as ahead of them, still in danger of slipping right back into mid-table should they stumble again.",
      "So yes; it’s much better than it was. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",
      "",
      "A couple of vaguely alarming home defeats to the Manchester clubs are mood-dampeners, but the main thing keeping all things from being deliriously cheery for Palace is the long-term future of Oliver Glasner.",
      "It is the way of the world and Palace fans know their place in it. He will not be there for much longer but wonderful things have happened – and in a way entirely sustainable if they get the next appointment anywhere near as correct as this one – and continue to happen.",
      "Never mind what comes next for now. Palace are competing in the top six of the Premier League and on cup fronts European and domestic. They have never known days like these.",
      "",
      "Phew. Dycheball is doing the necessary, and then some. Let us never speak of Angeball and the most predictable Premier League disaster of all time ever again.",
      "",
      "Is it happening again? It does feel like it might be happening again. We’re not even really sure Arsenal have done a lot wrong. But you can entirely understand The Fear after a run of iffy away results and then a truly honking if still somehow just about good/lucky enough performance against Wolves.",
      "It says a lot about that performance that escaping with a last-gasp win when not playing well is usually your classic Hallmark of Champions territory. But Arsenal were so bad, so panicky when 1-0 up at home against what may yet go down as the worst Premier League team in history it actually became what might be the first in an entirely new genre: a match win that makes you less likely to win the title.",
      "That seems silly. Even as we write it, it seems silly. But it felt true at the time, and doubly so after especially Man City but even Aston Villa with another come-from-behind special recorded far more impressive wins from far tougher assignments the following day.",
      "A weekend that ended up ‘as you were’ on paper didn’t really feel that way in the gut.",
      "We’re not saying anything is f*cked for the league leaders who still have the best team and squad in the league, but surely everyone involved will feel a little more comfortable if they can quite swiftly find a convincing league performance.",
      "And their next few games are ticklish. Everton away is a funny one, because some teams – even crap ones – have found it very easy there and others absolutely have not, while after that it’s Brighton. You never know what to expect from Brighton but they can be extremely mischievous when put up against one of the bigger boys.",
      "And then it’s Aston Villa again. Hmm.",
      "",
      "We were very, very harsh on Everton in the last update. What we were cross about was that we wanted Everton be lots of fun this season and they’d only been quite fun. It was childish of us.",
      "But listen, fair play. Everton have taken it on board. Since that update they’ve gone down to 10 men in the opening minutes at Old Trafford after a fight between two of their own players and still gone on to win. In consecutive home games they’ve been beaten 4-1 and then won 3-0.",
      "They are in absolutely no danger of relegation, and at one point for a brief time even jumped up to fifth place in the table to the widespread delight and wide-eyed surprise of all.",
      "This is what we wanted from Everton in their first season at the Hill Dickinson. Plenty of fun, and no real existential drama or stress. They are now firmly on course.",
      "",
      "If the 24/25 season had an overriding theme it was the ending of trophy droughts.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first major silverware in their history. Newcastle won their first trophy that wasn’t in, well, black and white and even Tottenham ended the most discussed trophy drought of all, in the most Tottenham way imaginable and have since sacked or moved on almost everyone involved in such a hideously off-brand endeavour.",
      "But there was another story rumbling along in the background of all this drought-ending catharsis and joy. And it might have been, in its own roundabout way, just as necessary.",
      "For while all those droughts were ending, something almost as unthinkable was happening in Manchester: Guardiola and City won absolutely nothing unless you count the Community Shield which you absolutely should not. That is just not how things are supposed to be these days.",
      "It was City and Guardiola’s first trophyless season since his very first in England back in 20216/17. And it really might have been just what City needed.",
      "It’s not that there was massive complacency. Certainly older City supporters need no reminding that what they’ve experienced over the last decade is not normal, not Typical City.",
      "But for younger fans it was a more unusual experience; even in the years before Pep turned City into English football’s dominant force there was still success on a scale most clubs never experience ever in their history.",
      "Between 2010/11 and 2014/15, City won two league titles and finished second twice as well as an FA Cup and League Cup. And that was the bit before the gold rush.",
      "Since Guardiola’s arrival, City have won six more league titles, a Champions League, four Carabaos, a couple of FA Cups, A UEFA Super Cup and a Club World Cup.",
      "It is a lot of stuff. Even the most well-adjusted fanbase is going to get a bit blasé about it. How could you not? It’s inevitable.",
      "But a year of going without – especially one like 24/25 where City didn’t even really mount any kind of meaningful challenge for the two top honours – can have a reinvigorating effect.",
      "It certainly seems to have done so for Guardiola himself, who last season often appeared to have grown entirely weary of the whole thing. There were long spells where it wouldn’t have surprised us at all to hear he’d decided to leave in the summer a la Klopp. We’re certain he contemplated it.",
      "But now he’s got the scent in his nostrils again. He’s got a new-look team. It’s not quite as precise and efficient a machine as his very best City teams but in its way all the more charming for that.",
      "Above all, he’s once again caught up in the thrill of the chase. Worth remembering that after back-to-back early-season defeats to Spurs and Brighton it felt entirely reasonable to wonder whether City, so dominant so recently, would once again have to settle for the role of mere spectator and occasional agitator in the title race.",
      "They still don’t fully convince us. They still don’t quite have that look of champions about them. But that might be the most exciting thing of all; that for all the doubts, for all their flaws, for all the uncertainty, there they sit, right on the shoulders of Arsenal.",
      "Both these teams have been here before. Both know how that played out.",
      "City and their trophy-hoarding manager can smell blood in the water and are suddenly right up for this.",
      "Sometimes it really can be the ground left fallow for a year that proves the most fertile.",
      "",
      "A team that probably shouldn’t even have got promoted – they finished 24 points behind Leeds and Burnley and even 14 behind Sheffield United having ended the regular season in horror form – now absolutely ripping it up in the Premier League? Wonderful.",
      "First things first, they (although we must acknowledge Wolves’ selfless assist here) have already pretty much guaranteed we won’t be seeing the three promoted teams go straight back down which is a hugely welcome development. And if the three promoted teams do now all go down, then, well, we’re in for a truly astonishing second half of the season anyway so that’s also fine.",
      "More likely, though, is that Sunderland continuing knocking about in the rarefied top-half air they currently breathe. Even if they don’t in fact end up level on points with Liverpool and separated only on goals scored when the music finally stops in May.",
      "There are all sorts of ambitions you could reasonably have for the remainder of Sunderland’s season. They could definitely qualify for Europe, for instance, which would be a spectacular bit of work.",
      "Our goal for them is, inevitably, more mischief-based. We want them to reach 59 points. Why 59? Because it’s the sum total the three promoted teams Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton managed last season.",
      "At present speed and course, Sunderland get 61 points. We are watching, and hoping that AFCON doesn’t blast too big a hole in our dreams and/or Sunderland’s season before the next update.",
      "",
      "After five games of the season, Aston Villa had three points and had just managed their first goal of the campaign after a nevertheless disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "It looked for all the world like last season’s Champions League near-miss after getting f*cked over at Old Trafford on the final day had ruined them. That something fundamental had been broken.",
      "That slow start to the season came on the back of a difficult summer, where Villa were unable to do the business they wanted to do and were hamstrung to a large extent by their continued flirtation with the very edges of the PSR regulations. Even now, it still feels like something quite bad is being stored up for the future there.",
      "But never mind all that now. Because since those five games in which Villa managed three points and one measly goal, they’ve scored 24 in a further 11. And rather ludicrously won 10 of them.",
      "Their late winner against Arsenal prompted absolute cinema in the reactions of the Gunners, but it was also one of the most significant three-point swings of the season, one swing of Emi Buendia’s right foot turning a six-point gap to Arsenal to a three-point one.",
      "Villa have even since then passed up the traditional opportunity for such over-achieving clubs to chucklef*ck their way back out of a title race the moment they unexpectedly find themselves in it.",
      "A trip to West Ham in which they found themselves behind in the first minute and trailing again by half-time looked to be going entirely to that script, but no. The run continues. Where will it end? When will it end? What if it never ends? Is there a plan in place for that? Has anyone put a plan in place for that? Guys? GUYS?",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 15:18, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in Under-21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 13:26, UK",
      "He may be in his third season at Old Trafford, but it finally seems that Manchester United fans are starting to see the best of Mason Mount.",
      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League card and tips up a 13/1 weekend treble with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""

      "AFCON 2025 kicks off this weekend with those Premier League players involved having reported for duty with their national teams; Between the Lines examines which clubs are most and least impacted by the tournament",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Joe Watson",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Premier League players taking part in AFCON 2025 departed to join up with their national teams this week ahead of the tournament opener on Sunday, when hosts Morocco face Comoros.",
      "The players called up could be absent for over a month, with the final of the tournament scheduled for January 18. So which Premier League clubs will be the most and least impacted?",
      "Between the Lines drills into the numbers and looks at the challenge facing some clubs to adapt, including Manchester United.",
      "A total of 32 Premier League players are taking part in the tournament, representing 14 of the 24 competing nations.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Sunderland are losing the most players with six. Their total is double that of any other Premier League club and the highest by any club across Europe's major leagues.",
      "It includes two players who have played important roles defensively in holding midfielder Noah Sadiki and left-back Reinildo.",
      "The pair have helped the Black Cats keep five clean sheets so far this season in the Premier League, the latest coming in Sunday's Wear-Tyne derby, during which they played the full 90 minutes.",
      "Manchester United are losing three players in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, as are Fulham, in Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwuemeze, and Burnley, in Lyle Foster, Hannibal Mejbri and Axel Tuanzebe.",
      "Seven clubs are losing two players, including Manchester City, in Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri, with a further three clubs losing one player, including Liverpool in Mohamed Salah, who has departed having impressed off the bench against Brighton.",
      "Leaders Arsenal are one of six Premier League clubs not losing any players to the tournament.",
      "Losing players is one thing, losing important players is another.",
      "In terms of minutes played by players taking part in AFCON, Sunderland again come out as the worst-hit.",
      "Their six players called up to the tournament have played a combined 4,412 minutes in the Premier League this season. Sadiki and Reinildo account for around half that total, but Chemsdine Talbi and Bertrand Traore have also featured regularly.",
      "Fulham are next on the list in second, narrowly ahead of Manchester United in third, as both teams lose players with just over 3,000 Premier League minutes played.",
      "For the Cottagers, the biggest losses, in terms of minutes played, are Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey, both of whom represent Nigeria. For United, it's Cameroon's Mbeumo and Ivory Coast's Amad.",
      "Everton and West Ham are next in the rankings, with Ndiaye, Idrissa Gueye, Malick Diouf and Aaron Wan-Bissaka all regular starters who have played more than 1,000 Premier League minutes this season.",
      "While Sunderland will have to cope without crucial defensive players, other clubs will have to manage without vital attackers.",
      "Manchester United and Fulham are losing 11 goal involvements respectively with the departures of Mbeumo, Amad, Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze.",
      "Everton are next, losing eight, with six of them having come from Ndiaye, while Salah's involvement means Liverpool are losing seven, with the Egypt international having added his latest goal involvement with his assist off the bench in his last appearance before the tournament against Brighton.",
      "The clubs most impacted by AFCON have of course had time to prepare knowing which of their players would likely feature at the tournament well in advance.",
      "In Manchester United's case, did Monday's meeting with Bournemouth at Old Trafford hint at Amorim's plans?",
      "He is losing two players key to his preferred system in Amad and Mbeumo, who occupy the right wing-back and right-sided No 10 spots respectively in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "But the 4-4 draw with Andoni Iraola's side, during which Amad and Mbeumo made their final appearances before the tournament, saw an unprecedented change of shape from the head coach.",
      "For the first time at United, Amorim switched from a back three to a back four, a significant tactical adjustment which may be a response to losing Amad and Mbeumo for a busy run of fixtures.",
      "How Amorim adapts is just one of many questions as Premier League clubs contend with their AFCON absentees.",
      "Can Sunderland maintain their brilliant start?",
      "Will Salah's prolonged absence help or hinder Liverpool?",
      "And could Arsenal capitalise on having no players involved?",
      "We explain why Bruno Fernandes is this season's biggest Premier League game-changer - and why nobody can match Mohamed Salah over the last 15 years.",

      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans back onside with tactical flexibility against Bournemouth, but AFCON absences raise new problems, writes Dan Khan...",
      "As I go for walks around Manchester I constantly bump into United fans and we always end up chatting about how they feel their club is doing.",
      "After drab, lacklustre performances against Everton and West Ham, one gentleman in my barbers last week - a season ticket holder in the Stretford End - told me he just wants to see United 'go for it' and put on a performance. That's all.",
      "Despite the draw against Bournemouth extending their run of form to just two wins from seven, the overall performance saw most fans leave Old Trafford satisfied with the display they had witnessed.",
      "You can look at the metrics like xG and shot count to explain why United could have had a hatful in the first half, but it was not just that which left their supporters content.",
      "It was Leny Yoro at right-back, looking revitalised on his return to the side, showing aggression and pressing high.",
      "Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw, a centre-back duo I did not think I would ever write, also echoed that aggression with Mason Mount looking even more like the player United signed from Chelsea in July 2023.",
      "This was the difference: the intent from Amorim's team. This is what the home fans responded to and what Amorim had been asking from his players. To show that aggression, win their duels and give the fans at Old Trafford a show and they duly obliged despite the disappointment at sharing the points in the end.",
      "It is impossible to gloss over the ease which some of Bournemouth's goals were scored but perhaps context is required as well to explain United's defensive woes in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim told us after the game he does not believe significant investment is required in defence, and that he has the characteristics among his players to improve and defend better as a team.",
      "It is easy to forget United were without their best defender this season, Matthijs de Ligt, and two other potential starters in Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made another cameo off the bench but looked understandably rusty after returning from a knee injury that kept him out since February.",
      "With the defensive issues highlighted, it is also important to focus on an area which was of utmost urgency to improve from last season: scoring goals.",
      "Last season, United were among the division's lowest scorers and, of course, spent hundreds of millions of pounds to address that through signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But even with that added fire power the new front three have started just three Premier League games together due to untimely injuries to Cunha and Sesko.",
      "All things considered, if had you said at this point United would find themselves sixth, two points off a top four spot and the second-highest scorers in the division, you would have thought not is all bad for a team still working itself out.",
      "Despite positives about what could be going forward, I also cannot help but have a feeling of frustration for Amorim.",
      "Not that he needs empathy after the Bournemouth performance or result, not because he showed he can be flexible in his tactical system when often accused of the opposite, and certainly not because United were the better team but once again failed to see out a lead.",
      "I feel frustration for Amorim because just as we have finally seen his side put on their best attacking and entertaining home performance of his reign, other than maybe against Brighton this season, he now waves off two of his star attacking players, Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, as they depart for AFCON.",
      "Neither we nor Amorim will see a United team with that pace or threat of attack again for at least a month, until both players return.",
      "Amorim will welcome Sesko's return to the matchday squad and he could easily slot into Mbeumo's position alongside Cunha, but he has a huge dilemma on how to balance the right-hand side, which looked so effective against Bournemouth with the pace and combination play of Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "How does he fill that hole? There is no straightforward answer.",
      "The immediate thought is that if Yoro continues at right back, Diogo Dalot may be the most natural to slot in ahead of him as a makeshift winger with Patrick Dorgu on the left of defence - but United have often looked blunt in attack when both have started this season.",
      "Potential solutions may present themselves, perhaps. Kobbie Mainoo could get more game time if Bruno Fernandes is shifted upfield, or he could perhaps even find himself on the right of a narrow diamond in midfield.",
      "Mainoo has yet to start a league game this season but did enjoy a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth and could be in line to replace the suspended Casemiro against Aston Villa.",
      "The Brazilian's absence adds another headache, robbing Amorim of his midfield enforcer against such an in-form Villa side. There will also be a focus from fans about Amorim utilising Academy products.",
      "The likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher will more than likely find themselves on the bench in the coming weeks but is Amorim comfortable enough to turn to them? So far, the answer has been no.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11 but Bruno Fernandes has made the biggest contribution to his team this season",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 15:56, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes showed his importance to Manchester United yet again as he produced a goal and assist during a man-of-the-match performance in their 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "In an interview published after the game, he then accused the club's hierarchy of trying to cash in on him during the summer, saying the episode had left him \"hurt\" and \"sad\".",
      "But just how vital is he to Man Utd? And where does he rank among the Premier League's biggest game-changers?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically - and Fernandes and Mohamed Salah, another player under the microscope lately, feature prominently.",
      "Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough campaign for Manchester United.",
      "His four goals and six assists have won Ruben Amorim's side a whopping 14 points.",
      "The Bournemouth game was the latest example, with his goal involvements proving the difference between a loss and a draw. He won Manchester United two and three points respectively in their recent wins over Wolves and Crystal Palace too.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Fernandes has made result-altering goal involvements in eight Premier League games this season.",
      "Morgan Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Erling Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is tied with Haaland on 10 points won after his goal helped Bournemouth grab a point at Old Trafford on Monday, with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike next on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 26 points after 16 games.",
      "Semenyo is second, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "So, Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed recent dip in form.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool following his short spell at Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "But nobody can match that of Fernandes this season.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",
