      "Emiliano Martinez has been tipped to join Manchester United this summer, amid rumours he could leave Aston Villa. Martinez has starred for Villa since joining the club from Arsenal in 2020 and is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world.",
      "Arsenal are said to be interested in bringing Martinez back to the Emirates, while clubs in the Saudi Pro League have reportedly made highly lucrative approaches for the 32-year-old shot stopper.",
      "However, Martinez's former coach Neil Cutler believes a move to Old Trafford would appeal to the World Cup winner. Cutler worked with Martinez at Villa before leaving the club in 2022, with the goalkeeper branding him the \"best English coach by miles\" after his departure.",
      "The pair remain close friends and when asked about Martinez's future, Cutler told the Sun : \"This summer is pivotal for Emi in terms of his career. He's been voted the best goalie in the world twice and there seems to be an opportunity for him this summer, with all of his options open.",
      "\"Big clubs are queuing up to speak to him and he either stays at a massive club like Villa or he goes to a truly world-class club. I don't think it's about money with Emi so I don't think he is ready to move to Saudi yet.",
      "\"If he does move it would be to a much bigger club — one of the really big-hitters like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico... or even Manchester United. United can't offer him Champions League football but the sheer size of the club and the size of the challenge might appeal to Emi.",
      "\"Emi has the confidence required to play for a massive club like United and would feel he could affect the club in a really positive way. He would look at United and say: 'Right, I can make this place better. I can help this club get back to where it was'.\"",
      "Martinez was left in tears after Villa's final home game of the season, further fuelling speculation that he could be set to leave the club this summer.",
      "And when asked about the futures of Martinez and Leon Bailey after the game, Villa boss Unai Emery said: \"Now we are focused on the matches we are playing. It is the last match here. I don't know.",
      "\"We will see. We will see about the team, the players. They are responding and are so focused on how we are preparing each match. We have more points to play for against Manchester United. We will see how we can get better for the next season.\"",
      "Emery was then asked outright after Villa's defeat to United on the final day of the season if Martinez had played his final game for the club and he replied: \"No way.\"",

      "Matteo Darmian endured a tough time at Manchester United, though his plummeting transfer value hasn't stopped him from becoming a Champions League finalist with Inter Milan. The Italian right-back was poached from Torino in 2015 for a respectable £12.7million, and he started his United career with an impressive 1-0 Premier League win against Tottenham under Louis van Gaal.",
      "He was named the club's Player of the Month for that August. In the years to come, Darmian would prove himself as a dependable squad player, aiding in FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League victories under different managers.",
      "Although he was never quite the first name on the team sheet, he carved out a respectable top-flight career as a versatile, solid option at full-back.",
      "Darmian left Old Trafford in 2019, heading back to his homeland and Serie A with Parma. A year later, after some solid outings, he joined Inter on loan, before signing permanently at the end of that season.",
      "Since then, Darmian has proven to be an underrated piece of Inter's continuous hunt for silverware, winning a pair of Scudettos, three Italian Super Cups and two Coppa Italia trophies.",
      "Now he has the opportunity to add the Champions League to that roll of honours when Inter take on PSG on Saturday night. But he'll line up for the match with his value vastly reduced from his time with the Red Devils.",
      "Upon signing for United, Darmian was valued at £12.5m, which was similar to the fee United paid for him, according to Transfermarkt. This depreciated over time as the defender got older and failed to leave too much of a mark at Old Trafford. As a result, in 2018, he was valued at £10m.",
      "When Darmian moved to Parma at the age of 30 in 2020, his value stood at £7m. Just before his move to Inter, aged 31, this plummeted to around £3m. This sum is where the Champions League finalist's value remains at the age of 35.",
      "However, Darmian will not be the only ex-United star who is part of Inter's showpiece-reaching squad, as the Henrikh Mkhitaryan will also be present in Munich.",
      "The Red Devils purchased the Armenian in 2016 for £26m from German side Borussia Dortmund, though his estimated value at the time was £31m.",
      "Mkhitaryan's form at Old Trafford was sketchy, but he featured regularly under Jose Mourinho before moving to Arsenal as part of the deal that saw Alexis Sanchez go in the opposite direction.",
      "Upon joining the Gunners, he was valued at £29m, though this dropped to £21m the following year before he sealed a transfer to Roma. There, his value would decrease again, despite the fact he won the Conference League.",
      "By 2022, when he moved to Inter, he was valued at just £7m. As of this year, at the age of 36, the Armenian has a valuation of just £3.3m. Nevertheless, he has compiled a brilliant collection of silverware over an impressive career, winning a Scudetto, the Carabao Cup and the Europa League, among other honours.",

      "Gary Lineker has sounded a note of caution to Manchester United regarding their pursuit of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. United endured a miserable campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "That defeat meant the club missed out on a possible Champions League spot and will not be able to offer European football next season.",
      "Despite the hefty blow that failure will have on the club's transfer budget, United head coach Ruben Amorim is still looking to bolster his squad, with Cunha emerging as a key target.",
      "Reports suggest United are prepared to activate his £62.5million buy-out clause to bring the attacker to Old Trafford. However, Lineker has signalled that Cunha might suffer from \"lacking team principles and work ethic\".",
      "\"He's an incredibly talented player. There's a slight question mark against Matheus Cunha in terms of managers,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"He's either brilliant or he can be accused occasionally of lacking team principles and work ethic.",
      "\"I think a couple of the managers at Wolves have alluded to that. Perhaps, I don't know him personally, but perhaps he can be slightly problematic.\"",
      "The 26-year-old was handed a two-game ban in December after appearing to elbow an Ipswich Town staff member before removing the same person’s glasses. In March, he was also suspended for four games after headbutting Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez and being escorted down the tunnel during an FA Cup clash.",
      "However, Micah Richards thinks a move to United could be just what Cunha needs to put past troubles behind him. The ex-Manchester City centre-back believes that a change of scenery to a bigger club could help Cunha thrive.",
      "\"I think that 's more out of frustration,\" Richards said in response to Lineker's comments. \"I think if you're playing with–where Man United finished this season, you can't even say a better team–but ultimately a bigger club and better players, ego is put to the side a little bit.",
      "\"I think he's perfect for that system with two number 10s. He loves drifting to one side, getting on the ball, really creative and he can see a pass, so I think he'll be a good signing for Man United if they can get him.\"",
      "With Amorim downplaying the need for extensive squad renovations, it's yet unclear who else will join Cunha at the Red Devils, should he make the move.",
      "\"Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way,\" Amorim said during United's post-season tour. \"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules.",
      "\"We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that. It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\""

      "Lee Roche once started a Champions League game for Manchester United – but he found himself out of football completely less than a decade later. The former defender came through the Red Devils academy during the reign of Sir Alex Ferguson, and while he never established himself in the first team, he did make a handful of appearances for his boyhood club.",
      "Starting against Arsenal in the League Cup was certainly a highlight for Bolton-born Roche, whose shining light in his short United career came when he started against Deportivo La Coruna in the Champions League in March 2003.",
      "Given United had already secured their passage into the knockout stages, Roche was one of many youngsters that Ferguson opted to start in Spain alongside senior stars such as Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Laurent Blanc.",
      "He lasted 45 minutes and was subbed off at half time with United 1-0 down, before they conceded another after the break to lose 2-0 in their final game of the second group stage.",
      "Despite his presence on the European stage, it wasn't long before Roche fell down the footballing pyramid. He had stints with Burnley, Wrexham and Droylsden after being released on a free transfer by United in the summer of 2003, before retiring from the sport at 27 years of age.",
      "Now working on a building site in his post-football career, the 44-year-old admitted he didn't expect his sporting career to end the way it did, especially given the success United possess in their academy graduates.",
      "Asked if he ever expected to have such a drastic career change, he told LFETV back in 2012: \"Definitely not. Especially when you sign for a club as big as Manchester United. You think you're going to be playing football until you're 35.",
      "\"The way things have turned out I've had to work, I've been working here for nearly three years and it's a bit of a change from playing football, but you just have to get on with it.\"",
      "After parting ways with football, Roche was supported by the PFA and has since become a qualified plumber and owns a cavity wall insulation business.",
      "Having had to discover what his next step in life would be after football, Roche said he believes young players should have a back-up plan if their careers don't blossom as they'd expect.",
      "\"I have had a few fellow workers on the building sites asking me about United and how have I ended up here,\" he said.",
      "\"It can get pretty tiresome so I don’t go shouting about that I played for United. I do think young players today should be made to train as something, so they know about the real world. Most of them probably don’t have a plan to fall back on if they don’t make it as a professional.\""

      "Since coach Ruben Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, the hunt for competent wing-backs to suit his system has been lingering. The likes of Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw, and Noussair Mazraoui simply haven't cut it, and Patrick Dorgu, who was recruited in January, has failed to make a splash.",
      "Back in the summer of 2024, it was reported that Dutch defender Dumfries would refuse to pen a new deal with Inter until after the window had closed, and even when it did, no negotiations were entered. This put United on high alert, as, according to The Athletic, Dumfries was focused on moving elsewhere, and the Red Devils appealed the most.",
      "With Amorim joining and placing a further emphasis on wide play, the prospect of a player of Dumfries' calibre being poached this summer, with his contract winding down, would have been joyous for United, though these hopes have now been dashed.",
      "The 29-year-old, who has played a pivotal role in guiding last year's Scudetto winners to the Champions League final, where they'll face Paris Saint-Germain, has reversed his wish to depart and signed a new deal in Italy until 2028.",
      "Amorim's side are now left in an all-too-familiar predicament, with the right-sided wing-back position one they are in dire need of improving. One player who was linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer was Dumfries' fellow countryman, Bundesliga star Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "The pacey 24-year-old was a key part of Bayer Leverkusen's brilliant unbeaten league campaign last year, and with his contract nearing its end, suitors were queuing up.",
      "Yet, though his expertise up and down the right-hand side would have suited Amorim's United to a tee, and they were reportedly actively pursuing a deal for the player, according to German outlet BILD, rivals Liverpool will imminently secure his services for roughly £30million.",
      "With both Dumfries and Frimpong lost out on, attention will likely turn elsewhere, with a gaping hole still occupying this area of the pitch.",
      "Amorim has made it clear in the past exactly what he wants from his right-sided star, stating after a home win against Everton last December: \"What I want is a good one-against-one, to open the field, to play, to close the field when we lose the ball, and it is the same in every team.\"",
      "Stephen Warnock, a full-back who starred for Liverpool and Aston Villa, among others, detailed exactly what traits a competent wing-back will need to thrive in the Premier Legaue, telling The Athletic: \"You've got to be able to get up and down the pitch.",
      "\"You also need replacements to come on and be able to play in those areas,\" he continued, suggesting that just one signing within these areas may not be enough for United.",
      "\"If you are going to be up and down in that position, then you've got to be able to run yourself into the ground for, say, 70 to 80 minutes, and then maybe at the end of the game, you need someone to come on and just fill in that gap.\"",

      "It was reported that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko favoured a move to Arsenal last year, but the Gunners may need to part with an eye-watering sum to secure his services now. Mikel Arteta's side endured a tumultuous 2024/25 season, which once again ended without silverware or a major final.",
      "They were forced to settle for second place in the Premier League for the third year in a row, and a Champions League run ended in disappointment at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the semis. One notable statistic that arose from a season filled with injury was that, for the first time in 1924, no Arsenal player reached the 10 league goals tally.",
      "Amid reports linking Sesko to the Premier League 12 months ago, it was revealed that, out of Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United, he would rather end up with the Gunners. This revelation was followed in January by the claim that a £60million gentleman's agreement had been reached between the player and his German employers, meaning he would be able to leave this summer for that amount.",
      "A substantial January offer was rumoured to have been enough for Leipzig to part ways with Sesko then, and while Barcelona's eye was caught alongside the interested Gunners, such an offer never arrived.",
      "Fast-forward to the here and now and new reports suggest that £60m would not be enough for suitors Arsenal to secure Sesko's services. Instead, the Telegraph now reports that a price tag of £92m has been slapped on the marksman.",
      "Sesko mustered 21 goals in 45 matches for Leipzig during the campaign gone by, though with his club missing out on European football, it is likely that finances will need to be raised.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly been discussing internally whether to push ahead and attempt to strike a deal with Leipzig, with Chelsea also interested, or aim efforts at signing Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres. When asked in April about what may happen this summer, Sesko replied: \"We'll see what happens. It's open, anything can happen.\"",
      "Arteta, too, has stayed coy on Arsenal's plans for this upcoming window, but did hint that while an initial budget and plan have been put in place, the option to break the bank under sporting director Andrea Berta is there.",
      "\"The thing is that the budget is like when you have your wedding, you plan your wedding with your wife and you give her a budget and never less, it's always more,\" admitted Arteta.",
      "\"When you build a house, it's always more. Normally, this happens. You prepare for different scenarios. Then, unfortunate things happen. Sometimes we want a player, and suddenly we have an injury, or that player gets injured.",
      "\"There are so many variables that can happen, but there is a budget. There is always an idea of what we can do, what we can improve, what the priorities are going to be, and then let's see if we can do it.\"",
      "It remains to be seen where Arsenal's attacking attention will primarily turn, but with the window briefly opening from Sunday until June 10 due to the Club World Cup, Berta and Co may be wise to move quick and finally resolve Arteta's glaring issue once and for all.",

The Inter Milan forward is gearing up for the Champions League final on Saturday, where the Italian giants take on Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "A win for the Nerazzurri would see Arnautovic capture his second UCL medal with the Serie A side, having been part of their last triumph in the competition in the 2009/10 season.",
      "The Austria international played just three times during his first stint with Inter but made a name for himself during his four-year spell with Stoke City.",
      "His performances led him to a move to West Ham, where he hit double digits in goals in both seasons he spent in London before earning a big-money transfer to Chinese side Shanghai Port.",
      "A return to Italy beckoned in 2021 with Bologna as Arnautovic, who was 33 at the time, enjoyed a career-best season with 14 goals in 33 games before following that up with 10 goals in 22 games in his second campaign.",
      "With that came summer interest from United, who had just appointed Erik ten Hag. Reports of the forward potentially arriving at Old Trafford weren't well received by sections of fans, with the club then reportedly pulling out due to the feedback they received despite tabling a bid worth £7.6 million.",
      "However, Arnautovic's agent set the record straight and claimed that it was his player who turned down a move to United, with the forward himself backing up the story in 2022. \"Manchester United tried to sign me several times,\" Arnautovic told Laola1. \"And it was a difficult decision to stay in Italy because my family wanted to return to England.",
      "\"For me, it’s clear that the Red Devils remain at the top of the universe. And Bologna, as a name, are not. But that’s fine. Here everything is calm, you have time for yourself and no stress. This is only good for me.\"",
      "The interest in signing the forward was due to the possible departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was said to have wanted to depart Old Trafford after failing to qualify for the Champions League.",

Fast-forward two years, and the 40-year-old's time in the Middle East looks to be coming to an end after a social media post sparked doubts over his future.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been given SEVEN DAYS to decide to leave Manchester United. The club captain is wanted by Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal in a monster £100million transfer, that would also see the Portuguese earn himself £100m tax-free - a whopping £700k-a-week - over the next three years.",
      "Al Hilal will play in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, and Saudi chiefs are desperate to see their marquee club make a splash, well aware that the eyes of the world will be on them when they face Real Madrid in their tournament opener on June 18.",
      "And they are desperate to land 30-year-old Fernandes, in a move that would see him link up with Portugal team-mates Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo, ex-Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly, former Fulham hitman Aleksandar Mitrovic, and, potentially, Cristiano Ronaldo - if a deal can be fixed to allow him to join on a temporary deal.",
      "Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, spent three days in Saudi at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh this week, as he held negotiations with club Al Hilal representatives. And there is growing belief that Fernandes could be persuaded to make the move.",
      "Publicly, United insist their best player is not for sale. However, the £100m transfer fee is a transformational sum given their financial predicament, with those pressures having only grown after last week's Europa League Final loss to Spurs, a defeat which ultimately cost them £100m in Champions League revenue next term.",
      "Publicly, United insist their best player is not for sale. However, the £100m transfer fee is a transformational sum given their financial predicament and it's not beyond the realm of possibility that Fernandes is asked to leave for the good of the club.",
      "But boss Ruben Amorim is desperate for him to STAY - and told Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers to make up the money elsewhere.",
      "Speaking after United ended their post-season tour of Asia with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong, which Fernandes played the opening 45 minutes of, Amorim was asked if fans had seen the last of their captain in action.",
      "\"I don't think so, I don't know for sure. Nobody knows but I don't think so,\" the Red Devils boss said. \"I think he is seeing us taking some actions to change all the things and I think he saw that and I think he wants to stay.",
      "\"He is saying no to a lot of things but he shows he wants to win. He's really young, he's really good he needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "Amorim was then asked if United, who've failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in 11 years, were in a position to turn down the kind of money which Al-Hilal would be willing to pay for Fernandes.",
      "\"Yes, we can find another way to earn money,\" he replied. \"Of course I'm the manager, I'm the coach but sometimes it's the decision of the player. But of course I talk with him, I explain things. I just have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated but he knows what we are doing.",
      "\"The feeling is every time I speak with him he wants to continue at Manchester United but you never know.\"",
      "Fernandes won the club’s player of the year award for a record-equalling fourth time having been a shining light during the Red Devils’ worst top-flight campaign since suffering relegation in 1973-74.",
      "But former United star Paul Scholes believes club chiefs should \"bite Al Hilal's hand off\" and take the money for the Old Trafford talisman.",
      "The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate : “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong.",
      "\"But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”"

      "The dust is only just beginning to settle on the 2024/25 campaign - but we’re already firmly into transfer season. A number of Premier League clubs are getting their business done early.",
      "Bids have already been lodged, while some contracts have already been signed. And that is only sure to ramp up over the coming days as the window opens.",
      "Due to this summer’s Club World Cup, there will be two separate windows. The first opens on June 1 and runs until June 10.",
      "Arsenal - Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad)",
      "Admirers of the Spanish midfielder for some time, Arsenal have bitten the bullet and decided to pay his £51m release clause. Reports in Spain suggest that he is preparing to complete an Arsenal medical soon so a deal might be done very shortly.",
      "Aston Villa - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)",
      "The Man United academy graduate had managed to recover his form before an injury cruelly cut short his time with Aston Villa. The Midlands side have a £40m option to buy him permanently which they could activate but whether they do that without a guaranteed Champions League payday remains to be seen.",
      "Bournemouth - Kyogo Furuhashi (Rennes)",
      "The Cherries have already conducted some business this summer with defender Dean Huijsen on his way to Real Madrid. Reports have suggested that ex-Celtic man Kyogo Furuhashi could be targeted and given the rotten time of things he has had in France, it could be a relatively straightforward move.",
      "Brentford - Caoimhin Kelleher (Liverpool)",
      "Kelleher has regularly expressed his desire to leave Liverpool for more regular first team football. Brentford could offer him just that. The Bees have been in touch with their Premier League rivals over recent days regarding a deal.",
      "Brighton - Diego Coppola (Hellas Verona)",
      "A talented young defender, the Italian has made a name for himself with Hellas Verona in Serie A. As it stands, the Seagulls are the favourites but could face competition from Juventus and Aston Villa.",
      "Burnley - Daniel Peretz (Bayern Munich)",
      "This very much depends on what happens with James Trafford. But reports in Germany have claimed that the Clarets are keen on sealing Peretz on a loan deal. Bayern would reportedly be willing to loan him out so a deal could be relatively easy.",
      "Chelsea - Liam Delap (Ipswich)",
      "A relatively straightforward one, Chelsea have already activated the £30m release clause written into Delap’s Ipswich contract. It won't be two days, as his medical is happening on Monday, but it should be smooth sailing from there.",
      "Crystal Palace - Reinildo Mandava (Atletico Madrid)",
      "After winning the FA Cup, Palace are understandably keen to bolster their squad. Atletico Madrid left-back Reinildo has reportedly been identified as a replacement for Ben Chilwell, who will return to Chelsea at the end of his loan spell.",
      "Everton - Charly Alcaraz (Flamengo)",
      "Much like Rashford, Charly Alcaraz could see his loan move to Everton turned into a permanent one very shortly. The former Southampton man is now in talks over personal terms and is fully expected to become a full-time Toffee.",
      "Fulham - Ardon Jashari (Club Brugge)",
      "This one might actually be a bit more difficult than some of the other names on the list. The Club Brugge midfielder has shone over in Belgium, garnering interest from the Premier League. Fulham could steal a march with an early move.",
      "Leeds United - Manor Solomon (Tottenham)",
      "One of the heroes of Leeds' promotion, there have been calls for the club to push through a permanent deal. And it appears that it could actually happen, with Spurs open to selling. Leeds might face competition from Everton so they might need to get their skates on.",
      "Liverpool - Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is done and his Bayer Leverkusen team-mate may not be far behind. Liverpool have made a second offer to the Germans worth a cool £109m and with Wirtz heading on international duty shortly, his desire to move to Anfield and Leverkusen's delight it's not Bayern, this could move very, very quickly.",
      "Manchester City - Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan)",
      "The champions certainly need some signings to reclaim their crown. And it appears to be in midfield where Pep Guardiola is keen to add some new faces. AC Milan have already rejected City’s opening offer for Reijnders but don’t be surprised if they try again.",
      "Manchester United - Matheus Cunha (Wolves)",
      "Another release clause, another imminent move. Matheus Cunha appears set to become a Red Devil after his £62m release clause was activated. The Brazilian is also set for a medical over the coming days.",
      "Newcastle - Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)",
      "Newcastle are long-term admirers of Guehi and have seen a number of bids rebuffed in the past. But with some financial muscle behind them courtesy of their Champions League qualification, this summer might finally be the window where they get him.",
      "Nottingham Forest - Igor Jesus (Botafogo)",
      "Speaking of European football, Nottingham Forest could do with some depth ahead of their return to continental competition - particularly up front. Botafogo striker Igor Jesus has reportedly emerged as a target with the two clubs seemingly not far away from a deal.",
      "Sunderland - Jordan Henderson (Ajax)",
      "There's been rumours of an emotional return this summer and it could finally be the perfect time for it to happen. Henderson has really struggled to settle since leaving Liverpool and his boyhood club might be the perfect place to do that.",
      "Tottenham - Mathys Tel (Bayern Munich)",
      "Having scored just three times for Spurs since his arrival on loan from Bayern Munich, there is a debate to be had over whether they should activate their option to sign Tel permanently. A deal would be costly at the £50m mark but it would be a relatively easy one to rubber-stamp.",
      "West Ham - Daniel Cummings (Celtic)",
      "West Ham certainly need some additions after their disappointing campaign. Young Celtic star Daniel Cummings will join West Ham this summer at the end of his contract and the move could be announced imminently.",
      "Wolves - Kieran Morrison (Liverpool)",
      "With Cunha on the move, Wolves need to add bodies in attack. But it appears that their concentration is elsewhere for now. Reports have suggested that the Black Country side have made an approach for young Liverpool midfielder Kieran Morrison.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Sav predicted: 16th",
      "They will do well to keep arguably the best front three outside the top six - Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Kevin Schade - together.",

      "Worst Premier League season in their history, no trophies, terrible performance in the Europa League final.",
      "One of the biggest budgets in Europe but won only 11 of 38 league games. Nobody could have dreamed it would be as bad as this. Ruben Amorim needs a total rebuild.",
      "Sav predicted: 3rd",
      "Before Vitor Pereira came in, they were in big trouble and shipping goals for fun. But he strung together six wins in a row and won the hearts of fans by celebrating with them in the pub. Matheus Cunha is off to United, so that’s a big piece of the jigsaw to replace.",

      "Absolutely dreadful in the league, where they lost 22 games, but Ange Postecoglou won Spurs’ first trophy in 17 years - even if it was in a competition where they were among the favourites from the outset. If his remit was Champions League football, he’s delivered.",
      "Sav predicted: 6th",
      "I thought they would go down, so it’s no surprise they are back in the Championship. But sacking Steve Cooper made little sense and to go five months without even scoring a goal or winning a single point at home was diabolical.",
      "Sav predicted: 18th",
      "Again, no surprise that they went down - but the Tractor Boys were one of the biggest spenders in Europe last summer (£120 million) and I expected them to put up more of a fight than just six points from the last available 54.",
      "Sav predicted: 19th",
      "Sorry, but Saints were pathetic. If they hadn’t beaten Derby’s record low of 11 points I would have given them a big fat zero marks, but they managed to beat the Rams’ low-water mark in 2008 by a single point.",

      "Manchester United needed to come from behind in Hong Kong on Friday as they brought their miserable season to a close in what could end up being Bruno Fernandes' last game for the club. There was at least one bright spark, though, with Chido Obi's double turning a half-time deficit into victory.",
      "After a shock defeat in midweek against the ASEAN All Stars, Ruben Amorim wanted a response. There were some promising early moments, but it was Hong Kong who struck first as Juninho's effort beat Tom Heaton all too easily.",
      "It remained 1-0 at the break, and United boss Ruben Amorim changed his entire XI at the break. The changes bore fruit within a few minutes, with Obi equalising impressively, and fellow sub Ayden Heaven had a chance to make it 2-1.",
      "There was still some danger on the break, though, with sub keeper Altay Bayindir needing to be alert to deny Lau Ka Kiu midway through the second period. As the match entered the final 20 minutes, though, United kicked on and Kobbie Mainoo got an opening but couldn't keep his shot down.",
      "United also saw a penalty appeal waved away when Mason Mount went down in the box. It was Obi who settled the tie, though, sending a glancing header into the far corner, and Heaven's stoppage-time header made it three.",
      "United looked full of energy in the opening minutes, with Rasmus Hojlund getting a sight of goal early on, but the striker was unable to beat Hong Kong keeper Ka Wing Tse. United had the ball in the net not long after, with Casemiro sending a diving header into the nt, but the flag went up for offside.",
      "Tse made a couple more sharp saves insde the first half hour to keep Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho at bay. The pair were among the senior stars handed starts by Ruben Amorim, while youngsters including Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got minutes from the get-go",
      "Before the game, much of the conversation surrounded Bruno Fernandes. He was reported to be open to a United exit. Al Hilal appear to be the most likely suitors, with a £100million transfer fee mooted as well as a £200m contract.",
      "United are said to be relaxed about the situation, and there was no danger of their skipper sitting this one out. His usual creativity was on show early on, but Casemiro hasd strayed just offside before heading home the captain's free-kick.",
      "He came close to breaking the deadlock with another free-kick, with the ball moving wildly and almost deceiving Tse. There was an even bigger chance 10 minutes before half-time, but he opted to attempt a rabona when one-on-one with the keeper and saw it blocked, and only time will tell whether that ends up being Fernandes' final game for the club",
      "It was another scoreless game for Rasmus Hojlund, despite his early sight of goal. A second chance arrived late in the first half, only for the Dane to allow an opposition defender to snuff out the chance, and his recent record still stands at just one goal in the last month.",
      "Chido Obi found things far easier after taking his place, though. The young striker replaced Hojlund for the second half and wasted little time finding the net.",
      "His goal was an impressive one, too, with the teenager spinning and firing confidently into the bottom corner. He had more chances before his late winner, and the movement was something Hojlund lacked during his 45 minutes.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho si another who could be on his way, and perhaps he saw this game as a chance to show his quality and willing to potential buyers. He delivered a jinking run and early shot to test Hong Kong's keeper early on, and another run saw him set up a great chance which Shea Lacey sent wide of the far post.",
      "In recent weeks, Garnacho's exit has looked like a matter of when and not if. The same thing appeared to be true in January as well, though, and he ended up sticking around.",
      "Amorim may well have already decided Garnacho is among those players who needs to be sold to raise transfer funds. At his best, though, he can certainly be a difference-maker - it just so happens that he may end up taking on that role for someone else next season.",
      "Heavy rain in Hong Kong ahead of the game made the pitch slow at times, and United paid the penalty. Most notably, Garnacho looked poised to connect with an inviting early cross from Jaydan Kamason, only for the ball to hold up on the turf and allow an opposition defender to clear up.",
      "It was harder to determine whether the slippery conditions might have had something to do with the opener. Either way, the veteran will feel as though he was beaten too easily by the first shot to come his way.",
      "A bigger challenge in difficult conditions can be the risk of injury. Thankfully for United, there was no sign of any setback on that front.",
      "Ahead of the game, Ruben Amorim spoke about his decision to continue blooding first-teamers during the tour. \"Yes because we need to respect and do better than the last game,\" he said.",
      "\"We understand the players are tired from all the commercial things for our fans. Now it's time to perform to show good things for our fans.\"",
      "It has been, by every conceivable measure, a season to forget for United. It's now over, though, and they can finally look towards the future.",

      "Paul Scholes has urged Manchester United to cash in on Bruno Fernandes this summer because the £100million sum offered for him is too good to turn down. The Red Devils legend also believes Fernandes can be detrimental to Ruben Amorim’s tactics because he “confuses the system”.",
      "The Portugal international, 30, has become a top priority of Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window. Al-Hilal are understood to have held lengthy talks with Fernandes’ representatives over a lucrative contract this week, with those discussions improving their chances of signing the United captain.",
      "Fernandes, who joined the Red Devils in January 2020, led the side to their worst-ever Premier League finish this term. And it is believed he is seriously considering quitting United next week as Al-Hilal look to sign the playmaker in time to field him at the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "Fernandes himself has failed to provide any assurances about his future, while his post-match interview comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham last week sparked concerns that he was ready to leave.",
      "Old Trafford bosses, however, are reportedly relaxed about the situation and are willing to listen to offers for any member of their squad, including Fernandes. Having missed out on a significant windfall by failing to qualify for the Champions League, INEOS understand that they will need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while complying with strict Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Equally relaxed about Fernandes' potential departure is club legend Scholes. The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate: “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "Pundit Jamie Carragher agreed, saying: “I’ve always described Bruno Fernandes as a great talent but not a great player. Where does he play?",
      "“He’s a bit mad in that he just runs all over the place, like a kid in the school yard. The best player in the school yard doing everything but in a really poor team. I don’t think he’s ever had any discipline in those No. 10 positions.”",
      "The four-time United Player of the Season's manager, Amorim, however, has made it clear he wants Fernandes to stay. The Portuguese head coach sang the midfielder’s praises during the club’s post-season trip to Asia this week.",
      "Asked about the present situation, Amorim said: \"We’ve talked about this many times. You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership.",
      "“You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",

The Portuguese admitted that Bruno Fernandes started against Hong Kong because his team had to improve following a defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The fixtures are set to land United around £8million in additional funds as the club, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, continues its attempts to find their way to more comfortable financial footing.

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering leaving the club after previously calling for the hierarchy to buck up their ideas in the transfer market. The Portuguese star put pen to paper on a new deal with the Red Devils in August of last year.",
      "However, the extension only materialised after Fernandes made it clear to United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he demanded the club recruit top-class players in order to compete with the very best.",
      "Yet United's current pull in the market is now under threat, meaning the midfielder is believed to be weighing up the decision to move on, with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal said to be circling him.",
      "United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur and their subsequent inability to offer European football next season means luring some of the game's biggest stars to Old Trafford may prove difficult. Mounting financial concerns will also provide a hurdle for Ruben Amorim this summer.",
      "Speaking to the club's website upon signing his contract extension, Fernandes said: \"The club knew that I want to compete with the best teams. They knew that we needed to improve the team. And I think that we’re doing that.",
      "\"I said to the, ‘I don’t need you to promise me that we’re going to win the league, because no one can promise that. But at least that we will have a team to compete and be competitive throughout the season, to try to achieve silverware and to compete at the highest levels.'\"",
      "Under former manager Erik ten Hag, United did hold their end of the deal last summer. Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte and Noussair Mazraoui were brought in for a combined fee believed to be in the region of £200million.",
      "However, Amorim has long been aware funds will likely be tight this summer. In a move that could signal some ambition to Fernandes, it's understood that United are looking to wrap up a £62.5m deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Regardless, Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, is already believed to have held discussions with Al-Hilal about a stunning £100m transfer. United have also refused to rule out his possible sale after insisting that every member of their underperforming squad is up for sale.",
      "Al-Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month. After United's Europa League final defeat, Fernandes cast doubt on his future by suggesting the club could \"cash in\" on him.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting CP in January 2020 for a fee rising to £67.7million. He was United's top scorer in 2024/25 with 19 goals and he retained the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award - an accolade he has won in four out of his six seasons at the club.",
      "United's head coach also underlined the player's significance this week. \"[Fernandes] is really important for us and what we want to build for the team. We talk about this many times,\" Amorim said.",

      "Florian Wirtz has been told Arne Slot is a better manager than Erik ten Hag as the Liverpool boss was revealed to have played a major role in the German's potential move to Anfield. The future of the Bayer Leverkusen star was already set to be a major talking point this summer with the Premier League champions, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City all in the hunt for the 22-year-old.",
      "Conversations surrounding Wirtz's next move indicated that a transfer to the German champions was most likely until he conducted a meeting with Slot, alongside his father and agent, Hans-Joachim Wirtz.",
      "The intervention from the Reds boss was said to have proved critical in the attacking midfielder deciding to snub Bayern in order to move abroad for the first time in his career.",
      "According to Bild, the meeting on May 13 saw Slot provide Wirtz with a clear picture of where he'll fit within his title-winning team and was promised of a starring role in the side's attack.",
      "Becoming enamoured with promises of a central role within one of the world's best teams, as well as being informed of the fervent support that the club possesses from their fans, resulted in Wirtz's father informing Bayern executives Uli Hoeness and Max Eberl that it was Liverpool who had won the race for his son's signature.",
      "Wirtz could have ended up playing for Ten Hag next season, had he chosen to remain with Leverkusen, after the former Manchester United boss was announced as their new manager following the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid.",
      "However, a move to Liverpool will see the Wirtz team up with the better manager, according to Mark Diemers. The Cambuur midfielder enjoyed spells playing under both managers, having spent a brief period alongside the ex-United boss at Utrecht before joining Slot during his time at Feyenoord.",
      "Best positioned to give an opinion on the managerial abilities of both men, the 31-year-old had a clear opinion when admitting who he enjoyed working with more. \"I choose Arne Slot,\" he told ESPN Netherlands last year when asked about the best manager he has worked with.",
      "\"I can only talk from my time. I found Ten Hag insanely good tactically, so were his training sessions. I just didn’t think he was very good, at that time, on a human level. But that was already six or seven years ago. I thought Slot was a lot stronger on a human level.",
      "\"Look at what kind of clubs [Ten Hag] has worked at, so he must also have qualities on a human level. I still have contact with him via WhatsApp. Then he also comes across as very friendly to me. He will undoubtedly have grown on a human level as well.\"",
      "Despite the lack of consistent success in Manchester – and some issues in the dressing room – Ten Hag still managed to win two trophies in his time at the club as he made sure to maintain his status as a manager who is adept in capturing silverware.",
      "Ten Hag also won plaudits for his style of play at Ajax, which encouraged United to initially make a move for the 55-year-old. However, it's Slot who has arguably managed to cement himself as the better of the two in recent times following title successes with Feyenoord and, of course, Liverpool in his first season in as boss of the Premier League club."

      "In 1995, Ince departed Old Trafford and moved to the San Siro, where he shared a dressing room with the likes of Roberto Carlos, Ivan Zamorano, Nicola Berti and many others. It didn't take long for Ince to establish himself in Serie A. He dominated the midfield while wearing the No. 8 shirt of the Nerazzurri, and their iconic fan base took him in as one of their own - quite literally on one occasion.",
      "Like their most extreme supporters, who light up the stands with flares as their drums and megaphones radiate chaos around stadiums in Europe, Ince will be willing Inter on in the Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Italian clubs have their own unique way of showing their love for players, as Ince found out during his time in the capital. Yet, the endearment they paid to him had unfortunate and painful ramifications for one poor ultra.",
      "\"I got sent off against someone, unlike me. I missed a couple of games. We were playing against some team, I think it was Sampdoria or someone like that. I said to my best mate, who played for Inter, 'I’m going to spend a game upstairs with the ultras.'",
      "Watch our full Champions League final interview with Paul Ince and Claude Makelele here",

      "Seeing a man take a huge hook to the nose would normally be anybody's cue to leave the area, but the blue and black lions den that is the Internazionale ultras is no normal place.",
      "Ince continued to follow the head ultra, while other fans in the area cleared a path and maybe avoided looking at the Englishman. While that supporter was left tasting their own blood, the ex-England international was hooked on the adrenaline rush of being with the fanbase - and nearly 30 years later, there's only one thing Ince wants to do.",
      "He added: \"They took me right to the front, right up to the nets and they were singing and chanting, it was the best atmosphere ever. To this day, I want to do it again, I’d love to do it again. I did not get many red cards in the Premier League. But in Italy, it was different. Players were rolling over, feigning injuries.",
      "\"I got sent off about three times, which was very rare for me. I was a strong tackler, but in Italy, I got sent off a lot. I think the fans loved me because of that. The fans were devastated when I left. The fans still love me and still idolise me, so it was great.”",
      "He would go on to leave Inter and return to Liverpool after two seasons, in a move that broke the hearts of the Italian giants and their ultras. Family reasons is what drove Ince back to England. Despite his exit, he is still admired by fans at the club to this day, so it's hard to imagine he'd struggle to secure another invite from the ultras.",

      "In response to that warning, United brought the departure time of their outbound flight forward to Sunday evening, hours after the final game of the season against Aston Villa. That reduced the possibility of any last-minute withdrawals. Injured trio Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Luke Shaw all boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur.",

      "Well-placed sources have said the United players were \"fuming\" to be in Asia after a 60-game season. They are unlikely to generate any sympathy after a trophyless campaign and 15th-placed finish. United did get to lift a cup in Hong Kong, one so undervalued a press officer carried it back to the dressing room.",

Every player conducted the obligatory post-match meet-and-greets in the Hong Kong National Stadium on Friday evening, including a moody Alejandro Garnacho, this time minus his sunglasses.",
      "United's six days away from home Manchester were effectively condensed into four. Tuesday was teeming with commercial player appearances, with some lasting two hours. Players gladhanded guests on behalf of club sponsors Adidas, Tezos and Snapdragon, among others.",
      "Wednesday marked the now infamous Maybank-sponsored open-top bus journey that Zirkzee, De Ligt and Ayden Heaven were on board for. A United source insists it was not arranged with the intention of parading the Europa League trophy around Kuala Lumpur and that it was billed as a bus tour.",
      "In United's view, this was an example of the distinction between engagement with local fans and overseas fans. The bus ride was lapped up by locals. Back home, it was a source of embarrassment for those still reeling from the Bilbao blow.",
      "Adidas hosted a poolside party on the deck of the W Hotel after the defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday evening. Several guests attended the nocturnal gathering and admired the sight of the glistening Petronas Twin Towers in the background.",
      "There was more commercial activity on Friday ahead of the second friendly with a Hong Kong XI. United held more meet-and-greets following their arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, with a minor training session held in the rain. Mason Mount and Altay Bayindir featured after their non-appearances in Malaysia.",
      "Three of their teammates were in India. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium at half-time on Wednesday to board a private jet to Mumbai. Despite intense commercial activities planned, the trio were happy to volunteer as they got to return home earlier.",
      "After United were beaten by the ASEAN All Stars, there was gallows humour on the team bus back to the W Hotel. The booing at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium had not gone unnoticed by players and staff. Ruben Amorim reminded the media in Hong Kong there had been loud cheering, too.",
      "There were some farcical post-match scenes in Kuala Lumpur. United had to collect silver medals for the second Wednesday running, but the procession was delayed. The referee and linesmen had returned to their dressing room but had to be called back out to receive their medals, so United were forced to endure an inordinate wait.",
      "A United player half-joked the post-season tour would be \"like a stag do\". Some players were tempted to venture out beyond the house arrest of the team hotel but were advised by a senior player to stay in.",
      "United staff let their hair down on the trip. Some enjoyed drinks on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur while players had permission to head out into Kuala Lumpur on their first night in the Malaysian capital, flanked by security. A source said nothing \"crazy\" happened.",
      "Sources say the players returned at a reasonable time. United did not bother adjusting to the seven-hour time zone difference as training and commercial obligations were always held in the afternoons and evenings.",
      "Club sources acknowledged the trip was not as disciplined as a pre-season tour and that players could be more frivolous. Garnacho, Amad and Heaven headed out on e-scooters that had to be paid for by clued-up locals. Zirkzee was not taken by the room service on offer at the W Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, so headed across the road for some Thai take-out, again accompanied by a security guard.",
      "On the eighth floor of United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur there was a vending machine that dispensed mini bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne, priced at £40. If any United representative was of that persuasion it would have been to drown their sorrows after a shocking season.",
      "Happy faces were put on for signing sessions yet United players still made headlines with some explicit gestures. Amad raised his middle finger to fans he claimed were abusing his mother. Garnacho has done it multiple times without provocation. The players were advised to stop making the offensive gesture.",
      "Those on the tour have found Garnacho to be surly. He promised the All Stars forward Sergio Aguero that he would give him his shirt after the game. Instead, Garnacho blanked Aguero and United staff had to arrange for a shirt to be gifted to the Malaysian as a memento. It was noticeable in Hong Kong how carefully some of United's staff shadowed Garnacho as he signed shirts and posed for pictures, never breaking into a smile.",
      "Garnacho was one of the last to board the team bus after the All Stars defeat. With midnight looming, he donned sunglasses and ignored requests in the mixed zone. An eyewitness said he removed the shades almost immediately after he walked past the packed pen and surmised they were donned at the behest of personal sponsors. It still projected a brattish attitude.",
      "Beyond some of the imagery that has emerged on social media, Garnacho also stuck his middle finger up at one of the United photographers after the All Stars match. Amorim started to chuckle when the remote possibility of Garnacho staying was raised at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday.",
      "Amorim cheerfully admitted to a colleague how exhausting the post-season tour had been, especially in the humidity of Malaysia. The Portuguese will oversee his first pre-season tour with United in July, a condensed and relatively low-key return to the United States, spent primarily in Chicago.",
      "The prestige of the United manager's role has dawned on him. \"It's more than a coach,\" Amorim admitted. \"On this tour, I had a small meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.",
      "\"You have to improve as a person, as a leader, you have to control the momentum. Sometimes after games you see I'm really frustrated, I'm trying to control that. The only thing I want is to improve the team and have results, when you have results you can manage the team so much easier.\"",
      "It would be easier if Bruno Fernandes stayed but the United captain is giving serious consideration to an approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. Figures at United empathise with Fernandes, who has not shied from the subject with confidants. They would not blame him if he were to up sticks after five-and-a-half years of underachievement with United. Fernandes has not formally told United he wants to leave.",
      "There is understandable concern at the prospect of United minus Fernandes. His leadership has been apparent even over the past few days in Asia, where he bought staff drinks at the hotel bar and was generous with post-match autograph requests from Malaysian fans who had crammed into the mixed zone. It was the same in Hong Kong. Fernandes was ushered to the team coach by three secruity guards.",
      "United's stay in Hong Kong was so whistlestop that they were barely in the country for 36 hours. After an early-morning flight, the team spent around an hour at their second W Hotel to freshen up and have lunch. Then it was back on the bus to the Hong Kong Stadium for training and more meet-and-greets.",
      "With ample time to reflect on their worst season in 51 years, some within the United camp are already at the end of their tether with many in the squad. The widespread consensus is that the players do not play to their maximum in every match, as evidenced by the contrast in their Europa League and Premier League form.",
      "During the open training session in Kuala Lumpur, United's back-to-front attacks were constructed at a glacial pace. One of the inflatable mannequins quickly deflated.",
      "That is how the players would feel if they have to embark on another post-season trek."

      "Manchester United brought their post-season tour to an end with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.",
      "After trailing 1-0 at half-time, United flipped the game on its head in the second half via a brace from Chido Obi and a late header from Ayden Heaven.",
      "It marked a victorious conclusion to a 67-game season that everyone associated with United will be keen to forget about as quickly as possible.",
      "With the tour now wrapped up and the season officially done and dusted, full focus switches to the summer transfer window and the start of next season. But following the conclusion of the tour of Asia, which saw United visit Malaysia before travelling to Hong Kong, MEN Sport has picked out four post-tour talking points:",
      "After being informed by Ruben Amorim prior to last Sunday's Premier League finale against Aston Villa at Old Trafford that he will be free to leave the club this summer, the last thing Alejandro Garnacho would have wanted is to travel to Asia on a post-season tour and participate in two meaningless friendlies.",
      "After starting the 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on the bench, Garnacho was named in the starting XI for the win over Hong Kong. Despite earning cheers from supporters every time he touched the ball and attempting to be inventive when he had possession, his mannerisms off the pitch were not of somebody in a good mood.",
      "United staff shadowed him carefully during a signing session in Hong Kong, during which he never broke into a smile. He also ignored requests to speak to journalists in the mixed zone after the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars, walking straight through, donning dark sunglasses as midnight approached.",
      "The biggest positive of the post-season tour by a country mile was Obi claiming his first goals for United's first-team, netting a smart brace in the win in Hong Kong. For his first goal, he swivelled inside the box and fired a clinical left-footed shot into the back of the net.",
      "His second goal was all about his intelligent movement and reading of the game. Recognising Mason Mount, who also impressed in the second half against Hong Kong, was about to float a ball into the box, the young Dane was quick to make a run across his man and glance a header into the bottom corner.",
      "Obi, in that move alone, produced much better movement inside the box than fellow countryman Rasmus Hojlund did at any point across his two starts on tour. Hojlund's box movement is one of his biggest flaws.",
      "Obi, meanwhile, looked razor-sharp against Hong Kong and his two goals, despite not being competitive strikes, will have done him the world of good. With a full pre-season under his belt, he could get a more prominent role in the squad next season.",
      "The main purpose of United's trip to Asia may have been for commercial reasons, with the six-day trip expected to bank them somewhere between £8million and £10m, but that was never going to create headlines. Instead, transfer talk was always going to do fill column inches.",
      "After Amorim, sitting alongside Mount at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, said United \"cannot do much\" in this summer's window, Omar Berrada, the following day, said United will have to be \"prudent\" in their attempts to strengthen the squad ahead of next season.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now,\" Berrada told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve. So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.\"",
      "With that in mind, United are unlikely to be able to attack the transfer window as much as they would have liked. Instead, as a result of missing out on the improved revenue streams that would have come with securing Champions League qualification, they will have to be that little be wiser and shrewder.",
      "One of the biggest positives United have had to shout about this calendar year have been the performances of January recruit Heaven. Despite only making six competitive appearances before the end of the season and two on the tour, the 18-year-old defender has not put a foot wrong since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He has a solid reading of the game, his positional awareness is spot on and his ability on the ball is excellent. As a left-footer, he could find himself ahead of Lisandro Martinez in the race to start on the left of the back-three come the end of next season.",
      "Although Hong Kong did not provide the sternest test United have ever faced, Heaven, following his half-time introduction, was able to progress the ball really well from deep areas and help his teammates get up the pitch. Those ball-playing credentials in a centre-back and becoming more and more important in the modern game, and United appear to have uncovered a gem."

      "After three prolific seasons on the spin with Napoli, Victor Osimhen continued to do what he does best out on loan at Galatasaray this term, plundering a career-best 36 goals in a single season.",
      "Osimhen, 26, joined Galatasaray on a season-long loan deal last September after falling out with Napoli boss Antonio Conte and he was considered as something of a coup for the Turkish giant.",
      "Of his 36 goals, 25 of them were netted in the Super Lig, earning Galatasaray a whopping 21 points. Without them, Galatasaray would have surrendered their crown to Jose Mourinho and Fenerbahce, who finished 11 points behind in second.",
      "Many will be quick to suggest that the Turkish Super Lig is not the most challenging of leagues in Europe and has been a dumping ground for Premier League talent in recent years.",
      "Osimhen, though, has established himself as a seasoned goalscorer, scoring 84 goals in the last three seasons for Napoli and Galatasaray combined. He scored 26 goals in Serie A in 2022/23 to deliver Napoli their first league title since 1990.",
      "Prior to moving to Italy in 2020, Osimhen enjoyed a respectable first and only season at French side Lille, scoring 18 times to help them secure a top four finish in Ligue 1.",
      "A consistent source of goals for six seasons, Osimhen has established himself as an elite-level striker. Manchester United considered signing him two summers ago and, regrettably, went for Rasmus Hojlund instead.",
      "Osimhen is well above Hojlund's station and his record in front of goal proves that. He is also four years his senior and has won major honours, including two league titles.",
      "After recording a minus goal deficit in each of the last two Premier League campaigns, United cannot afford to take another gamble on potential this summer, hence why moving for Liam Delap always carried a huge element of risk.",
      "In Osimhen, United would be sourcing a proven goalscorer who has delivered the goods at whatever club he has played for. It is a striker of his calibre they need.",
      "The elephant in the room, of course, is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen played in the Europa League for Galatasaray this season, scoring six goals, and had played in the Champions League for two consecutive seasons with Napoli prior to that.",
      "However, the Nigerian, who is entering his prime years, has previously outlined his hunger to play in the Premier League, describing it as a \"dream\" back in 2023 - a time when both United and Chelsea were being heavily linked with him.",
      "\"I think playing in one of the top five leagues in the world (Serie A) is an amazing feeling for me,\" Osimhen said in March 2023.",
      "\"A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but now I'm in one of the best leagues in the world which is the Italian Serie A.",
      "\"I'm working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday but, like I said, it's a process and I just want to keep on this momentum and continue to do well.\"",
      "With no European football to offer next season, United could find it challenging to attract the level of talent head coach Ruben Amorim craves. However, if Osimhen is still as hungry to play in England, he may be willing to give up European football for a season and make it his mission to take United back to the Champions League.",
      "If United are to swoop for him, he would be signed to spearhead their attack, making him a guaranteed starter.",
      "If United sell Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho this summer, the money raised from those sales would be enough to put a package together to try and land Osimhen.",
      "Signing a proven goalscorer is a non-negotiable for United this summer, and Osimhen can deliver the guarantee of goals they so desperately need."

      "A touch to control the ball, a second to get it out of his feet and another to score.",
      "Chido Obi managed to contribute more with just three touches in Manchester United's game against Hong Kong than Rasmus Hojlund mustered in the 45 minutes of the first half.",
      "Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at half-time and Obi replaced Hojlund. Obi is just 17, but he might take Hojlund's role in the first-team squad permanently at this rate.",
      "It's damning for Hojlund that an inexperienced striker, someone who has been described as naive by his own manager, genuinely looks like a bigger goal threat when he comes onto the pitch.",
      "Hojlund looked the same as always against Hong Kong: blunt. He didn't look convincing against the 153rd-ranked national team in the world and took a few heavy touches in the box.",
      "It would be harsh and unfair to heavily scrutinise Hojlund's performance, given these post-season friendlies were arranged at the end of a long campaign, but it certainly wasn't the first time that Obi had replaced him from the bench and looked more capable of finding the back of the net.",
      "Obi was introduced for Hojlund on a few occasions in competitive games this season, and a clear pattern has emerged that suggests the Dane should be doing a lot more up front.",
      "There is no denying that Obi is raw and still has bundles to learn, but his movement in the box is better than Hojlund's and he possesses a knack for goalscoring that his senior peer does not.",
      "Obi's first goal against Hong Kong on Friday afternoon was instinctive, a proper centre-forward strike, and the kind of clinical finish that someone like Gary Lineker built a successful career on.",
      "Then Obi scored another, finding the net with an outstanding header.",
      "Coaches can work with strikers for hours on the training ground. They can oversee different finishing drills. But it sometimes boils down to natural finishing instincts in the box.",
      "Obi still has a long way to go, but he appears to have those killer instincts and his performances from the bench haven't done Hojlund any favours.",
      "Hojlund scored 16 goals in all competitions in his first season in Manchester, which was an impressive haul in his debut campaign, but he spectacularly regressed in his second year at the club.",
      "The Denmark international looked burdened by the weight of leading the attack and he netted just four goals in the Premier League, an unacceptable total for a striker at United.",
      "The jury is out on whether Hojlund will get a third bite of the cherry in 2025/2026. United will sign a new striker this summer and Hojlund could be sold. And the 22-year-old might not even be guaranteed to be ahead of Obi in the pecking order if he remains beyond the transfer window.",
      "United are not expected to send Obi on loan for obvious reasons. The young striker has shown that he can mix it at senior level and he still has bags of untapped potential.",
      "Obi is nowhere near his ceiling and some have suggested Hojlund has already reached his."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, May 31.",
      "United's transfer business doesn't appear to be stopping. After agreeing a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, Ruben Amorim's side are continuing to be linked with more attackers to bolster the current crop.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, who is set to join Chelsea for £30million, United are back to square one in their hunt for a new centre-forward. Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director, Matt Hargreaves, is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his high-profile switch, last summer, fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Gyokeres has also been linked to United, owing to his close relationship with Amorim. However, it appears the club are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is also a target for United. However, any more incomings after a striker aren't expected to be pursued until funds are raised through player sales. Unfortunately, that could mean Bruno Fernandes leaves the club amid ongoing links to the lucrative Saudi Pro League.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "A different one here.",
      "According to Football Transfers, Man United have expressed an interest in Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson. It comes after they missed out on Liam Delap, who is joining Chelsea.",
      "Jackson has scored 24 Premier League goals in the past two seasons.",
      "Italian journalist Matteo Moretto has claimed that Juventus have made contact with Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The striker is reportedly one of the forward's the Italian side want to bring in as their top target.",
      "Hello and welcome to our dedicated Manchester United transfer blog!",
      "My name is Josh Holland and I will be your man for all stuff United this Saturday morning. After the blow of Liam Delap turning the club down, Victor Osimhen now seems to be the priority.",

      "Stay tuned as we bring you every rumour, exclusives and opinion throughout the day.",
      "According to The Athletic, Delap will undergo his medical on Monday ahead of a potential move to Chelsea.",
      "The report claims Chelsea met the £30m release clause in the striker's contract. This was activated following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship.",
      "Despite attracting interest from the likes of Man United, AC Milan and Juventus - Delap has informed the Blues over his preference to move to west London.",
      "Chido Obi put in an impressive display for Man United in their post-season fixture against Hong Kong.",
      "The young striker scored twice as United claimed a 3-1 victory at the Hong Kong Stadium. Ayden Heaven was also on the score-sheet after Jorginho put the hosts in front, as United made a second-half comeback with three goals.",
      "Obi currently wears the No.56 shirt for United, which is the same number which was handed to him when he first arrived at Old Trafford and featured for the first-team. This summer could be the time that United put their faith in the striker and give him a new number for the upcoming season.",
      "Several numbers are set to be available to new signings this summer - as well as for current members of the squad who are deserving of an upgrade. If United do decide to give Obi a new number there are several options available. The No.19 is currently vacant at United, having previously been worn by Raphael Varane until his departure in the summer of 2024. No.14 is also set to be available once Christian Eriksen leaves as a free agent.",
      "No.10 is currently worn by Marcus Rashford, No.12 by Tyrell Malacia and No.21 by Antony, with all three men facing uncertain futures going into the summer. United also have every number from 27 up to 36 available, to either new signings or for in-house upgrades.",
      "It has been another remarkable season for Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Clube de Portugal, having won the Liga Portugal Betclic and the Portuguese Cup, while he was also named Player of the Season amid ongoing transfer links to Man United.",
      "As he now prepares to join up with the Sweden national team, coach Jon Dahl Tomasson was inevitably asked whether he could offer any hints about the player's future.",
      "\"Of course, I'm not going to say,\" he said when asked about which club Gyokeres should join. \"Otherwise there would be an explosion. There will definitely be players changing clubs.",
      "\"We know that every year. If we look at each player, the right choice must be made before heading to a certain club. We also have family and we have to keep that in mind. It's not easy. At the end of the day, that is football.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future at Manchester United has become the subject of intense speculation in recent days following the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season.",
      "The news should not come as any real surprise to the club, given the 30-year-old’s response when he signed a contract extension in August last year. At the time, he is said to have made it clear to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he expected the club to sign top-tier players capable of competing at the highest level.",

With interest in the former Troyes man expected to be rife this summer, Bees chief Frank has made it clear the Londoners must attempt to try and command the biggest fee possible for him this summer.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" Frank told Tipsbladet. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",

      "\"I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",

While excited about the opportunities ahead, I am sad to be leaving so many great colleagues and friends at Carrington, who make Manchester United truly special.",

Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence. If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.",

You could see that in the last game [Sunday’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa]. I felt that the team was without pressure and they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes that responsibility. He should be because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, so he’s really important for us, and really important for what we want to build with this team.",

      "Manchester United ended their post-season tour with a 3-1 win against Hong Kong.",
      "The hosts opened the scoring at the Hong Kong Stadium and were leading at half-time, but United looked much better after several substitutions and they turned the game around.",
      "Chido Obi replaced Rasmus Hojlund at the break and scored twice, taking both of his goals brilliantly. Then Ayden Heaven scored in injury time to wrap up the victory.",
      "United will now give their players a chance for a break after a long campaign.",
      "So here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "Hong Kong were under the cosh in the opening 15 minutes of the game, but they weathered the storm and ruthlessly counter-attacked to take the lead through forward Juninho.",
      "Godwill Kukonki could have done better but Tom Heaton was at fault for the goal, allowing the shot to squirm into the net at his front post.",
      "Fernandes was sent through on goal and had a huge chance to equalise, however, he attempted an audacious rabona finish and his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Ka Wing Tse.",
      "In normal circumstances, Fernandes would have drilled the shot into the bottom corner, but he wanted to have fun and attempted a cheeky finish, which tells you what the players think of the post-season friendlies.",
      "Most supporters would have been working while United played Hong Kong, and the fans who weren't might have turned MUTV off before added time when Heaven scored.",
      "United were leading 2-1 and Heaven put the icing on the cake by scoring his first goal for the club in injury time, finding the top left corner after a wonderful cross from Amad.",
      "The defender didn't celebrate, but he did have a smile on his face. Heaven has been a stellar addition considering he was signed for just over £1million from Arsenal in January. Amorim recently gave him the ultimate compliment when he said United need to sign more players like him.",
      "Shortly after Casemiro's goal was disallowed in the fifth minute, he was spotted bickering with Fernandes about something. The pair exchanged a few words and perhaps Fernandes was questioning why the Brazilian was offside.",
      "Casemiro was offside when Fernandes stepped up to take the free-kick and he didn't get back onside quickly enough, which meant his headed goal was chalked off.",
      "It was unnecessary from Casemiro and Fernandes seemed to give him a telling off. That is his responsibility as captain, and there is no standout candidate to inherit the armband if Fernandes signs for Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes is the most vocal member of the dressing room - he constantly dishes out instructions - and other players must step up if he decides to pack his bags for Saudi Arabia this summer.",
      "Jonny Evans made his final appearance for United against Hong Kong and experienced a surreal moment when Tyler Fletcher came on for Shea Lacey just before 30 minutes.",
      "Evans played with Darren Fletcher, Tyler's dad, during his first stint at United and then got the opportunity to play with the son of his close friend, which was a full-circle moment.",
      "The Northern Irishman is expected to retire after the expiry of his contract. Evans said goodbye to Old Trafford on the final day of the campaign and the post-season tour was a chance to say farewell to international fans.",
      "The 37-year-old has been a fantastic servant to his boyhood club and he created memories to cherish, like his goal against Burnley and winning the FA Cup during his second stint.",
      "There are dozens of reasons to criticise United this season, but the team's performances in post-season friendlies in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong should be completely free of scrutiny.",
      "Hong Kong's manager said United need these games \"like a hole in the head,\" and he was right.",
      "United played 60 competitive games throughout the season, but they still flew halfway around the world after facing Aston Villa, with the purpose of raising roughly £10 million in cash.",
      "The post-season friendlies were arranged for purely commercial reasons. The pitch was also awful in Hong Kong, appearing overgrown, which made it difficult to orchestrate decent play.",
      "However, United overcame the conditions and ended the tour on a positive note."

      "A week later, Pinho held discussions with Al-Hilal about a potential transfer for his client.",
      "Pinho was pictured in Saudi Arabia, where he met with Al-Hilal representatives to discuss their interest in Bruno Fernandes, who is considering leaving Old Trafford this summer.",
      "There were murmurs of interest in Fernandes a few weeks ago and Al-Hilal have stepped up their pursuit. They have cash to burn after missing out on Mohamed Salah and Fernandes has been identified as the perfect alternative.",
      "The money on the table is mouthwatering. The potential transfer fee is said to be in the region of £100million and Fernandes could earn £21million per year over a four-year contract.",
      "Fernandes will turn 31 in September and it would be the final bumper contract of his career. The huge money on offer has been enough to lure world-class footballers to Saudi Arabia and Fernandes could be the next.",
      "United have just finished 15th in the Premier League, they were defeated in the Europa League final and won't play European football next season. Fernandes has no reason to stick around.",
      "Loyalty does not exist in modern football, and it would be naive and unfair to expect Fernandes to remain in Manchester purely because he has spent a large chunk of his career at United.",
      "The United captain has given his best years to the club and hasn't got much in return.",
      "The Premier League has never been within his grasp and he's won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, so his agent was right when he posted on social media. Fernandes certainly deserves better.",
      "It would be an immeasurable blow to lose Fernandes, but nobody would blame him if he walks away this summer. Fernandes has been the standard-setter in the dressing room since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in 2020 and most teammates haven't lived up to those standards.",
      "\"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" said Fernandes when he spoke to journalists after the Europa League final.",
      "\"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it.",
      "\"But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "United chiefs might find it difficult to turn down a huge offer from Al-Hilal and, in some ways, it would make sense to cash in considering the fee being mentioned for a 30-year-old player.",
      "That money could be reinvested and provide Ruben Amorim with a war chest to play with in the summer transfer window, but Fernandes is not an ordinary player and United cannot be trusted to reinvest wisely.",
      "United's shocking record in the transfer market does not inspire confidence that strong signings would offset Fernandes' departure, which is exactly why he must be kept this summer.",
      "Although the worst season in the club's modern history has just ended, there will be more pain if Fernandes leaves for Al-Hilal. Fernandes offers just as much away from the pitch as he does on it.",
      "He is an example to young players, he trains well and has tight relationships with all different kinds of staff at Carrington, so moral could be an issue if he departed.",
      "It felt like the situation couldn't get worse at Old Trafford, but maybe it can."

      "Leading the line for Manchester United is such an unappealing and onerous task that a City reject has rejected them. A United striker finally emerged as their matchwinner in Hong Kong.",
      "Chido Obi, the more frugal and callow Danish striker signing by United, clinically claimed his maiden goal for the first team. Obi replaced Rasmus Hojlund at half-time and took five minutes to crash the ball into the net. And crash the WiFi.",
      "Liam Delap’s decision to join Chelsea over United is merely a stay of execution for Hojlund. United need a proven goalscorer, not one born four days after Hojlund and jettisoned by City’s academy to a promoted team who Jason Wilcox watched develop. United tried to cut corners with Delap’s release clause when they need a proven commodity.",
      "Obi is not ready for competitive matches but his goals will do him no harm. Just as impressive as his equalising strike was his reaction. He eschewed celebrations in favour of fishing the ball out of the net.",
      "The 17-year-old ought to have converted with one header and the next time he rose to meet the ball he glanced it into the corner. With fan favourites long since substituted, the crowd in the Hong Kong Stadium switched their affections to Obi.",
      "Obi was still pressing intensely in added time. One of United staff’s bugbears with Hojlund is they reckon he does not exert himself enough. Obi applied himself as though he sensed an opportunity. His tour ended with a man of the match award.",
      "His winning goal fuelled such optimism that there was a rendition of “Glory glory Man United” from the Hong Kong crowd. Whoever United’s starting striker is next season, Obi has had enough time around the first team to at least remain involved in that set-up for what will be a sparser season without European football.",
      "There was little to savour when he scored his first goal as United were 1-0 down again. Their first half performance was in keeping with their annus horribilis; not scoring before conceding. United conceded the first goal in 32 of their 60 competitive games and they have tagged on a couple more in the post-season.",
      "United had 15 attempts to Hong Kong’s one in the first half. No prizes for guessing which side scored. United encountered a Sergio Aguero in Kuala Lumpur. This time, the namesake of another scourge from their past was on target in Juninho.",
      "At least the outcome was different for United this time. The mood was described as “downbeat” after the loss to ASEAN All-Stars, if you can believe that, and as meaningless as these matches are many at the club will breathe a sigh of relief that they avoided a second defeat in Asia.",
      "The players will not be doom-scrolling on their smartphones when they board their flight back to Manchester on Friday evening.",
      "This was certainly a farewell appearance for Jonny Evans and possibly Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim had been asked at his pre-match press conference whether both would start after Lionel Messi caused a furore in Hong Kong last year by withdrawing from an Inter Miami exhibition match. Fernandes and Garnacho were in the United line-up that pressed the flesh of local dignitaries.",
      "Fernandes elicited cheers when he appeared on the large screen and there was a hearty cry of \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\" from the crowd as he lined up for a free kick. The adoration was louder for Garnacho on the ball.",
      "The United captain was still his usual self, bickering with Casemiro after his teammate strayed offside for a disallowed goal and advising Harry Amass to chest the ball rather than hopefully stick his leg out.",
      "Fernandes might have signed-off with one of his most audacious United goals but his one-on-one rabona - when one leg is wrapped around the other to poke the ball forward - was repelled. Hojlund naturally miscontrolled the ball on the follow-up before Jaydan Kamason’s drive was blocked on the line.",
      "It sounded suspiciously like a fan wielding a megaphone shouted, “Garnacho, you’re f*****g s**t.” Garnacho can take criticism to heart and was soon on his haunches on a cool and wet evening. It transpired that the fleeting rendition emanated from a section populated by Hong Kong fans.",
      "The Hong Kong ‘keeper Tse Ka Wing kept out Hojlund and Garnacho before Shea Lacey screwed a clear chance well wide. Lacey was substituted before the half-hour mark yet it was an achievement for him to be in Asia after a season where he was restricted to four starts for the academy. Starting for the first team was an unexpected reward.",

Beyond that, there is little recent evidence to suggest United would actually be able to reinvest any would-be windfall from the 78-cap Portuguese sufficiently anyway.",

      "By and large, things have not exactly gone to plan for the former Chelsea player since Erik ten Hag and key figures upstairs were convinced enough to pay £65million for his signature. So much faith and trust was put in Mount that handing him the club's iconic No.7 shirt was also a major part in negotiations before his high-profile arrival.",
      "Not a blessing, as yet, the No.7 curse continues at Old Trafford, but there is hope that can change.",
      "Mount was imperious as United booked their place in this season's Europa League final with a second-leg win over Athletic Bilbao in their last-four showdown. That eye-catching cameo was enough to see him return to the starting XI for the showpiece - incidentally in Bilbao against Tottenham - not to mention revive expectation around him.",

      "Delap wanted his future resolved before the European Under 21 Championship starts and the 22-year-old is believed to favour a transfer to Chelsea. United have declined to comment.",
      "United, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Everton all held talks with Delap, who has a £30million release clause following Ipswich's relegation.",
      "Senior figures at United expected Delap to choose between them and Chelsea, who qualified for the Champions League last week and won the Europa Conference League on Wednesday night.",
      "The MEN reported earlier this month that United were wary that Delap was generating interest from other Premier League clubs.",
      "Delap was identified as United’s primary striker target after they ended the Premier League season with a derisory 44 goals and a -10 goal difference.",
      "Manchester City academy graduate Delap scored 12 Premier League goals for Ipswich last season, having signed for the club last year. Delap came through at City when United technical director Jason Wilcox was the club's academy director.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim lamented the “lack of goals” in the squad once again after the club lost their first post-season tour match to the ASEAN All Stars in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Amorim wants to replace Rasmus Hojlund after the £72m striker mustered ten goals in 2024-25. Hojlund struggled in his 45-minute outing of the 1-0 defeat on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations,\" Amorim said afterwards when asked about Hojlund. \"Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence.",
      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.\""

      "Manchester United were dealt a transfer hammer blow by Liam Delap's decision to reject their advances and instead choose Chelsea as his next home.",
      "The striker had his pick of leading Premier League clubs after shining for relegated Ipswich Town this season. His £30million release clause made him an obtainable target and with United, who are closing in on a £62.5million deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, not flush with cash this summer Delap's price point and quality made him an attractive option.",
      "Instead, United are paying the price for a dismal Premier League campaign and losing the Europa League final earlier this month which ended any hope of European football at Old Trafford next season. Delap seems set to complete his move to Stamford Bridge imminently.",
      "So what next? United are desperate to sign a striker this summer given Rasmus Hojlund's struggles and Joshua Zirkee's preference to play deeper. In an ideal world, Ruben Amorim would be chasing a reunion with Sporting Lisbon powerhouse Viktor Gyokeres, or joining the race for the talented Benjamin Sesko or the free agent Jonathan David. But all three will want Champions league football and United don't have it.",
      "Even the proven top flight alternatives to Delap, the likes of Brentford star Yoane Wissa and Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta could be financially out of reach for United with Premier League signings often attracting a premium.",
      "It means the Reds might have to cast the net further afield in their search for attacking options. And a look at the Bundesliga could provide an answer.",
      "A look down the list of top scorers, which is led by Harry Kane, sees the unheralded Jonathan Burkardt in fourth. The striker hit 18 goals last term to fire Mainz into Europe.",
      "At 24, he has more than 100 senior appearances for Mainz, who often deploy a 3-4-3 shape not dissimilar to Amorim's formation at United, under his belt and has broken into the Germany national side. Indeed, he is a candidate to be starting forward for his country when the 2026 World Cup rolls around next year.",
      "He's long been touted as a potential star in the making in his homeland and is now delivering on that promise.",
      "And the added bonus is he has a reported €20million release clause in his contract. He is attracting interest from Eintracht Frankfurt, who are pushing for a deal, and has only been tentatively linked with United.",
      "But as the Reds seek to strike a balance between the football and financial, Burkardt could be a viable option.",
      "United were woeful in front of in the 2024-25 campaign, but the addition of Cunha as a number 10 will likely improve that tally, while Burkardt is more of a line-leading presence than Hojlund.",
      "The German is far from the perfect solution, but if his price, pedigree and potential allow United to bolster their striker ranks and potentially add new signings elsewhere, he could be a shrewd summer investment."

      "The season has finished and Manchester United are still finding a way to lose football matches.",
      "United faced ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur in front of 72,000 supporters and they suffered a 1-0 defeat after a second half goal from Maung Maung Lwin.",
      "Maung Maung Lwin is not a household name, but he might become famous in Malaysia after taking the scalp of United. The result of the post-season friendly does not matter, although there were a few interesting aspects of the contest, including the involvement of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at the interval and Garnacho was introduced, despite having been told before the final day of the season he could find a new club this summer.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Speaking before the Aston Villa match, Amorim confirmed that Garnacho would still travel on the post-season tour. It's possible that the only reason Garnacho has been included on the trip is to protect his transfer value.",
      "Garnacho was omitted from the squad on the final day of the campaign, but he was still given minutes against ASEAN All-Stars, which suggests to the outside world that it's business as usual.",
      "The reality is the relationship between Garnacho and Amorim seems to have broken down, and if that is the case, it damages United's power in negotiations in the summer window.",
      "Garnacho could potentially fetch a transfer fee of £70million, but suitors will submit lower offers if they know United want to sell the winger because Amorim wants him out of the door.",
      "That means including Garnacho on the post-season tour and giving him minutes is perhaps a clever ploy to protect his value. Interested clubs, like Napoli and Chelsea, will probably see right through the tactic, but it's better to have Garnacho involved with the first team than frozen out.",
      "It's obviously difficult to sell a player for their market value when a public decision has already been communicated, so Amorim must do what he can to protect his bargaining power.",
      "Garnacho was pictured with a huge smile when the post-season team photo was taken at Manchester Airport, but he didn't look quite so cheery during exchanges with Malaysian fans the day before facing ASEAN All-Stars - it must be added that a long-distance flight and more games after a draining season are enough to leave any player feeling glum.",
      "It's a shame to see Garnacho's time at Old Trafford end on a sour note, if indeed he does leave this summer, but he has crossed managers on too many occasions. Amorim has reiterated he is still a United player, which seems in name only.",
      "Garnacho's last game for United looks set to be on tour in Hong Kong this week."

The lyrics refer to winning the Football League again in Merseyside and namecheck Ryan Giggs, Gary Pallister, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "Amorim clasped hands and received a warm embrace from the United chief executive Omar Berrada when he collected his medal. He removed it immediately.",
      "\"My biggest concern is that we need to have the feeling that we need to win every game,\" Ruben Amorim said, \"even a small-sided game on the street, that kind of feeling every game, every exercise that is what we have to do to push the players.\"",
      "Nobody feels sorry for the United players after the season they have subjected their supporters to. Whether these players stay or go, the humiliation of losing a final to Tottenham and then to fire blanks again in Malaysia a week later is form that warrants boos.",
      "The last time United were booed on domestic soil was at half-time against Leicester City in the FA Cup fourth round back in February. Leicester somehow lost to United four times in 2024-25 but they threatened a shock that night until Harry Maguire made the most of a linesman's myopia.",
      "Since then, United matchgoers have sworn by harmonious atmospheres. Their end in the San Mames Stadium emptied quicker than a bathtub of water, which was their form of expressing disapproval. United fans are very dignified like that.",
      "Four days later against Aston Villa, there was no pre-match rancour and 'We'll never die' got an early and defiant airing. United also played well and won.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, they were back on unwatchable form. Collyer was booed for playing the ball into touch with United 1-0 down. At full-time, there was more booing.",
      "Amorim understood it. \"I feel always guilty of the performance of the team since I am here in the first game,\" he admitted. \"I am guilty then the boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League, they were always there. I felt when we finished every time the supporters were with us. Let's see for next season.\"",
      "There were 27 substitutions by Amorim alone. In an occasion that was as far removed from a competitive match as possible - a light show, a Mexican wave, innumerable substitutions - Rasmus Hojlund was still isolated, detached and sloppy.",
      "Hojlund left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in a cheerful mood, cracking a brief joke with a United press officer. At Amorim's press conference, Hojlund was described as \"a shadow of himself\" and \"hesitant\" by a local reporter.",
      "Maybe Hojlund has seen the writing on the wall. United are waiting on a decision from Liam Delap, only four days younger than Hojlund. Delap would cost half the price, too. But if Delap returns to Manchester it will be to replace Hojlund.",
      "\"Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations,\" Amorim said in response to the query about Hojlund. \"Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season. Even the environment in the training ground can help all these players have more confidence.",
      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals. We will try to assess that and be prepared.\"",
      "Amorim was already on the United coach when Garnacho strode out, sunglasses on, scanning his phone. Garnacho completely blanked those assembled in the mixed zone, which had descended more into a meet-and-greet pen.",
      "Amorim usually sits in the front row of the coach, so Garnacho will have had to have walked past him. Wearing sunglasses more befitting a superhero with midnight looming in Kuala Lumpur suggested he was trying to make a point.",
      "There is no power struggle between manager and player. It is a non-contest as United have backed Amorim after he told Garnacho that he can leave.",
      "Garnacho did, however, generate genuine adoration from the crowd, along with Bruno Fernandes, the renascent Harry Maguire and, somewhat peculiarly, Andre Onana. Onana, Maguire and Diogo Dalot are now bound for a commercial trek to India while their teammates head on to Hong Kong.",
      "Fernandes was the last to leave and he generously signed some shirts and stopped for pictures. United were in no rush. They were staying in the city another night after defeat.",

      "Manchester United are set to miss out on the signing of Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap amid his preference to join Chelsea.",
      "United had identified the 22-year-old as an attainable target to strengthen their attacking options ahead of next season after Ipswich's relegation triggered a £30million release clause in his contract.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, as well as being the subject of interest from United and Chelsea, has also held talks with Everton and Newcastle United recently. He scored 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "With United now set to miss out on the former Stoke City and Hull City loanee, MEN Sport has picked out five alternatives who the Reds could potentially consider to spearhead their attack.",
      "United have been linked with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this week, but news of Delap's expected switch to Stamford Bridge could force the Reds to target one of his teammates instead.",
      "Wissa, 28, scored 19 Premier League goals this season, successfully filling the void that had been vacated by Ivan Toney last summer. He led Brentford's attack throughout the season and was only outscored by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23), Erling Haaland (22), Chris Wood (20) and Mbeumo (20) in the Premier League.",
      "The former FC Lorient man also scored 12 times in the Premier League last season, meaning his tally of 32 over the last two seasons means he has netted more top flight goals in that period than Mbeumo, who so often dominates the Brentford headlines.",
      "Establishing himself as a consistent source of goals in the Premier League, Wissa is likely to be a target for a lot of clubs this summer. His contract at the Gtech Community Stadium is up in 2026, but Brentford have the option of an additional year, which they would almost certainly trigger to protect his soaring valuation.",
      "Like Wissa, Mateta is another striker who exceeded expectations for one of the Premier League's mid-table clubs this season, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, of which 14 were netted in the league.",
      "Since initially arriving at Selhurst Park on loan in January 2021, the Frenchman's all-round game has improved, and that has been reflected in his increased attacking output. After scoring 16 goals in the Premier League last season, his tally of 14 this time around demonstrates that he is now an established goal-getter.",
      "Under contract at Palace until 2027, Mateta is excellent at holding the ball up and bringing others into play, meaning he could be an ideal fit for Ruben Amorim's team, where the two No.10s are tasked with operating close to the central striker.",
      "If United decide that Mateta is a realistic alternative to Delap, the problem they could face is that Palace have European football to offer the striker next season after qualifying for the Europa League via their FA Cup triumph at Wembley earlier this month. Being unable to offer European football at Old Trafford could hold United back in their search for a striker.",
      "Strikers of David's pedigree do not come on the market all that often. The fact he is available for free this summer after deciding to leave Lille means that he will be a very attractive option for a number of clubs.",
      "The Canadian spent five years at Lille, scoring 109 goals in 232 appearances, establishing himself as one of Europe's most consistent goalscorers. United have been heavily linked with him in the past and he would be an excellent signing on a free transfer.",
      "However, David played in the Champions League this season and scored seven goals in ten appearances, meaning he will have aspirations of playing in the competition again next season. The likes of Liverpool, Newcastle and Barcelona have all been linked with him and will each play in the Champions League in 2025/26.",
      "It means United are highly unlikely to be able to lure David to M16, even though he would not require a transfer fee. It is when you look at players of his ilk that you begin to grasp a real understanding of just how costly failing to qualify for the Champions League could be.",
      "United have been linked with Osimhen countless times in previous years and now would be as good a time as any to bring him to Old Trafford. He will leave Napoli this summer on a permanent basis after falling out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago.",
      "He spent this season on loan at Turkish side Galatasaray and scored a whopping 36 goals in 40 matches across all competitions. He also racked up eight assists.",
      "Already being linked with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, United may face a race against the clock to try and lure him to Old Trafford. Some reports have claimed he could be available for around €40m.",
      "In this modern era, a fee in that region for a goalscorer as prolific as Osimhen, who is entering the prime of his career at the age of 26, represents good value. He has scored 84 goals since the beginning of the 2022/23 season for Napoli and Galatasaray combined.",
      "However, a lack of European football could hold United back. He scored six times in seven Europa League appearances this season."

      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is ‘very close’ to leaving Old Trafford for Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have been terrible this season with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing the season in 15th position after a final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "Their summer transfer budget took a hit earlier this month when they failed to qualify for the Champions League after losing to Tottenham 1-0 in the Europa League final.",
      "And there are rumours Man Utd could now have to sell a number of their players in order to have the transfer window they want this summer with Fernandes linked to Saudi Arabia.",
      "There is talk that Al-Hilal are willing to offer as much as £100m to Man Utd in order to get a deal done, while there have been claims the salary package on offer is worth an incredible £65m a year.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes insists that Fernandes is ‘very close’ to leaving Man Utd with Al-Hilal ‘willing to go all out to close the deal’.",
      "READ: Man Utd’s seven striker options after Liam Delap snubbed them for Chelsea",
      "It is claimed that an ‘offer’ of €95m (£80m) is ‘on the table’ currently for Fernandes with ‘the player’s entourage is also seriously considering the offer’.",
      "Al-Hilal ‘not only promises a contract worthy of his status, but is also offering a staggering sum: €25 million net for each of the seasons he signs at his new destination.’",
      "“Never say never in the transfer market, the window hasn’t even opened yet. Anything could eventually happen.",
      "“I just watched Ruben Amorim there and he would have been told by his media handlers: ‘You’re going to be asked about this story, it’s a massive story – just play it with a straight bat and say he’s a Manchester United player and he’s got two years left on his contract, I’m not going to talk about media speculation.’",
      "“He didn’t do that. He came out and gave us quite a lot.",
      "“You could tell he’s spoken to Bruno Fernandes and been told by him: ‘I’ve got this incredible offer, it’s like I’ve won Euro Millions, £200m over three years. This is life-changing money, boss but you know I’m not motivated by money. I love football, I love Manchester United.’",
      "“I think he’s sat down and spoken to Ruben Amorim and he’s told him he is an integral part of the rebuild at Manchester United. I think he’s happy to stay.”",
      "On Al-Hilal, Solhekol added: “The clock is ticking for Al Hilal because they are playing in the Club World Cup.",
      "“They don’t have a head coach, they’ve been trying to sign Ronaldo, they’ve been trying to sign Bruno Fernandes, they’re trying to get Simone Inzaghi out of Inter.",
      "“There is a lot going on at Hilal because they are flying the flag for Saudi Arabia at the Club World Cup.”",
      "A pundit has told Manchester United they would “probably be relegated” without a star who is reportedly considering quitting the club this summer.",

      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",

      "Sure, United are in a bad place, primarily down to utterly appalling recruitment over the past 8-10-12 years, but the club isn’t dead just yet.",
      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",
      "But that didn’t stop Bournemouth, Forest, Fulham, Villa (to name but a few) all climbing the table in recent seasons.",
      "Forest were many pundits’ picks for relegation last year, and having unearthed (amongst others) two very cheap diamonds in central defense, pushed for the top 4 until the very last game of the season. Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",
      "The point being, just because we cant have a summer of getting all the current fad names, doesn’t mean we’re done and dusted. Ok, I agree that the squad needs some decent additions, but at least our transfer business is getting better.",
      "6-8 years ago, we’d go and pay crazy money for names like Pogba and Di Maria, and then get frustrated when they didn’t return value. And fill in the gaps with loans of Falcao etc. Yuk.",
      "2-4 years ago was utterly disastrous – Sancho, Antony, (if Greenwood hadn’t smacked his girlfriend, we’d have saved £150m not having to buy those two), Hojlund (nowhere near value, but think he’s been unlucky, if still below average). I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",
      "Last season – far better. Mazraoui, good value. De Ligt – meh, at least we didn’t pay 75, 40 was probably about right if he can stay fit. Yoro – looks a decent player and will only improve. Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",
      "Amorim’s only signings so far: Dorgu – I’ve seen fans moaning about him cos he’s not playing like peak Roberto Carlos. The kid is 20 years old ….. what is it with people nowadays. He will get better, stronger, brighter. And Heaven, £1.5m for an 18 year old who already looks pretty useful, definitely great value.",

      "That said; with Villa in financial strife and Forest not making the CL those two clubs have four players I would be all over; Gibbs-White, Tielemans, Rodgers and Murillo. Not all of them as they’ll cost a king’s ransom but I can see at least one big names from both sides being snapped up.",
      "Bournemouth aren’t desperate for cash anymore but Semenyo is a terrific player, however if Kerkez does go along with Huijsen then I can’t see a world where they sell their three best players.",

      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling. And they shouldn’t be blaming the Premier League for that.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "Speaking to RAC1, Deco said: “Talking about players who have contracts with other clubs is complicated out of respect. We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players. When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.",
      "“Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home, renewals of Pedri, Gavi, Araujo, Raphinha, Kounde… I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine is the best signing in history.",

      "Here are 10 individuals prompting dips in the Premier League shame well.",
      "",
      "Vitinha\nWolves fans can take some solace in the fact that if Vitinha had been putting in anything like the sort of performances he is for Paris Saint-Germain right now in his season at Molineux, he would be bound for brighter things anyway.",
      "But we assume there’s a certain amount of regret on the part of the Wolves chiefs that Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t give him the chance to prove himself worthy of the £17m required to make his loan move from Porto permanent in the summer of 2021 given he’s now valued at £50m by Transfermarkt and a helluva lot more by PSG, who have every right to claim they have the best central midfielder on the planet right now.",
      "",
      "Luis Enrique\nHe was the betting favourite to take over at Arsenal in 2018, but the board plumped for Unai Emery to replace Arsene Wenger as they felt Enrique was both too expensive and too ‘self-absorbed’ after coaching Barcelona to a Treble.",
      "Chelsea questioned his ‘temperament’ as they looked for Antonio Conte’s replacement before giving no specific reason for snubbing him again after face-to-face talks in their ‘exhaustive’ and exhausting process to find a new boss after Graham Potter.",
      "And if it wasn’t for a winter World Cup, Enrique may currently be in charge of Manchester United, or at least would have been for a time…",
      "",
      "Yann Sommer\nSommer was very high on Manchester United’s shortlist to replace David De Gea in the summer of 2023, and although Bayern Munich swooped in the January window to ruin the Red Devils’ chances of a free transfer, it was Inter who then took advantage of a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with the Bundesliga club to secure his £6m signing as a replacement for the guy United bought for £44m as their new No.1.",
      "And while Sommer has played a vital role in securing Inter’s place in the Champions League final, pulling off several remarkable saves in the knockout stages, United got to the Europa League final in spite of Andre Onana, who then definitely could have done better to deny Brennan Johnson his winning goal for Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Matteo Darmian\nLike you might thank an unattractive ex-girlfriend for dumping you as you stand next to your perfect wife, reflecting on his four-season career break at Old Trafford having helped Inter to the Champions League final in 2023, Darmian said: “I have to say thank you to them [United] because if I’m the player and person that I am, it’s also because of them.”",
      "He’s now set for another Champions League final after over 200 appearances for Inter, two Scudettos and two Coppa Italias. On his behalf, again, thank you Manchester United.",

      "Henrikh Mkhitaryan\nIf you believe this list to be just another way for us to take unnecessary potshots at Manchester United and kick them while they’re down, you’re not wrong but also must concede that a) it’s impossible to resist to given the regularity off their f*ck-ups, and b) it remains excellent fun.",
      "Mkhitaryan counts as another misstep, but his imminent part in a second Champions League final is more embarrassing for Arsenal, who bought him for the price of an Alexis Sanchez after 18 inauspicious months at Old Trafford ahead of similar humdrum displays at the Emirates before he left for Serie A on a free transfer in 2020.",
      "",
      "Ousmane Dembele\nThere’s no specific club-shaming here, but pretty much all of the big boys have been linked with Dembele at some point over the last five years or so – Arsenal in a swap deal with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang perhaps the most notable – and we’re guessing the bigwigs were of a similar mind to the rest of us in thinking they needed to steer clear of a Fancy Dan who was destined to never reach a full potential that he has now realised in spectacular fashion during a 33-goal, 13-assist season for PSG.",

      "A pundit has told Manchester United they would “probably be relegated” without a star who is reportedly considering quitting the club this summer.",
      "United had their worst season in Premier League history in 2024-25. After finishing eighth the season prior, they slumped down to 15th in the top flight.",
      "Only three players, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho, scored more than five goals in the Premier League.",
      "Discussing the future of Fernandes on talkSPORT, Troy Deeney suggested United’s season would have been very bleak without him",
      "“You can’t deny his quality. If it wasn’t for him this season, they probably would be relegated.”",
      "United finished on 42 points, 17 ahead of the final relegated side, Leicester. Given Fernandes scored eight goals and assisted another 11, without him, things could indeed have been much worse for them.",
      "That is pertinent for the upcoming season, with a lot of speculation over the attacking midfielder’s potential exit. It’s said Fernandes’ agent has held ‘positive talks’ with Al Hilal over a very lucrative contract there, and he’s ‘giving serious thought to quitting’ United.",
      "Indeed, he’s said to be mulling over the proposal, with the Saudi Arabian side wanting an answer from Fernandes soon, as they’d like him for the Club World Cup if he was to be signed, which begins on June 14.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the United man would actually give up on the Old Trafford outfit, given he stated after the Europa League final loss: “I have always been honest. I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go.",
      "“I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "“If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.”",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is ‘very close’ to leaving Old Trafford for Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could now ‘quit’ the Red Devils as his potential future takes yet another U-turn, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are in something of a mess and it could end in bankruptcy. But should they sell Bruno Fernandes?",
      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports."

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘reignite’ their interest in two strikers after losing out to Chelsea on the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap.",
      "United have been linked with a number of the world’s top strikers of late. It’s evident they need some quality in attack, after neither Rasmus Hojlund nor Joshua Zirkzee managed more than five Premier League goals this season, despite both playing north of 30 games.",
      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",
      "However, multiple outlets have stated Delap has instead agreed to sign with Chelsea, and GIVEMESPORT states that after United were ‘unable to convince’ him to sign, they will move onto ‘alternative options’.",
      "It’s been reported as a ‘major blow’ for Delap to have been taken off the board, but it means the Red Devils will apparently ‘reignite their interest’ in Randal Kolo Muani and Jean-Philippe Mateta, from Paris Saint-Germain and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "It is said United will ‘make checks’ over whether Kolo Muani would be an ideal fit, after they considered recruiting him in January, when he went on loan to Juventus – he scored eight goals in 16 Serie A games there.",
      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",
      "As such Mateta has come back into their thinking, especially after playing a key role in Palace winning the FA Cup. He assisted a goal in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa, while the Palace man has been in electric form in the Premier League recently.",
      "This season, Mateta scored 14 goals and assisted two. The report places him at £40million, though our friends at TEAMtalk suggest the Eagles would not let him go for less than £50million.",
      "They state that negotiations could be tricky, as Palace are keen to retain Mateta. He will play European football with them for the first time in his career, and that’s something which is not on offer at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign a PL star as one of four ‘fallback’ striker options as Omar Berrada’s relationship with an agent hampers a £63m deal.",
      "Manchester United have made ‘initial contact’ with a £40m striker ahead of the summer transfer window as an alternative to Ipswich’s Liam Delap.",
      "Ally McCoist has stated he has not been “convinced” by Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres yet, but feels a Premier League player who was suggested as good for the Gunners has ...",
      "Club football is back! Hurrah! But the Premier League isn’t! Boo! But that’s because it’s FA Cup quarter-final weekend! Hurrah!",
      "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta has commented on his injury after his “ear was destroyed” in a clash with Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts.",
      "With the end of season in sight, the race for Champions League qualification could be huge for Newcastle United in the fates of two strikers."

      "United have some catching up to do in the Premier League. They finished 15th in the season just gone – their worst finish in the history of the competition.",
      "They will reportedly soon confirm the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, for £62.5million. The Red Devils will hope that the Brazilian fares better than other recent expensive attackers.",

      "“I wouldn’t be averse to him going on loan for six months, to score goals, find his feet, and get a bit of confidence. People don’t understand that when you play for Manchester United, it’s about the mentality and dealing with the expectations.”",
      "Many believed United were overpaying for Hojlund, as he’d played a single season at Atalanta prior to heading to Old Trafford, in which he scored just 10 goals.",
      "The season just gone has shown that he has clearly not made the jump that United hopes he might, and that could lead to a transfer away.",

He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.",

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6=) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",
      "",
      "10) Napoli\nAfter seeing Scott McTominay become a hero in Naples, is there a part of Rashford that would like a slice of the same?",
      "",
      "",
      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is set to move to Barcelona in the summer transfer window after the clubs came to an agreement, according to reports.",
      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "Man Utd have ‘asked’ Barcelona for one of two £42m players in exchange for Marcus Rashford as Deco ‘values the idea of a sacrifice’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have named their ‘affordable price’ to sell Marcus Rashford amid interest from FC Barcelona.",
      "Manchester United decision-makers Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are reportedly set to meet with Ruben Amorim soon, and the club’s ‘desperation’ will see the future of Marcus Rashford made a ..."

      "It has been a fair while since we had a properly classic Champions League final. We take you from a goalless snooze-fest at 32 to the obvious No.1.",
      "",
      "32) 2003 – Juventus 0-0 Milan (2-3 on penalties)\nIt might seem reductive to consider the only goalless Champions League final as the worst, but the 2003 edition truly was a slog. It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",
      "Their Serie A meetings that season ended in a 2-1 win apiece but Old Trafford was treated to nothing of the sort. Even half the penalties were missed in the shootout as Dida ventured ever so slightly off his line.",
      "",
      "31) 2004 – Monaco 0-3 Porto\nTo prove that goals do not necessarily equate to a pulsating game, watch the 2004 Champions League final and retain your consciousness for the full 90 minutes. An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",
      "It was also the first European Cup final to be moved back from a Wednesday to a Saturday, which remains one of the great first-world injustices of our time.",
      "",
      "29) 1993 – Marseille 1-0 Milan\nUEFA would perhaps rather the world forgot about the winner of its first revamped Champions League; the rest of the world would happily forget the final itself. Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",
      "After the ridiculous drama of the respective semi-finals, this was perhaps an understandable anti-climax and a case of the result being so very much more important than the performance.",
      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",
      "📣TO THE COMMENTS! What was your favourite and least favourite Champions League final? Join the debate here",
      "",
      "17) 2016 – Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (5-3 on penalties)\nIn terms of grit and battle, 2016 offered up precisely what one might expect from a Madrid derby helmed by Zinedine Zidane and Diego Simeone. A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",
      "",
      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",
      "",
      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",
      "",
      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

      "",
      "4) 1994 – Milan 4-0 Barcelona\nIf irresistible dominance is your preference – and no-one is here to kink shame – the 1994 Champions League final is a classic of the genre. Milan were without a number of injured and suspended players but ruthlessly dismantled Barcelona all the same. It just would have been nice if the Spaniards had turned up.",
      "",
      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",
      "",
      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout. Add substitute Lars Ricken lobbing Angelo Peruzzi with his first touch and you have a classic.",
      "",
      "1) 2005 – Milan 3-3 Liverpool (2-3 on penalties)\nIt’s not really a contest. Nor should this have been and, indeed, at one point nor was it. A Milan side littered with generational brilliance scored the earliest goal in Champions League final history and then the best to lead 3-0 at half-time before annoying Steven Gerrard by “waving to their families”.",
      "Liverpool were unfathomably level by the 60th minute and won their fifth European Cup on penalties over a shellshocked Italian side. That extra-time double save by Jerzy Dudek from Andriy Shevchenko still defies laws of gravity and common decency.",

      "The Red Devils had the opportunity to salvage something from this season as they faced Spurs in the Europa League final, with a trophy, huge prize money and Champions League qualification up for grabs.",
      "But Man Utd did not turn up as they were deservedly beaten and Amorim is currently among the facourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",

      "“It’s still Ten Hag’s team which was built for a different style, so now you’re seeing what happens when you play people out of position or in a system that many of them aren’t comfortable.",
      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",
      "“They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of winning the Europa League and that performance was absolutely pathetic. Fans can understand performances dropping in the weeks before the final, but you have to show up, and they were diabolical. So the jury still has to be out.”",
      "Ince has also hit out at Man Utd’s board as they should have been in the ‘race” to sign two Liverpool stars.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s side have had a nightmare season with the current Red Devils squad going down as the worst Man Utd outfit in the Premier League era.",
      "Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag in November, failed to improve performances and results with Man Utd ending the campaign in 15th position.",
      "Many of their players have come under fire as the Red Devils underperformed with Hojlund only managing to scored four Premier League goals despite starting most matches.",
      "Mount, who signed from Chelsea for £55m in 2023, has been sidelined for much of the season with the England international making 31 league appearances in the last two campaigns.",
      "And now former Man Utd defender Parker reckons Hojlund and Mount should leave in the summer for the good of their career and the Red Devils.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘at bottom of a six foot hole’ but Bruno still surely unsellable",
      "Parker told Betano: “Rasmus Hojlund has to leave Manchester United for the sake of his own career. He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.",
      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.",
      "“If you look at the starting XI for the Europa League final, 70% or 80% could be going. The current group of players proved they couldn’t cut it. If the players haven’t got it, in their heart and in their heads, you can’t change that. If you look at last season, Man Utd shouldn’t be anywhere near that level again in my lifetime.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirmed earlier this week that Man Utd will “formally” sign Wolves forward Matheus Cunha next week.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘No doubt since Sunday night: Matheus Cunha will be Manchester United player from Wolves for £62.5m release clause paid in installments.",
      "‘Verbal agreement done on Sunday and to be formally signed next week, as always planned.",
      "‘Here we go, confirmed. ✅’",
      "And Parker has had his say on the imminent signing with Cunha to bring the “arrogance” that Man Utd – who are second in the Premier League’s five-year net spend table – have been missing in recent years.",
      "Parker added: “I like Matheus Cunha. He’ll be the most natural athlete at Manchester United because they haven’t got any athletes. He’s willing to run behind people, he’s quite quick and he plays with an arrogance because he believes in his ability.",
      "“Manchester United haven’t got those types of players at the moment. They’ve got some players with arrogance, but it’s the wrong kind of arrogance.",
      "“Cunha is going to make a difference, but he’s only one player, that’s not enough. Signing him won’t be enough. There’ll be a lot of disillusioned fans if there’s no movement and if they go into their first preseason game without new players.”",
      "Paul Ince has revealed his opinion that an expensive Manchester United forward is “not ready” to play for the club as he feels they should allow him to leave and ...",
      "According to reports, Liverpool ‘stepped away’ from signing Manchester United-bound Matheus Cunha from Wolves for three key reasons.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "Here is our Premier League disappointment XI, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Spurs all represented.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘met the terms’ to sign Matheus Cunha from Premier League rivals Wolves after having a ‘request rejected’.",
      "Inter Milan are edging closer to a summer transfer for Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund after identifying him as their ‘dream’ target, according to reports."

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nWe love him and really don’t want him, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton or anyone else to leave Palace ahead of their Europa League campaign as Oliver Glasner – having already won it once before with Frankfurt – could do something really rather special with this group if he can keep them together.",
      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",
      "Reports suggest Bayer Leverkusen would be open to bids of around £30m for a striker who could probably be tempted by a move to any Premier League team – with or without European football – such is his long-held desire to play in the English top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko, who have been linked with the top-tier clubs looking for strikers this summer, have both had £80m-£100m price tags slapped on them despite scoring 15 and 13 Bundesliga goals respectively.",
      "Schick would be a relatively low risk, cheap option for United.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nTalking of risk, Nkunku might just be the most perilous option. He’s done nothing at Chelsea to suggest he’s got what it takes to be a Premier League footballer. He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nHis signing is unlikely to be widely heralded by the United fanbase on the basis of a Premier League career which saw him score just four goals in 39 appearances for Everton having been seen as quite the transfer coup when Marco Silva persuaded him to join from Juventus in 2019. He was only a kid at the time though and has developed his game in the meantime to become a far more rounded striker.",
      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "We won’t profess to have seen Burkardt in action enough to make a claim over his suitability to United in terms of style, but everything about a move for him feels pretty perfect besides an eye test which we’re 100% sure would lead us to insist he’s a better bet than Hojlund.",
      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their preferred striker signing after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "12 of the top 100 most valuable footballers are almost certain to leave their current clubs this summer and we’ve predicted where they’ll end up.",
      "Wayne Rooney reckons Man Utd should look to sign two of Chelsea’s top targets this summer as they close in on their first deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have four strikers on their ‘shortlist’, with a former Premier League flop in a ‘renaissance’ among their options."

So Cunha could replace Bruno’s attacking output, at least in terms of goal involvements, if not in terms of creating chances for our non-existent strikers.",

I always think he’s United’s Steven Gerrard but is he in fact our Coutinho?",

They have stated repeatedly from the beginning in 2010 that they would operate the club within its own means, and that they would always reinvest any money generated by the club into itself. They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",
      "FSG does not reinvest the club’s money into itself each and every year, though; the money is sometimes rolled over to future windows, and this upsets a lot of fans. These fans have either missed the fact that LFC has won two league titles in 35 years and both came in seasons when the club did basically nothing in the transfer window, or they simply care more about transfers than they do about effective football club management, who knows.",
      "It was always a mistake to interpret FSG’s general fiscal conservatism as a lack of ambition from club management/ownership, or as a sign of greed/them taking money out of the club. But it is also a mistake to interpret FSG loosening the purse strings for opportunistic luxury purchases like Suarez/Allison/Caicedo/Wirtz as the start of an era of Scouse Galacticos, rather than exceptions to the rule/approach which has served LFC so well over the last 15 years and will hopefully continue to see us with a club that we can be wholly proud to support.\nOliver (sidenote: if City’s FFP/PSR charges are confirmed, we could have already been talking about an FSG-led LFC dynasty in English football) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland",

      "If they couldn’t deal with the pressure of the last few years, how is it going to be in this coming season – the 5th proper year of the Arteta project – where the expectations now shift from HOPING to EXPECTING to win a trophy? They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",

And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",
      "Please feel free to chuck this back in my face if Arsenal are 10 points clear at Christmas and Chelsea are looking like they fancy a return to Conference League football – but I’m confident that you’ll see a changing of the guard in London next season.\nAndy H, Swansea",

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 15:49, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to undergo a medical at Manchester United after the terms of his £62.5m release clause at Wolves were met.",
      "Manchester United and Wolves had been in contact to discuss the payment structure. United had originally wanted to pay the figure over five years, but will now meet Wolves' terms of three parts over two years.",

      "\"Wolves turned around and said you've got to read the contract, it's there in black and white - we signed a new contract with the player in January, these are the terms of the contract, if you want him, the £62.5m needs to be paid in three instalments over two years. United have gone back to Wolves and said they'll accept those terms.",

      "\"I think they will make other signings, but the signings really have to work because you speak to a lot of people in football and they will tell you Manchester United's recruitment has just not been good enough.\""

      "Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing and upsetting; Antony has been on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United since January; Brazilian winger faces Chelsea on Wednesday in the Conference League final;",
      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
