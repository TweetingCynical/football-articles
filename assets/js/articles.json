      "Rasmus Hojlund has insisted that he is fully focused on Manchester United amid reports he could leave for Inter Milan this summer. Like many United players, Hojlund endured a poor 2024/25 campaign and his place in Ruben Amorim’s side is under threat.",
      "United have made it clear that they will listen to offers for any of their players in the summer transfer window and Hojlund has been linked with a £40million move to Inter. He managed just 10 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions for United last season, taking his tally to 26 in 95 games altogether.",
      "The club are bolstering their underperforming front line this summer by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, while they are also interested in Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo and Sporting Lisbon goal machine Viktor Gyokeres. Those deals would throw Hojlund’s place in the side into question and Inter have reportedly sensed an opportunity.",
      "It’s reported in Italy that the departures of Joaquin Correa and Marko Arnautovic from Inter could lead to a bid for Hojlund, who still has a good reputation in Italy thanks to his spell at Atalanta.",
      "It’s said that Inter are waiting for a new manager to be in place following Simone Inzaghi’s departure to join Al-Hilal before a decision is taken – but Hojliund has moved to pour cold water on the rumours.",
      "Speaking after playing in Denmark’s 2-1 win over Northern Ireland on Saturday night, he told TV 2 Sport: \"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",
      "\"I know I can't get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I'm just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.\"",
      "Hojlund joined United in a £72million transfer from Atalanta in August 2023 and has struggled to live up to his price tag. The 22-year-old has had little support from his team-mates in an underperforming side, with fellow youngster Joshua Zirkzee the other central striker on the books.",
      "United would be open to offers for Hojlund, given their interest in signing big-money attackers for Amorim. The Dane was also referenced by owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe when discussing the kinds of deals his INEOS group would not sanction.",
      "“If you look at the players we are buying, that we didn’t buy, we’re buying Antony, we’re buying Casemiro, we’re buying [Andre] Onana, we’re buying Hojlund, we’re buying [Jadon] Sancho,” Ratcliffe told BBC Sport. “These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we’ve inherited those things and have to sort that out.”",

      "Louis van Gaal has made a cutting remark on Manchester United, labelling the side a 'commercial club, not a football club'. The Dutch coach believes the Red Devils need too empower manager Ruben Amorim if they hope to be able to replicate the success of Liverpool under Arne Slot.",
      "Van Gaal was in the Old Trafford hot seat for two seasons from 2014 until 2016 and won the FA Cup in his second term in charge. The 73-year-old was left surprised by the team's inability to land first choice options despite its commercial wealth.",
      "United's ability in the transfer market has long been called into question with accusations of overpaying for players who have not been good enough. The 13-times Premier League champions have seen few outright wins in their incoming business with the exception of Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony have failed to set the Theatre of Dreams alight in recent seasons, but issues stretch back further than that in the mind of Van Gaal.",
      "\"I have said that before and that’s always difficult. When the manager is not deciding which players have to come in, it is very difficult.\"",
      "\"I think that it is is the way that it should be,\" he added. \"Because then you can fire a manager because he doesn’t give any results. But when other people buy the players, then you have a problem.",
      "\"You need to have the knowledge of the manager, the orientation of the manager, because he has to train them.\"",
      "And, really sticking the boot in, Van Gaal pointed to Premier League rivals Liverpool as a team United should replicate. The ex-Bayern Munich boss reckons Reds head coach has a pivotal role in Liverpool's transfer business, despite adding just one player to his squad last summer.",
      "\"Arne Slot is the man who says to his technical manager that he has to buy this player, pay attention to it,\" Van Gaal commented.",
      "The Dutchman has long been criticial of his former team's transfer approach. Van Gaal claimed that he did not receive the players he asked for during his time at the club, and the side's transfer business was held to ransom.",
      "\"Manchester United did not have the qualities to become champions and had an outdated selection with 10 players over 30, five over 35,\" he told Voetbal International in 2020. \"So I told them I was going to rejuvenate and which players should come. I didn't get one of those.",
      "\"Then you end up in a different segment and as a coach you have to push your boundaries. You don't expect that at the richest club in the world.",
      "\"A turnover of £600m and can't buy the players you need. You should buy number one and not number seven. Of course, the selling club also thinks: 'If you are so rich, you also have to pay the highest amount imaginable for a player.' That was what happened with transfers.",
      "\"Then you have to do with the numbers seven or eight on your wish list. For which you actually pay way too much money, on which the coach is judged and convicted.\"",

      "Now Frank, who has been able to aid Mbueumo's development from a Championship player to a 20-goal top flight star, wants the 25-year-old to follow him across London and has made that demand known to Tottenham.",
      "Even given the state of affairs at Old Trafford, players choosing Tottenham over Manchester has been rare. One man who did though was Gareth Bale when he chose to leave Southampton as a youngster. Both teams were keen on the Welshman, who would go on and become a global star.",
      "Bale later admitted a desire to play every week was a motive in him knocking back United, who were then the dominant force in England.",
      "He said on his Airwayz channel in 2023: \"I rejected Manchester United and went to Tottenham. At that time, United were the biggest team in the league, they were winning trophies, they had the biggest players, the best manager. The easiest decision would be to go to Man United and the biggest club. You always want to be at the biggest clubs but I took the approach that I wanted to be playing first-team football.\"",
      "Mbeumo is likely to be a starter whether he joins Tottenham or United, but Frank may lean on the fact that the north Londoners can offer Champions League football following their Europa League triumph.",
      "Frank has admitted that Mbeumo was likely to move on given the interest in him and Brentford's record of selling for big profits. “It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,” he said. “It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Tottenham have yet to make any major signings this summer and there is talk of Son Heung-min leaving the club after a decade of service. United meanwhile have already spent £62.5m to land Matheus Cunha from Wolves but bringing in more firepower is a priority.",

      "Despite traditionally hailing Peter Schmeichel as the top-flight's finest keeper, Neville had to pivot to Liverpool's current number one Alisson to adhere to the no-United rule.",
      "His defence also included Liverpool's commanding leader Virgil van Dijk, which surprisingly drew jeers from the audience, prompting Neville to clarify: \"I don't think they heard that I can't pick United players!\"",
      "Neville's defensive lineup was bolstered by Chelsea stalwarts with Cesar Azpilicueta and Ashley Cole taking the full-back spots, while his former England colleague John Terry was chosen to pair up with Van Dijk at centre-back.",

      "Manchester United’s transfer strategy wouldn’t sit well with Jose Mourinho, judging by previous comments from the former Old Trafford boss. It’s clear for all to see that Ruben Amorim’s squad needs a major overhaul following a desperate season, which culminated in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United have already landed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, while talks are ongoing with Brentford about signing Bryan Mbeumo. Despite a savage round of cost-cutting off the pitch, United could spend big on it, having also been linked with Sporting CP striker Victor Gyokeres and Aston Villa keeper Emi Martinez, among numerous other players.",
      "United are looking to repair the damage done by a succession of expensive mistakes in the transfer market, with Amorim happy to move on the likes of Jadon Sancho, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana if possible and replace them with new blood.",
      "It’s an approach not dissimilar to the one employed by Pep Guardiola at Manchester City while Mourinho was in charge of United. Mourinho took a shot at Guardiola after City spent more than £200million on defenders in the summer of 2017 as part of a wider spending spree at the Etihad.",
      "United spent big too that summer, almost £150m, but Mourinho insisted they couldn’t compete with City’s perceived ability to replace one expensive signing with another. He told United's website at the time: \"You think the club can put here now £600million and let's buy six players of £100m? The club cannot do that.",
      "\"I cannot expect the club to do that, so it's not critical and you can see how the market is, especially with the top teams. But, you know, without taking any credit away from Manchester City and Pep and his staff and the players, they obviously have lots of credit in what they are doing.",
      "“But Pep arrives, he has the goalkeeper of England (Joe Hart), he doesn't like him so he buys the goalkeeper of Barcelona (Claudio Bravo), he doesn't like him so he buys another one (Ederson). Now he likes.",
      "\"He has [Pablo] Zabaleta and [Aleksandar] Kolarov - two very good players but more than 30 years old. He wants to replace, he doesn't replace with two, he replaces with three.",
      "\"One from Tottenham (Kyle Walker), one from Monaco (Benjamin Mendy) and one from Real Madrid (Danilo) as an example. Can we buy six or seven players at the same time? Can we invest £600-700m? No. So, it's difficult.",
      "\"I think the last years, the market is going in such a direction or you belong to one of these clubs where there is no limit and you just buy what you want and there is no limit, there is no financial fair play, there is nothing, you do what you want - or it's hard.\"",
      "Now, clubs are bound by financial restrictions, which means expensive signings are generally coupled with sales. That is sure to be the case at United this summer. Still, it’s unlikely Mourinho, whose win ratio was only marginally lower than Sir Alex Ferguson’s when he was sacked in December 2018, would approve of United’s current transfer strategy."

Despite his future in Florence being unclear he's not sold on the idea of heading to United after proving himself with 25 goals last term.

Tuttomercatoweb claim that United are the team who have consistently shown an interest in Kean.",

      "It means a move for Viktor Gyokeres could be back on. The Sporting Lisbon frontman had been linked with a Manchester move given his connection with Amorim but looked to be apprehensive after they missed out on the Champions League.",
      "That stance appears to have softened and the Swede would be open to the move. He is likely to cost £60m, which is less than his release clause. Gyokeres has proved that he can regularly supply goals and his signing would be a major coup for the Red Devils.",

      "Jadon Sancho's goal in the Europa Conference League final was not enough to convince Chelsea he was worth £25million plus his not inconsiderable salary. Despite ending his time at Stamford Bridge with a European trophy, the 25-year-old was sent back to Manchester United by Enzo Maresca's side.",
      "When the Blues loaned Sancho from the Red Devils last summer, they did so on the premise that they would pay £25m to sign him permanently at the end of the campaign. When the deal was made, the only way Chelsea could renege on that deal was if they finished lower than 14th, or pay a £5m penalty clause to get out of the deal.",
      "After finishing fourth and winning the Conference League, Chelsea opted to pay the £5m to send Sancho back from whence he came. Now the Blues have been linked with other wide midfielders such as Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao and, ironically, Sancho's United team-mate Alejandro Garnacho, who has seemingly been banished by Ruben Amorim in the same way as Sancho was by Erik ten Hag.",
      "After the Conference League triumph, Maresca appeared to state that he wanted the winger to remain at Stamford Bridge. He said: \"We are going to sit with the club and decide what happens for next year.",
      "\"He's come here and got his career back on track. I still think there is more to come from him; I really do.\"",
      "Chelsea backed out of the deal, as Sancho would not compromise on the £300,000 per-week salary he earns at United. Such a wage would see Sancho earn more than £250k-a-week Chelsea captain Reece James (£250,000 per-week) and more than twice as much as midfield talisman Cole Palmer, who is understood to be on around £130,000 per-week.",
      "When Sancho's exit was confirmed, the former England international took to social media and wrote: \"Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home - teammates, staff and the fans. Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful.\"",
      "As long as Sancho insists on his £300,000 per-week salary, potential suitors will likely be hard to come by. United's £62.5m capture of Matheus Cunha and the potential £55m arrival of Bryan Mbeumo pushes Sancho even further down the pecking order.",
      "In May, Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen were reportedly willing to make an offer to United for Sancho. Unfortunately for the ex-Borussia Dortmund ace, Ten Hag's arrival will surely all but block any route to the BayArena.",
      "Sancho's contract at Old Trafford expires June 30 2026. This summer represents United's best opportunity to cash in on his services, even though there is next to no chance that they will recoup the £73m they paid to Dortmund in the summer of 2021.",
      "If a permanent move maintaining his salary is not possible this year, Sancho's next best option could be another loan spell, having already spent six months at Dortmund and a year at Stamford Bridge.",
      "However, with United looking to bolster their forward line, they will surely prefer a permanent transfer which guarantees them a fee and gets rid of Sancho from their wage-bill. It's another difficult situation for the ex-Manchester City academy star, who was tipped for great things when he first started catching the eye at Dortmund as a teenager, but whose career arguably hasn't reached the heights that many thought it would.",

      "Lisandro Martinez is making good progress in his recovery from a serious knee injury and Manchester United are hopeful he could be available early next season. Martinez needed surgery in February after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Crystal Palace, but he’s now on the road to recovery.",
      "The United defender was carried from the pitch in tears after sustaining the serious injury which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Martinez was a big miss for Ruben Amorim in the final three months of the campaign, as United limped to 15th place in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "He was one of many injuries in defence for United and won’t be able to take a full part in pre-season when that comes around. However, the club have been encouraged by the progress the Argentina international has made, with tests confirming last week that he hasn’t got a tear in his meniscus.",
      "United are weary of rushing him back and will take a cautious approach to avoid aggravating the injury. But it is hoped he will be able to start an individual rehabilitation programme in the coming months, working individually on the grass during pre-season.",
      "The aim will be for Martinez to make his return as soon as possible in the 2025/26 season, when United’s team will look very different. Amorim is keen to overhaul his squad – and the club will listen to offers for any of their players – but the United boss is a fan of Martinez.",
      "\"If you let him, he can go play today without problem,\" Amorim said in March after Martinez was spotted cheering his team-mates on from the sidelines against Arsenal. \"Because he loves the club, he wants to help the team, he understands the context. Like I said, he's a great character, he's really important in the dressing room.\"",
      "The 27-year-old has also been praised for his leadership and encouragement by young midfielder Toby Collyer, who told the club website: “Licha is another name that’s massively helped me, in training every day, around the building, to express myself, giving me little tips on the pitch and helping me through games. He’s another one that’s really helped me.”",
      "Collyer also struggled with injuries, so spent lots of time with Martinez. “We saw each other every day in the physio room,” he added. “And even when we’re working in the gym, you have little moments where you can chat for a bit. It’s nice to have someone like him to get through it with.”",
      "Martinez is keen to return as soon as possible. After undergoing surgery he wrote on Instagram : \"Today, after going through several stormy days where I allowed myself to feel and accept my sadness, helplessness, insecurities, fears, and a deep emotional imbalance, I am reconnecting with my essence and my values, which help me see things from a kinder and more positive perspective.",
      "\"I feel immense gratitude for the incredible work and support of @manchesterunited, @afaseleccion, my family, friends, teammates, and everyone who took the time to send me a message of encouragement. The surgery went perfectly!! Now it’s time to give it my all, with heart and soul, in the rehabilitation process.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a serious problem after Chelsea refused to sign Jadon Sancho permanently, because he has no intention of ever playing for the club again. Sancho had appeared set to join the Blues permanently after spending the season on loan in west London, only for negotiations to break down.",
      "Chelsea ultimately decided they would rather pay United a £5million fee than go through with signing the winger for £25m. Sancho is paid around £300,000 per week by United and he and Chelsea had been unable to find a compromise on his wages, forcing a rethink for all parties.",
      "United are desperate to sell off their unwanted players in the summer transfer window, in order to help fund a rebuild under Ruben Amorim. Sancho had appeared to be the most straightforward deal, with Chelsea lumbered with an obligation to buy the 25-year-old, only for the move to break down.",
      "He has now joined the list of other unwanted players United must find buyers for, which also includes fellow loanees Marcus Rashford and Antony, and wantaway winger Alejandro Garnacho. Keeping Sancho for the 2025/26 campaign under Amorim is not a viable option, with ESPN reporting that he has no intention of pulling the United shirt on again.",
      "His stance matches that of Amorim, who doesn’t want him in his squad when the next season begins. Sancho returned five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea, helping them win the Conference League – a solid if unspectacular effort which won’t help their efforts to sell him.",
      "The report states that there is tentative interest from West Ham, although Sancho’s wages will be problematic. He has another year left on his contract with United, who are reluctant to buy out the winger in order to grease the wheels of his exit.",
      "Sancho has been a flop of significant proportions since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m. He has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United over four years and has not come close to matching the potential shown at Dortmund.",
      "He was absolutely electric in Germany, where he managed 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund, but has struggled to replicate that form in England. A potential move back to the Bundesliga was potentially on the cards with Bayer Leverkusen, until the club hired Erik ten Hag as manager to shut that door.",
      "Ten Hag fell out with Sancho over his apparent lack of effort in training at Carrington and it was the Dutchman who prompted his loan move back to Dortmund in January 2024.",

It also sees the moment where Amorim preferred to arrive at Old Trafford before being told he had to join United in January.",
      "The first transfer window of the summer is open until June 10, before the market once again becomes available to work in from June 16. United have already announced the arrival of Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal, but there remains plenty of work to do.",

Antony meanwhile enjoyed a promising loan at Real Betis, while Garnacho has been told to find a new club amid an end of season dispute.",
      "If deals are not sealed in time for United's trip to the United States, it puts Amorim and the club in the difficult position of deciding how to integrate such players. Taking those stars on tour risks disruption to Amorim's preparations, while leaving them out could see their values drop quickly.",

      "The Reds have made a solid start to the off-season, signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million deal and setting their sights on Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. United have seen an opening offer worth £55m knocked back for the Cameroonian but they are expected to go back in with a revised bid.",
      "Transforming the landscape of their attack has to be a leading priority for United this summer, meaning both incomings and outgoings are expected. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United should be striving to complete over the next 12 weeks:",
      "With Cunha already through the door, Mbeumo is widely expected to be United's second new arrival of the summer.",
      "Although they are yet to agree a fee with Brentford for the 25-year-old, who plundered 20 Premier League goals this season, Mbeumo's desire to move to Old Trafford means there is an expectation a deal will get completed in the not too distant future.",
      "The former Troyes man, who is understood to be valued at a similar price to the fee United paid for Cunha, has made it clear he wants to move to Old Trafford and strengthen Ruben Amorim's attack. The expectation is that he would occupy the right-sided No.10 role.",
      "If United successfully add Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha, the missing piece in their attacking jigsaw will be a striker. Signing a centre-forward has to be United's main focus this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "After missing out on top target Liam Delap to Chelsea, it remains to be seen in which direction United's search for a goal-getter will head in. However, links connecting the Reds with Sporting Lisbon goal machine Viktor Gyokeres have not gone away, and he remains increasingly likely to leave the Portuguese capital this summer.",
      "No stranger to Amorim after working together at Sporting, it is widely reported the Swede will be available for somewhere in the region of £60m this summer. With Chelsea having signed Delap, Arsenal chasing Benjamin Sesko's tail and Victor Osimhen still being linked with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, United could find themselves in with a chance of having a clear run at the former Coventry City man.",
      "He has scored a whopping 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, meaning he is one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. Of those 97 goals, 54 were scored this season, meaning he would be a shoo-in to lead United's attack.",
      "Despite United's eagerness to get on the front foot with their recruitment this summer, it is still almost certain there will be more outgoings than incomings at Old Trafford between now and the September 1 deadline.",
      "United are planning for at least ten departures and several are expected to be from the attacking department. After allowing Marcus Rashford and Antony to head out on loan in January, the Reds now hope to offload them permanently.",
      "Alongside Jadon Sancho, Rashford and Antony have been identified as players United want to sell as a priority. Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available for around £32.5m and Sancho could attract a fee of around £25m after Chelsea pulled out of the obligation they were originally set to meet to sign him permanently.",
      "No member of that particular trio has a future at Old Trafford in a winger-less system, meaning it would be in everyone's best interests to go their separate ways this summer. Antony has created a market for himself after impressing out on loan at Real Betis, scoring nine goals and registering five assists, while Barcelona have declared their interest in Rashford.",
      "United also plan to offload Alejandro Garnacho after Amorim informed him that he is free to leave the club this summer. He was benched for the Europa League final and left out of the squad for United's final Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa.",
      "Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for Garnacho in January and United are expected to hold out for a higher fee. They could demand north of £50m for him.",
      "Elsewhere, Rasmus Hojlund is attracting interest from Inter Milan and United should attempt to offload him if an acceptable offer comes their way. The Dane regressed in his second season at Old Trafford, scoring just ten goals, and patience with him is wearing thin.",
      "United need to raise as much money as possible this summer via player sales to fund new additions, meaning getting Hojlund off the books could increase their chances of securing a replacement and potentially strengthen other areas of the squad.",

      "He has reported that Werder Bremen, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht, Club Brugge and two unnamed Championship clubs have all expressed interest in his signature after a promising debut season in Poland.",
      "It has been reported that Oyedele, 20, 'will leave' Legia this summer and is available via a release clause worth €6million (£5.05m at the current exchange rate). The defensive-midfielder made 24 appearances in his debut season at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time.",
      "News of reported interest in his signature from elsewhere will be of interest to United. As a result of becoming more proactive in the seller's market last summer, the Reds inserted various clauses into a collection of outgoing deals, including the one that saw Oyedele move to Poland.",
      "According to Romano, the sell-on clause means United will inherit 40 per cent of the fee Legia bank from any potential sale of the midfielder. It means United, who were probably not anticipating Oyedele would develop at the speed he has, could bank just north of £2m.",
      "Oyedele, as proven with the current level of interest being expressed in his signature, enjoyed a strong first season in Poland. His achievements included making his debut for the national team at senior level and making five appearances in the Europa Conference League, including two quarter-final starts against Chelsea.",
      "As a result of United's smart thinking, any funds they bank via sell-on clauses they included in deals from previous windows will go towards assisting their efforts in the quest to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United's cross-city neighbours, Manchester City, have often been the masters of such scenarios in previous years, regularly offloading young talent with sell-on clauses attached to any future moves so they can receive money on the back of any future success.",
      "United also included a buy-back option in the deal that saw Oyedele move to Legia, meaning they covered all bases. Sell-on clauses were also included in other deals United completed last summer."

      "After triggering his release clause, United confirmed the arrival of Cunha last Sunday subject to him obtaining a visa and registration. Just over 24 hours later, it emerged that Mbeumo has his sights set on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United tabled an offer for him, understood to be worth £55m, but it was swiftly rejected by Brentford. However, talks remain ongoing and United are expected to lodge an improved bid.",
      "The Bees are understood to be holding out for a similar fee to the £62.5m United paid Wolves for Cunha, although the Brazilian's exit from Molineux was much easier to manufacture because of his release clause.",
      "Nevertheless, United are confident they will be able to lure Mbeumo to M16 amid his desire to make the switch. He has also been the subject of interest from Arsenal and Newcastle United.",
      "The deal for Mbeumo is understood to be the only one United are actively working on despite needing to strengthen other areas of their squad this summer. A goalkeeper and a midfielder are understood to be high up on their wish list.",
      "But ahead of Tuesday evening's deadline, United are currently unlikely to add to the addition of Cunha. They are yet to agree a fee with Brentford for Mbeumo and it is unlikely they will get everything signed, sealed and delivered ahead of the cut-off point.",
      "As far as outgoings are concerned, United have a list of players they would like to offload this summer, including Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony. However, they are yet to have been in recipient of bids for any of them.",
      "Elsewhere, Inter Milan have confirmed their interest in Rasmus Hojlund, who could be sold this summer, but official talks are yet to take place.",
      "It means barring for any unexpected developments at a rapid turn of speed, no incomings or outgoings are expected at Old Trafford ahead of the mid-window deadline.",
      "Looking a little further ahead, if talks with Brentford and Mbeumo progress in the way United hope they will, he should become their second signing of the summer. However, any further additions beyond him are expected to be funded by outgoings, meaning United's focus will soon have to switch to matters in the seller's market."

      "Despite the Dane suggesting he has another five years still to run on his current contract, he signed a five-year deal at Old Trafford in August 2023, meaning his current deal is due to expire in June 2028, with the option of a further year to potentially take him through to the summer of 2029.",

The need for significant improvement is clear after a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League and underwhelming performances in both domestic and European cup competitions.",

Brentford boss Frank is now the leading contender to replace him and appears eager to bring one of his key players with him to north London.",
      "The report also notes that the Bees are open to offers and United remain in active negotiations, determined to get a deal over the line. Mbeumo has long been admired at Old Trafford, and it's believed the coaching staff view him as a strong fit for Amorim’s system and style of play.",
      "United’s pursuit has intensified following encouraging signs from the player’s camp that he is keen on a move to the North West. The Athletic were first to report that Mbeumo has made United his preferred destination, despite attracting interest from elsewhere in the Premier League.",

      "It's about time United worked smart in the market. A glance at some of their biggest arrivals in recent memory includes the likes of Paul Pogba, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Romelu Lukaku, Angel Di Maria and Casemiro. None of that £500+million sextet could be considered a success. And that is just picking from players who cost more than £60million.",
      "So it's not difficult to see where United have been going wrong. And it's not too hard to see how things could be put right.",
      "In the same timeframe that United have been wasteful, a host of top players have departed the Bundesliga for big bucks. Many of them were snapped up by German clubs at a fraction of their sale prices, attracted by the lure of regular football and the opportunity to impress.",
      "Jude Bellingham, who United courted, is the most obvious example although he might be something of a one-off case given he had his pick of clubs across Europe. But if United's recent recruitment track record had been a bit better and the club a bit more stable, then the England international could perhaps have been swayed.",
      "But the likes of Ballon d'or favourite Ousmane Dembele, one-time United target Randal Kolo Muani and Premier League success stories Josko Gvardiol and Dominik Szoboszlai have all recently left sides in Germany for huge sums and huge profits.",

Those four cost a combined €74million when they moved to Germany, they were sold for €385million.",

      "One defensive player who is certainly not part of the fold at Old Trafford is Tyrell Malacia who had an underwhelming loan spell at PSV in the second half of last season and is down the pecking order."

      "Less than a week after opening, the summer transfer window will temporarily close again as soon as Tuesday evening.",
      "As a result of the new Club World Cup format, the window opened earlier than usual to allow clubs participating in the tournament an exceptional registration period. The temporary closure, however, will last less than a week, with the window reopening on Monday, June 16.",
      "However, it does mean there will be a brief pause in transfer activity. For Manchester United, it means time is running out to get any more business done before the temporary halt in proceedings.",
      "United have come flying out of the traps at the start of this window, securing the services of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last Sunday, before setting their sights on Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had an opening offer of £45million with a further £10m in add-ons knocked back in midweek after it fell short of Brentford's valuation. It is understood talks remain ongoing and a fresh offer is expected.",
      "On the presumption United get a deal over the line for Mbeumo, focus must then shift to outgoings. Mbeumo is likely to cost the Reds somewhere in the region of £60m, meaning their summer spending will smash through the £120m barrier after just two signings, with Cunha setting United back by £62.5m.",
      "United still need to strengthen a handful of other areas within their squad this summer, including in goal, in midfield and up front. A striker has to be the main priority.",
      "Regardless of what happens in terms of incomings, United always planned to be active in the seller's market - and that stance has not changed. They want to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priorities, while fellow wide man Alejandro Garnacho has also been told he can move on at the right price.",
      "United are understood to have valued at Rashford at £40m and they want around £32.5m for Antony, whose stock has risen in recent months thanks to his productive loan spell at Real Betis.",
      "United must find an alternative avenue in their quest to offload Sancho after Chelsea backed out of the obligation to sign the winger in a £25m deal. Chelsea paid a £5m penalty fee to break that agreement, but it means United now have the challenge of trying to find an alternative buyer.",
      "Sancho's wages are expected to be the biggest stumbling block in United's attempt to shift him, but they will still be keen to bank a fee in the region of the £25m Chelsea were originally expected to pay. If United are successful in their efforts to offload him, Rashford and Antony for the valuations they have set, they could secure almost £100m, which would be an excellent return for three players they have no plans to keep.",
      "United turned down a £40m bid for Garnacho from Napoli in January and will understandably want a higher fee this summer. Somewhere between £50m and £60m feels like a fair market value for the talented Argentine.",
      "If United can secure a fee within that region, they could find themselves securing a windfall in the region of £150m from just four sales. It is not as easy as simply ploughing the money straight back into the squad, with other operational costs and the £89m owed in transfer fees from previous windows to be considered, but it will give them a helping hand in their quest to recruit players for other positions in need of attention.",
      "As well as wanting to offload Rashford, Sancho, Garnacho and Antony, other departures are expected from Old Trafford. Tyrell Malacia is expected to leave permanently after three seasons at the club, Rasmus Hojlund is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and Casemiro is not assured of his future after United failed to qualify for Europe.",
      "Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir could also be sold amid Ruben Amorim's eagerness to recruit a new goalkeeper, while Luke Shaw is another player United should be looking to try and offload, though his injury record may put suitors off.",
      "The transfer market is one of the most unpredictable elements in football, meaning not everything United hope to achieve between now and the start of September will come to fruition. However, their intentions cannot be criticised.",
      "If they successfully offload the nine aforementioned players, particularly the star-studded names on the list, it will give them the best possible chance of making the additions they want."

      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha last weekend, Manchester United have now set their sights on securing the signature of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down earlier this week, United are understood to remain in discussions with Brentford and an improved offer is expected to be submitted.",
      "The Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals this season, wants to move to Old Trafford despite being linked with the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United, both of who have qualified for next season's Champions League.",
      "The prospect of United adding Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha will significantly strengthen their attacking options. Between them, the pair have scored 56 Premier League goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Mbeumo would also provide United with a versatile profile. With that said, MEN Sport has looked at three ways the Reds could line up if they secure the 25-year-old's signature:",
      "The general consensus is that United are chasing Mbeumo's signature with the idea of deploying him as the right-sided No.10 in Ruben Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 formation. He has played predominantly as a right-winger throughout his time at Brentford, but he often drifts inside to take up threatening positions.",
      "Amid that trait and his goalscoring record, he is a suitable fit for the right-sided No.10 role. He is also left-footed, and Amorim has gone on record he saying he prefers a left-footed player operating in that position.",
      "Should Mbeumo sign and be deployed on the right of the attack, Amad will almost certainly start from right wing-back. As far as the attack is concerned, Cunha is expected to be a shoo-in as the left-sided No.10, meaning the central position should be filled by the addition of a new striker.",
      "United are yet to confirm in which direction their hunt for a striker will head in after missing out on Liam Delap, but they continue to be linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres. Amorim knows him inside out and he would be a dream signing.",
      "It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mbeumo could play through the middle and spearhead United's attack. According to data specialists Transfermarkt, he played six times as a centre-forward for Brentford in 2024/25, scoring four goals.",
      "His reliability in front of goal, reflected in his tally of 38 Premier League strikes over the last three seasons, proves he is capable of playing up front. United have needed a multi-functional forward for several seasons and Mbeumo ticks that particular box.",
      "If United found themselves needing to deploy Mbeumo up front, they would not be light on options to fill the right-sided No.10 position with the likes of Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad all capable of playing in that role.",
      "In games United are expected to dominate and dictate, Amorim may find himself feeling tempted to cram as many attack-minded players onto the pitch as possible, and could task Mbeumo with operating from right wing-back.",
      "Praised by Brentford boss Thomas Frank for his attitude and application and approach to defending, Mbeumo is unlikely to shy away from tracking back and contributing defensively. He is renowned for his commitment and willingness to give everything for the cause.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo operating out wide would allow Amad to play further forward and occupy the right-sided No.10 position. The Ivorian has flexed his muscles as both a wing-back and a No.10 since Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "If Amorim was sticking with the plan of trying to unleash as many attack-minded players as possible, and United do not sign the striker they crave, Cunha could be tasked with leading the line in this particular instance, such is his versatility, and Fernandes could play higher up the pitch."

      "Jose Mourinho wouldn't approve of Manchester United's current transfer strategy if the former Old Trafford boss' previous comments are anything to go by.",
      "It's evident that Ruben Amorim's squad requires a significant revamp after a spirit-crushing season, which suffered one last brutal blow with a loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final. United have already secured Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are in discussions with Brentford about acquiring Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite severe cost-cutting measures off the pitch, United could still make substantial investments on it, having been linked with Sporting CP forward Victor Gyokeres and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, among numerous others.",
      "United are aiming to rectify the damage caused by a series of costly errors in the transfer market. If the right offers come in, the futures of players such as Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee, and Andre Onana could potentially lie away from the club.",
      "This strategy could be compared to the one Pep Guardiola used at Manchester City during Mourinho's tenure at United. Mourinho criticised Guardiola after City spent over £200million on defenders in the summer of 2017 as part of a broader spending spree at the Etihad.",
      "United splurged almost £150m during that summer window, yet Mourinho maintained that they were outgunned by City's capability to keep refreshing their squad with high-priced talents. Speaking to United's website, he said at the time: \"You think the club can put here now £600million and let's buy six players of £100m? The club cannot do that.",
      "\"I cannot expect the club to do that, so it's not critical and you can see how the market is, especially with the top teams. But, you know, without taking any credit away from Manchester City and Pep and his staff and the players, they obviously have lots of credit in what they are doing.",
      "\"But Pep arrives, he has the goalkeeper of England (Joe Hart), he doesn't like him so he buys the goalkeeper of Barcelona (Claudio Bravo), he doesn't like him so he buys another one (Ederson). Now he likes.",
      "\"He has [Pablo] Zabaleta and [Aleksandar] Kolarov - two very good players but more than 30 years old. He wants to replace, he doesn't replace with two, he replaces with three.",
      "\"One from Tottenham (Kyle Walker), one from Monaco (Benjamin Mendy) and one from Real Madrid (Danilo) as an example. Can we buy six or seven players at the same time? Can we invest £600-700m? No. So, it's difficult.",
      "\"I think the last years, the market is going in such a direction or you belong to one of these clubs where there is no limit and you just buy what you want and there is no limit, there is no financial fair play, there is nothing, you do what you want - or it's hard.\"",
      "Nowadays, clubs are constrained by financial limitations, which typically means that high-cost signings are paired with player sales. This is expected to be the case at United this summer. However, it's doubtful that Mourinho, now in charge of Turkish giants Fenerbahce, would endorse United's current transfer approach of replacing expensive signings with yet more expensive signings."

      "Those two signings would be a statement of intent so early in the summer and provide Ruben Amorim with a pair of proven Premier League players who can bring creativity, goals and versatility.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 top flight goals between them last season and seem natural fits for the two number 10 positions in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 shape. The United chief made it clear last season that he wouldn't be switching systems and this summer offers the Reds a chance to recruit to suit.",
      "The arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo will have a knock on effect elsewhere in the squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes could retreat to a central midfielder rather than operating in an advanced role. The Portugal international increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed and has the capabilities to be a success in a dictating role.",
      "Amad would also seemingly lose his spot as a number 10 despite an impressive campaign last term. But the Ivory Coast international is capable of playing as a right wing back in Amorim's system while slotting in further forward should the need arise.",
      "The 22-year-old has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "Diogo Dalot would be the natural competition for Amad and if the latter does amend his position then it frees Noussair Mazraoui up to be a centre back option. The 27-year-old played a number of positions during his debut campaign at Old Trafford but he does not offer the attacking input needed for a wing back role and slotting in as one of the back three would make the most sense.",
      "United are unlikely to cap their business at the arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo with a striker also on the shortlist. A move for Liam Delap failed after the 22-year-old opted to choose Chelsea but the Reds are likely to explore alternatives in the summer, albeit they will likely need to sell before they strengthen further.",
      "The addition of a centre forward would be bad news for Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled in his second campaign at United. The Dane, who is attracting interest from Inter Milan, had shown promise and potential in his debut season but regressed amid the pressure of leading the line.",
      "Still only 22, Hojlund could benefit from a more reduced role next term while offering industry and energy off the bench. He could become something of an impact player, called upon when attacking resources are required to offer another forward option. It's not what Hojlund will want, but it might be just what he needs."

      "United have submitted their second offer for the forward, with reports claiming it could be their final offer to Brentford. After seeing their initial bid of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons rejected, United have now upped their offer.",
      "The Mirror reports that the second offer is £55 million, plus £5 million in bonuses. It is still to be seen if Brentford will accept or reject the bid, with the Bees’ valuation of the player starting at £60 million.",
      "The report also says that personal terms over a five-year deal with wages around £200,000 per-week has already been agreed with the player.",
      "United may be keeping a close eye on what is going on at Tottenham Hotspur over the next few days, with it potentially impacting the transfer of Mbeumo.",
      "Spurs announced on Friday that they had parted ways with head coach Ange Postecoglou. Brentford boss Thomas Frank has quickly been instilled as favourite to take over.",
      "The uncertainty at Brentford may cause them to delay a decision over Mbeumbo, and any compensation that they potentially get for Frank could mean they rise the price for Mbeumo.",
      "There is then, of course, the threat that Frank makes a move of his own for the player if he is appointed at Tottenham. Spurs will be playing Champions League football next season after their Europa League win, and the player and manager know each other well.",
      "It’s a situation that will be watched very closely.",
      "It has been claimed that Mbeumo has told United in talks with the club that he wants £250,000 per week if he joins the club this summer.",
      "According to the Times, the Brentford man currently earns £50,000 per week at the Gtech Community Stadium, but wants that to increase fivefold upon any move to Old Trafford. If United agree then he would immediately become one of the club’s top earners."

I loved Tommy T’s touchline and post match “WTF lads?”, but if you’re gonna pick the geriatric money grubbing water carrier, and start Kane in games like this, then my patience has already run out.

      "What I’ll not have is this irrational bashing of a player based on perception rather than reality. The reality is, over the last 5 seasons he is not just the outright greatest chance creator in all of Europe (source: statmuse) he leads second place by almost 30% more chances. He is 13th in goals + assists and is the only non striker/winger in the top 25. No one in Europe is more productive than Bruno at creating chances.",
      "Even in a season without a striker worthy of the title in a fully dysfunctional United team when compared to midfielders he is in the 97-99th percentile in Shots, Assists, Exp Goals, Exp Assists and Shot Creating Actions. 98th in progressive passses. His defensive actions are far more in line with a decent central midfielder than one tasked with creating. He runs more than almost anyone else. He has more tackles and blocks than plenty of defensive midfielders.",

Spurs, on the other hand, hadn’t won anything is almost two decades; that Europa League win was far, far more impactful than United’s FA Cup and a far better justification for retaining Big Ange. In short,  ManU made the wrong call after the FA Cup, but it doesn’t follow that Spurs made the right one.",
      "I’m not positive that Spurs have made a mistake. That will depend on the replacement they secure and the reactions along the squad, some of which seem negative indeed. But it sure would have been interesting to watch Ange and Spurs next season. I’ll miss that weirdo.",
      "Also, I’m still troubled by the quiet transfer front at NUFC. I’d expected us to have at least Mbeumo wrapped up by now. And while the club is no doubt wise to protect its wage structure, he would’ve been prefect for us. 18 year-old Antonio Cordero looks promising, but isn’t yet a first-team contributor, and that transfer has probably been quietly agreed weeks or months ago. It’s already starting to feel like last summer.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "But here’s the thing – I don’t care.  We did win a major trophy, we are in the champions league, we do have a young squad that can compete with some sensible additions and a more tactically astute manager, and we avoided the ETH trap of keeping the wrong guy for (understandable) emotional reasons.  Sonny came out and said that Ange ‘changed the trajectory of the club’ and by winning something that may well be true, and he’ll always be remembered fondly but this really is the best of both worlds.",
      "Now of course Daniel Levy is fully capable of clutching defeat from the jaws of victory by signing a another bunch of 18 year olds, but if we buy a proper 6 and at least one top notch forward plus a couple of depth pieces this really is an attractive squad to work with over the next few years.  If I was Frank or Poch I’d jump at the chance.\nPhil, London",

      "Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy ‘could trump United’s bid with Champions League football’ with Mbeumo facing a ‘decision as to whether to follow his head or his heart’.",
      "After two bids for Mbeumo, Man Utd are yet to agree a deal with Brentford, ‘leaving the door open for Spurs to make their move’ after the Red Devils offered the Cameroon international ‘around £150,000-a-week with add-ons taking the package up to £200,000-a-week’.",
      "On Tottenham potentially taking the lead on Mbeumo, the Daily Mirror added: ‘Spurs would offer Mbeumo around £130,000-a-week and although bonuses would still leave them short of the United package, the north Londoners would still have the pull of Champions League football and Frank – who turned Mbeumo into one of the most feared forwards in the top flight.’",
      "Brentford have scored more goals than Man Utd and conceded fewer than Spurs since promotion to the Premier League; it’s why he may replace Ange Postecoglou.",
      "According to reports, two ‘major reasons’ were behind Tottenham Hotspur’s unsurprising decision to sack head coach Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Spurs have already been ‘rejected’ in their search for a new manager, and ‘everything suggests’ the cheaper of two Premier League bosses will be appointed.",
      "Tottenham are on the hunt of a new manager after the sacking of Ange Postecoglou and it’s been revealed that chairman Daniel Levy has met with his No 1 target ...",
      "Insider David Ornstein is among those who have confirmed that a Premier League boss is the ‘leading contender’ to success Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham.",

      "Man Utd are responsible for four of the most expensive signings ever of players between the ages of 13 and 36; they later released two of them.",
      "",
      "13 – Finley Burns (£250,000, Southend to Manchester City in January 2017)\nNow an ancient 21, Burns has done well to remain on the books of Manchester City since joining in his first teenage year in January 2017. The defender has even made his first-team debut in the League Cup, spent time on loan in the Championship and played for England age groups up to the U20s so far.",
      "",
      "14 – Sheyi Ojo (£2m, MK Dons to Liverpool in November 2011)\nAfter playing for the U18s and training with the first team, Ojo attracted intense interest from Chelsea and Liverpool but it was the latter who won out. He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",
      "",
      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",
      "",
      "20 – Ousmane Dembele (£135.5m, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona in August 2017)\nBarcelona were right to sense there was a ridiculously good player there; how unfortunate the potential has only been realised at PSG.",
      "",
      "21 – Moises Caicedo (£100m, Brighton to Chelsea in August 2023)\nBrighton did what Brighton do and held out long enough for Liverpool and Chelsea to walk into a blindfolded blinking contest, with Caicedo ultimately making the decision by turning down a British record £111m move to the former in favour of a potential £115m switch to the latter.",
      "",
      "22 – Enzo Fernandez (£106.8m, Benfica to Chelsea in February 2023)\nThe £10m move from River Plate to Benfica in June 2022 did not make Fernandez the most expensive 22-year-old footballer in history, but his next transfer a few months later as a world champion certainly did.",
      "",
      "23 – Paul Pogba (£93.8m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2016)\nLeft for free at 19. Moved for world-record fee at 23. Left to join previous club – again for free – at 29. And only once did Pogba achieve what Graeme Souness “expected” of him.",
      "",
      "24 – Declan Rice (£100m, West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023)\nArsenal will not mind if Rice enjoys similar success to the last individual who proudly held the title of world’s most expensive 24-year-old footballer. Gareth Bale did just fine and the Gunners believe their new record signing could be one of the many jigsaw pieces.",
      "",
      "25 – Neymar (£198m, Barcelona to PSG in August 2017)\nOh look, it’s the transfer that broke football.",
      "",
      "26 – Harry Maguire (£80m, Leicester to Man Utd in August 2019)\nNot only did Maguire usurp Virgil van Dijk as the most expensive defender ever, he replaced him as the most expensive 26-year-old in history. That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",
      "",
      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",
      "",
      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",
      "Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has demanded that the media stay out of the way of football’s most exciting young talent in order for him to build a career ...",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has issued a clear update on his potential participation in this month’s Club World Cup.",
      "Are you really a world-record holder if you have to lower yourself to counting goals scored against Scotland? Cristiano Ronaldo is an embarrassing fraud.",
      "Manchester City are heavily represented in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Matheus Cunha is in but No 1) will never be shifted.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly reached an ‘agreement’ with Al-Nassr to remain in Saudi Arabia and become the ‘main decision-maker’ in the transfer market.",
      "Liverpool will hope Florian Wirtz can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging."

      "Man Utd have been responsible for three of the 20 biggest signings ever involving defenders, while rejecting then buying another who is in the top ten twice.",
      "",
      "1) Harry Maguire – £80m/€97m (Leicester to Man Utd, August 2019)\nAfter vetoing a summer 2018 move for Maguire because of a reticence to pay a potential world-record fee for a defender, Man Utd paid a very much real world-record fee for a defender to sign the Leicester centre-half the following year. And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol – £77m/€89m (Leipzig to Manchester City, August 2023)\nA standout World Cup for Croatia and another season of Bundesliga excellence – although Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland tried their utmost to ruin both respectively – finally earned Gvardiol his long-awaited Premier League move for less than the original world-record demands.",
      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",
      "",
      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Cancelo – £60m/€65m (Juventus to Manchester City, August 2019)\nSwapping places with Danilo, Cancelo went from bit-part player to one of the best in the league, then suddenly a Bayern Munich and Barcelona loanee and Saudi import, all within five ludicrous years.",
      "",
      "11) Aymeric Laporte – £57m/€65m (Athletic Bilbao to Manchester City, January 2018)\nAfter Manchester City balked at the numbers involved in procuring Van Dijk from Southampton, they simply switched them around and went for Laporte in a club-record move instead. It went less well but still OK.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £55m/€68m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt doesn’t feel as though the add-ons potentially taking this deal to £63m were activated in a dreadful couple of years for Cucurella the individual and the Chelsea collective. European Championship glory with Spain sparked a turnaround at club level.",
      "",
      "13) Leny Yoro – £52.1m/€61.8m (Lille to Man Utd, July 2024)\nAnother £7m in add-ons is built into a deal which saw Manchester United ‘outmanoeuvre’ Real Madrid and Liverpool by spending sums other clubs absolutely did not want to spend on an 18-year-old with 60 first-team career appearances.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Mendy – £52m/€57.5m (Monaco to Manchester City, July 2017)\nAn incredibly rare misstep for a Manchester City side which tends to spend such considerable sums well.",
      "",
      "15) David Luiz – £50m/€62.5m (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, June 2014)\nDomestic Quadruples were won in both his full seasons in Paris, before Chelsea bought the Brazilian straight back for £16m less.",
      "",
      "16) Dean Huijsen – £50m/€59.4m (Bournemouth to Real Madrid, June 2025)\nA ridiculous success story for Bournemouth, who plucked Huijsen from a panicking Juventus and flipped a huge profit on the Spanish centre-half within a single season when Real Madrid came calling.",
      "",
      "17) Benjamin White – £50m/€58m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nArsenal started the bidding at £42m and had five offers turned down before acquiescing to Brighton’s initial demand for a guaranteed £50m, and all parties can be happy with their lot.",
      "",
      "18) John Stones – £50m/€57m (Everton to Manchester City, August 2016)\nReckon it might be safe to assume the £2.5m in add-ons have been achieved for a brilliant defender and apparently even better midfielder, even if various parts of him are made of glass.",
      "",
      "19) Kyle Walker £50m/€56.7m (Tottenham to Manchester City, July 2017)\nIt seemed preposterous at the time but the only absurd thing six years on is just how much Walker won as a trusted Guardiola lieutenant before both player and club sought something new.",
      "",
      "20) Lisandro Martinez – £48.3m/€57.3m (Ajax to Man Utd, July 2022)\nHe’s 5’9″ and Man Utd quite justifiably adore their short, World Cup-winning king.",

      "There’s encouragement from Europe for Arsenal and Manchester United fans, but Manchester City’s urgency is evident…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…\n20) Nico Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Arsenal\nOwing to Williams’ not-prohibitive release clause, this should be relatively simple if Arsenal really want to do it. But their interest is complicated by other costs that might be involved in signing the winger, for whom a new deal in Bilbao is not out of the question. This one seems to be getting further away, not closer. And it’s hard to ignore the spectre of Barca here.",
      "",
      "19) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nLiverpool were linked with the France forward but Chelsea have made an approach to Eintracht Frankfurt. The Blues’ problem: the Germans want £85million and they have little motivation to dramatically lower that demand.",
      "",
      "18) Mohammed Kudus 🆕 – West Ham to Chelsea\nThere’s a lot of noise around Kudus in recent days, the most recent suggesting he’s been offered to Chelsea for £85million. Kind offer, but not one the Blues are likely to take West Ham up on without a hefty discount. Robert Sanchez could be a makeweight.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Napoli\nRuben Amorim has made it painfully clear that Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford, which is a problem when they are asking for £60million. Napoli will not pay that. We await the awkwardness of Garnacho returning to United for pre-season before the serious conversations start.",

      "",
      "16) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal seemed to be heavy favourites to land Gyokeres but the Gunners are faffing while they suss out which striker they can do a better deal for. Right now, it’s gone a little quiet between Arsenal and Gyokeres and there seems to be more noise around the other fella.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nMartinez seems to have said his goodbyes to Villa and though he was linked with Barcelona, it seems the Catalans are pushing forward on a deal for Joan Garcia. There is renewed speculation of United’s intent to move for Martinez, for whom they made an offer in January, according to one report.",
      "👉 Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "",
      "14) Viktor Gyokeres 🆕 – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal yet to make a decision, there are plenty of reports that Gyokeres is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",

      "12) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "11) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to West Ham\nGiven Ramsdale’s habit of getting relegated, do West Ham really want to do this? Apparently so. Talks have taken place, with the Hammers set to be liable for £20million unless they can play on the fact Saints want the keeper’s £100k-a-wages off their books.",
      "",
      "10) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nApparently unmoved by the Champions League, Mbeumo has stated his preference for United over Newcastle, Arsenal and Spurs, but Brentford, not unreasonably, want a similar fee to that the Red Devils gave Wolves for Matheus Cunha. A first bid went in – £45million plus £10million – which was doomed to fail. A second ‘take-it-or-leave-it- offer is imminent.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack. After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. Talk have taken place ‘in the last 48 hours’ and seem to be progressing nicely.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.\n7) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool may have had one bid worth £109million turned down but the Reds have gone balls out for Wirtz and they won’t walk away over a few euros, especially when the player has matched their intent by stating he wants Anfield over the Allianz Arena. Once Wirtz gets international duty out of the way this weekend, we can expect some progress.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "6) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Reports suggest there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. We’ll see next week after the international break.\n5) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity got the easy part – they have agreed personal terms with Cherki – done early and have reportedly struck a deal with Lyon. City are in a hurry, so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed in the next week.",

      "There has clearly been a clash of personalities between Garnacho and Amorim, with a summer transfer the right outcome for all parties.",

      "“After the first meeting, £45m plus £10m was rejected by Brentford. The clubs have been in contact again,” Romano said.",
      "“Let’s see when the official bid will come, but it’ll be closer to what the Bees want. Brentford started at £70m, but as always with negotiations, they can drop to something like what Man Utd paid for Matheus Cunha, £62.5m. Let’s see how the conversation will go.",

      "Gomes, who was part of the England team that won the Under-21 European Championship two years ago, has not yet been selected by senior boss Thomas Tuchel, who takes charge of his third game when the Three Lions face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier in Barcelona on Saturday.",
      "The midfielder allowed his contract at Lille to expire and his search for a new club could soon be over, according to Sami Mokbel and BBC Sport. A move to Marseille appears to be on the cards.",
      "“Discussions are said to be progressing positively, with the Ligue 1 side hopeful they can seal his transfer in the coming days,” reports Mokbel.",

      "Renowned for his controlled midfield play and an impact that belies his physical stature, Gomes was part of the team that took Lille from mid-table in 2021-22 back into the European places the following year.",
      "They finished in fourth place in 2023-24 and successfully negotiated the Champions League play-off rounds before qualifying in an impressive seventh from the new league phase.",

      "An absolute breath of fresh air.",
      "You could see from the beginning, not only the fans loved ‘Angeball’ – the players loved it too. No longer were they told that they were ‘just Tottenham’. It was now “We’re Spurs, mate!” And the player played with a pride and vigour I hadn’t seen in years.",
      "After a beautiful first 10 games, what followed was 19 months of lunacy. A scattering of brief, glorious highs amidst a torrent of abject awful defeats. Crazy injuries, suspensions, shapeless formations, batterings. Following Spurs under Ange for 2 years probably aged me 10.",
      "But even still, it was exciting. Exciting to see a manager who trusted his vision, and a group of players who trusted that manager.",
      "MORE POSTECOGLOU SACK REACTION\n👉 England manager Thomas Tuchel speaks out after Tottenham’s ‘horrible’ Ange Postecoglou sacking\n👉 Five next move options for Ange Postecoglou post-Tottenham sack include Leeds United, Everton\n👉 Spurs face ‘player revolt’ over Ange sack as ‘so angry’ stars seek exit in aftermath of brutal decision",
      "Now let’s be fair: Ange wasn’t perfect. In January this year, many would say he should’ve been sacked with Spurs floundering in the league. Ange knew the writing on the wall, and he had to make a choice: If he pulled up his socks, and bet the house on recovering in the league, he probably could have got Spurs to a somewhat respectable 9th or 10th (remember, they could’ve finished as high as 14th on the final day). But Ange knew that would achieve nothing: He’d lose his job anyway, and more importantly, he’d have left no impact on Spurs – just another grey, forgettable season.",
      "So he went full rogue, threw the Premier League out the window and bet the house on doing the one thing that could change the entire mentality (and modern history) of Tottenham: Winning the Europa League.",
      "Ange gave Spurs fans and players one of the greatest experiences they’ll have in a lifetime of football. Arsenal fans can whinge about second tier trophies or whatever, but it doesn’t matter. Those players remember the feeling on the pitch, and those fans remember the parade, the confetti, the noise in Bilbao. Incredible.",
      "Ange leaves now with his head held high. He leaves with promises kept (He always wins things in his second season, mate) and have no doubt, he’ll rightly lap up all the credit for years to come on being the man who conquered the Spurs curse.",
      "Is it the right decision to move on? As an Ange fan, I have to say no. I think getting rid of Ange will send negative ripples through the team – he’s a leader to those players and they love him. He’s brought them the success he promised. It’s a huge challenge for whoever comes next.",
      "But what does the logical Spurs fan say? Maybe it is time. Maybe it’s even best for Ange – it might never have got better than this. Leave now as a hero, don’t wait and become the Villain.",
      "So who knows what lies ahead under Thomas Frank or whoever. I just hope my Spurs interest doesn’t wane again. It will take a serious contender to bring back the kind of excitement that Postecoglou did.",
      "Farewell Big Ange. Thanks for everything, mate!\nAndy, Spurs, Eire",

      "Crying wolf\nI don’t write in often but that mail from Badwolf left a bad taste in my mouth.",

      "Is Badwolf really just the Utd version of Stewie? So Bruno doesn’t want to go to Saudi Arabia and waste his life playing meaningless football in a joke league (look at how many goals Ronaldo is still scoring). Everyone else gets slated for moving there but god forbid Bruno doesn’t. I say fair play for not selling his soul.",
      "We don’t need the money – if you actually look how Utd finances work Big Jim was vastly overstating our position and, for now, can still afford to keep him. Especially if we sell some of the redundant homegrown players but even if not.",
      "Rashford had one good season. He was possibly the most selfish player in the league, and one worldie pass doesn’t change that. He isn’t wanted because he just isn’t that good, and his attitude stinks.",
      "As for Mount…how do you replace a player who is there week in, week out with a player who is never actually fit? Maybe BW wants us to play with 10 men and a permacrocked waste of money.",
      "Bruno has been, without question, our best player since he joined. He might be a moaner, but so was Keane. I get opposition fans railing on him, as we do to their players, but maybe actually stand by the team and stick up for our players?",
      "Whether he should be captain is a different question, but his numbers in a shambles of a team have been, year in and year out, world class, and if you want to state otherwise provide actual proof to the contrary instead of just moaning.",
      "I, as always, will go into the new season with my usual optimism and allow it to be drained over the course of the year.\nAndrew, a true MUFC fan",
      "",
      "The ‘crying little weakling’\nI know that I’m late to the subject on Bruno but I would just like to say this…the reason why people (football fans) don’t like Bruno and see him as an arm waving, selfish, whiny baby despite his great effort on the pitch, his consistency (compare availability with similar attacking midfielder like Odegard who seems to be injured all the time or Palmer who is talented but volatile), leadership skills- he does organize Man Utd’s play, defensive skills and clear motivation towards achieving victory for his team(his stats tell it all-he is truly world class) is simple.",
      "He is not handsome(appealing) enough to tempt most football fans.He does not appeal to football fans the way they would with other players in the same position, he displays a guilty face whenever he misses a chance or when he makes a mistake.",
      "He parades himself as the one responsible for any failure on the pitch that leads to defeat and seems almost about to cry (for  contrast-compare Vieira/Keane reaction to a mistake,they were either angry or keen on making amends-which is highly appealing to fans).",
      "Bruno is not stoic, he displays his feelings and weaknesses for everyone to see(compare this with other players-even Martin “amateur photographer” Odegard doesn’t display himself that much). This ultimately opens him to criticism,with fans seeing only a weak, guilty, whiny face.",
      "This coupled with inability to achieve victory for his team makes him a very ripe target because as much as we(football fans) may like to deny it, it is inescapable to admit that football is a cosmetic sport-we like the tough guy displays(Vieira, Keane-their manly fights), the electrifying displays(both Ronaldos, Henry-that goal against Liverpool, Hazard, Ribery), the man against all odds display(Wayne Rooney-that overhead kick, Vardy, Fabio cannavaro-a dwarf who rose above giants to claim victory), the stoic display(Tony Adams,Paolo Maldini and to a lesser extent Virgil).",
      "Bruno is ugly because he presents himself as a crying little weakling who is seeking our pity for his losses.\nJamo, Nairobi.",
      "",
      "I think he is a really bad player and a bully. He has bad technique gives the ball away more than any other midfielder in the league. He controls the game to make himself look good. He is a crybaby, cheats a lot with fouls.",
      "He is the reason united have done so badly. I thought he was a fake from the first day he arrived at united, he has really dragged them into the gutter. No united striker will score with Bruno in the team, he is supposed to be the creator but it’s something he simply can’t do he might get lucky once in a while but it’s all luck.",
      "United please sell him. Compare him to any player in his position and you will find he is the worst , hang on what is Bruno’s position\nDerrick",
      "",
      "I am happy they keeping Ferendes because he will not improve the team. He will score a few penalties and they will say he his world class.",
      "They are going to struggle for another season. Ha ha keep it up MU.\nMohan",

      "Nem and shame\nFor a change of subject, I see in my news feed that Nemanja Matic is facing a 2 match ban in France for covering anti-homophobia messages on his shirt.",
      "And it turns out not only was he not alone, but others have previously done it too.",
      "I’d love to say it was only in France, but while I’m sure it happens elsewhere (in particular Spain) it also happens in our own fair country. Mazraoui (I’m sure he wasn’t the only player in the country) refused to wear Pride-supporting clothing on more than one occasion while at United and as a result the whole side didn’t either, presumably “in solidarity”. What about solidarity with people being abused for existing?!?",
      "I am fully accepting of people having the right to not wear something; tolerating other people’s beliefs is important. But why should a community be shunned rather than supported because one member has beliefs that don’t align with the general accepted view. At least in France it was those players that stood alone and will be punished alone.",
      "If you don’t want to stand against x or y behaviour that is widely accepted as bad, then don’t play that match (and frankly, what are clubs doing giving these guys money if they’re pro-homophobia or anti equal rights). It doesn’t correspond to your personal beliefs? Ok, your choice, but they should be the ones out of step with the rest, not the rest align *with* them.",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for three of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history each, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "19) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",
      "",
      "20) Robert Sanchez – £20m/€23m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nWhile not the signing Chelsea most desperately wanted from Brighton, they nevertheless did not return empty-handed from their protracted Moises Caicedo negotiations as Sanchez headed to Stamford Bridge to provide competition for the No.1 entry on this list. Chelsea have obviously put him up for sale again.",

      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "Bruno Fernandes confirmed he has rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and revealed how talks with his wife and Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim were key in his decision.",
      "Al Hilal had been willing to almost treble Fernandes' £250,000-a-week wages, having been prepared to pay Manchester United £100m to sign the club's captain.",
      "On Tuesday evening, while on international duty with Portugal, Fernandes confirmed he had contact with Al Hilal but opted against the move because he wanted to \"stay at the highest level\".",
      "\"The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there,\" Fernandes told a press conference, according to Portuguese outlet O Jogo.",
      "\"I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I've always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.",
      "\"I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.",
      "\"I spoke to the club, who said they weren't willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.",
      "\"From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.",
      "\"I had to make the decision as a family and understand what I wanted for my future. That was the question my wife asked, what my professional goals would be. At no point did she say yes or no, she always supported me and put my professional side first.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Ruben Neves, Joao Cancelo. My children are used to playing with theirs.",
      "\"But I simply want to stay at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, because I still feel capable of that.",
      "\"I want to continue to be happy and do what I love most. I'm still very passionate about this sport. It's my way of seeing football and I'm happy with my decision.\"",
      "Manchester United do not want to sell their captain. He has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",

      "\"But on the other hand, Manchester United's star player, sometimes the only player, for the past five or six years has been Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"He's the one player I can point towards as a success out of all the big signings they have made. He's the only player who has the personality and courage needed - if he plays well Manchester United always have a chance of winning a game.",
      "\"The fact he wants to stay, despite all the money on offer, will endear him to Manchester United fans even more. To turn that money down, when United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'no, I want to fight', says a lot about him as a person and character.",
      "\"Him staying, Matheus Cunha coming in, gives them a couple of players with personality, and that might just make a difference next season.\"",
