      "The United legend shared a selfie from his hospital bed on X and gave a thumbs-up, adding: \"Gutted to be missing the Semi-Finals this week on @footballontnt!! Wishing the team all the best - I'll be watching every minute from the iPad!\"",
      "Now the reason for him being admitted to hospital has emerged. The Daily Mail report that Ferdinand has come down with a sickness bug.",
      "Members of the 81-time England international's family have also been affected by the illness. Ferdinand is continuing his recovery and will remain off air until he's back to full health.",
      "TNT have the rights to broadcast Sunday's Premier League match between Newcastle and Chelsea at St James' Park which could be an opportunity for Ferdinand to return. For now, he'll have to continue watching on his iPad or television.",
      "The 46-year-old streamed Arsenal's 2-1 defeat in Paris which saw the the Gunners dumped out. Ferdinand posted about one particular moment in the match, as PSG were awarded a controversial penalty after a handball by Myles Lewis-Skelly. \"Horrendous decision,\" he posted on X.",
      "Arsenal were already 1-0 down on aggregate heading into their European second leg while United boast a 3-0 advantage from their comfortable victory in Spain last week. Ferdinand's former side know that so long as they avoid a major collapse, their ticket to the Europa League final is assured.",
      "Will Manchester United reach the Europa League final? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants to make sure that his players don't cede control of the tie, writing in his programme notes: \"Athletic Club are a very good team, and they caused us problems in the opening stages in San Mames, so we cannot just assume the game will go the same way it did last Thursday. We will need total focus and effort to keep control of the game, and the tie.",
      "\"It is a boost to be playing the second leg at home because we know what a special place Old Trafford can be on European nights, as we saw in the quarter-final against Lyon last month, when the fans helped us get over the line. The support we have received throughout such a difficult season has been incredible and we want to reward our fans by winning the UEFA Europa League.\""

      "Despite holding a 3-0 aggregate lead, Manchester United are not guaranteed a spot in the Europa League final on Thursday. That's according to Old Trafford legend Gary Pallister, who warned his old club the semi-final clash with Athletic Bilbao could still take an unexpected turn.",
      "The Red Devils capitalised on an early red card given to Athletic's Dani Vivian during last week's first leg at San Mames. Bruno Fernandes led the team to victory with two goals in the first half, but this still might not be enough to secure their advancement.",
      "Lyon managed to score four goals at the Theatre of Dreams in the last round, after all, even though two of those goals were scored in extra time with the French visitors down to 10 men. Old Trafford has lost its reputation as an impenetrable fortress, however, with both Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth snatching 3-0 wins there in the Premier League this season.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui nearly extended United's lead to four goals in Bilbao, but his shot hit the crossbar just before half-time. The match might have been out of reach for Athletic if that attempt had gone in, but Pallister explained even a three-goal lead isn't enough to guarantee victory for the current United squad.",
      "United's chances of keeping a clean sheet against the visiting team are looking better after reports surfaced that brothers Nico and Inaki Williams won't be featuring in the second leg due to injuries. Adding to that, Ernesto Valverde's leading goal scorer, Oihan Sancet, is also out of action for the Manchester matchup.",
      "On the other hand, United manager Ruben Amorim faces his own selection headache with defensive concerns, particularly after Matthijs de Ligt was injured in Sunday's 4-3 loss to Brentford. He will join Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot on the sidelines, while youngster Ayden Heaven might not recover in time for the game.",
      "United icon Pallister - who pipped Barcelona to the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, as well as winning four Premier League titles and three FA Cups - suggests United should adopt a more patient strategy in the second salvo against Athletic. He specifically notes that certain defensive positions could be key in curtailing Athletic's advances.",
      "\"I think you've got to be rock tight at the back. Your guys in front of that back four, back five. We don't want to be advancing whoever's playing wing-backs,\" he said. \"We want to sit in there and make sure we frustrate them. Let them know that it's not going to be easy to score against us, because that's them being desperate.",
      "\"I think they've got to try and score early and make Old Trafford nervous, which is what Lyon did eventually. Expect a lot more from [Athletic] in this return leg. But yeah, if we can be solid.",
      "\"I'd surely be telling the wing-backs let's not go flying forward. They probably did in the early part of the game in Bilbao, which surprised me a little bit. They tried to play on the front foot from the start, but as I say, they got forced back by Athletic, because we kept giving the ball away.\"",
      "The Europa League represents United's final shot at silverware this season, and clinching the trophy is their only route back to Europe next term. Whomever triumphs in their semi-final will go head-to-head with either Bodo/Glimt or Tottenham, with Spurs having a 3-1 lead prior to their second-leg clash in Norway on Thursday."

      "Marcus Rashford is said to have partnered with super-agent Pini Zahavi as well as indicating a willingness to lower his salary demands in order to help facilitate a move to Barcelona.",
      "The England star, 27, is expected to leave Manchester United permanently this summer and the Nou Camp is his dream destination. Crucially, Rashford has managed to boost his stock during the second half of the season after joining Aston Villa on loan but interest in his services from Barca is longstanding.",
      "While Rashford ending up staying in the Premier League, there have been numerous reports outlining his desire to join the Spanish giants should he leave Old Trafford for good.",
      "And a new report from Mundo Deportivo has claimed that Rashford is now being represented by Zahavi; an agent with close ties to Barcelona who also represents their manager, Hansi Flick, and Robert Lewandowski.",
      "It's claimed that the main reason for the move on Rashford's end is due to the fact that Zahavi has strong links to Barca, who do have a void to fill in the left-hand side of their front three with Ansu Fati failing to make an impression on Flick.",
      "Zahavi is believed to have a strong relationship with the club's president, Joan Laporta, and it's claimed that talks over a loan move this summer have already taken place.",
      "The news will come as a blow to Aston Villa, who negotiated a £40million option to purchase Rashford permanently as part of the deal that saw him move to Villa Park in the winter transfer window.",
      "He has four goals and six assists to his name in a Villa shirt but is expected to miss the remainder of the season through injury.",
      "United's preference would be to sell their homegrown star, who was dropped by Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese coach is aiming to reshape his playing squad this summer and any transfer fees that can be raised from offloading unwanted stars - such as Rashford and Antony, who has also enjoyed a renaissance away from Old Trafford - would be welcomed by the club.",
      "It remains to be seen if Barcelona would be able to meet Manchester United's demands to finance a permanent deal given their cash woes in recent years, while the former may be reluctant to sanction another temporary move for Rashford."

      "Paul Parker claims that the \"last thing\" Marcus Rashford would want this summer is a return to Manchester United, as he feels the England forward hasn't shown \"much difference\" in his performances at Aston Villa. Rashford joined the Villains on loan in January, after United head coach Ruben Amorim failed to see eye-to-eye with him.",
      "Following his loan move, Amorim was frank about his decision to let Rashford explore a new challenge, saying: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it.",
      "\"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "Since then, Rashford has made 17 appearances for Villa, scoring four goals and assisting six times. His most notable performances came in the Champions League, where he assisted once in the quarter-finals against Paris Saint-Germain to win the home leg 3-2 - but the team lost 5-4 on aggregate to the current finalists.",
      "While many people have been impressed with Rashford's form at his new club, one person who isn't too pleased is ex-United defender Parker, who has claimed the striker hasn't done enough to gain respect in the transfer market.",
      "Parker told BestBettingSites.com that the 27-year-old could have scraped up enough stability to push for a move away from United this summer. This is despite the fact that the former defender feels a transfer is the best plan for Rashford, who wouldn't want to return to Old Trafford.",
      "The two-time Premier League winner said: \"I think someone might come in and decide who wants to buy him, someone might take him on loan. I don't think he can do it for Manchester United, because from what I saw, when I watched him at Villa, and there wasn't much difference there, to be honest.\"",
      "Parker also lamented Unai Emery's decision to play Rashford ahead of other Villa stars, as he said: \"I have to say, if you're someone like Jacob Ramsey, you'd be a little bit disappointed. He played in front of you. If you were Watkins as well, you'd be gutted that you were left off the PSG games for him to play in your role.",
      "\"Did he do enough to shake enough trees for people to say, we want him? I personally don't think so. But PR-wise it was very good for him because he was being sold well on PR about how he'd done, but everything was always little points.\"",
      "Crucially, he added: \"So on that side of it people were trying to make the best of it, really. So I don't know how he's feeling, but I think the last thing he would want to be doing was coming back to Manchester United. And if Villa don't sign him, I've got no idea who would be interested.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Parker has slammed Rashford's character on and off the pitch, however; he previously told MyBettingSites in January this year that he was \"fed up\" with the footballer.",
      "Parker even went on to claim that the forward had been \"s******* on his own doorstep\" and disrespecting United that many times, that the hierarchy of the club will have lost far too much trust in him.",
      "The former Old Trafford star said: \"I’m fed up with Rashford to be honest. I was shocked. You have to be shocked, really. On the other hand you shouldn’t be shocked because that’s just what he does. He is a local boy and everyone is expecting him to behave better. He is just carrying on what he has done for a lot of years.",
      "\"He was given an incredible contract and now he is just enjoying his life. He was at a good level during the pandemic but he has ruined everything now. People were still backing him but the majority are just fed up with him now.\"",
      "Parker added: \"You live and die by the people you play with, and he has to remember that. I think it might end up with Rashford having to find a new club, and the teammates will have a hard time trusting him. Are they going to trust him? No, because he has been s******* on his own doorstep so many times.",
      "\"He needs to think about the fact that he is Manchester through and through. He will live in this city after he retires and he has to live with all these stories about his professionalism. It’s not going to be an enjoyable time for him to be honest.\"",
      "While United are struggling in the Premier League right now, sitting in 15th place with three games to go, they do have the second leg of a Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao to contend with on Thursday, holding a 3-0 lead going into the game.",
      "It is unclear whether Rashford – who has been linked with Barcelona of late – will return to his boyhood club in the summer to work under Amorim or head to pastures anew for the first time in his 10-year career. Whatever is decided, Parker believes there is no way back for the forward at the club who gave him his start in the sport."

Former England star Chris Waddle reckons Cunha could have the same transformational impact for United as Cantona did and backed the Brazil forward to become an Old Trafford icon if he makes the move.",

And what do we need to put around the team, the manager and the club to ensure we have that success?",

But I’ve spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. That’s the kind of thing that we want to create.",

That’s what we want to create. We want to create that community, add to the community and fan base we’ve already got — and then lift it.",
      "“When you see what the Toms are doing, there is investment, there is a plan and it would be the dream to talk about the growth of Salford City.",

Because if we’re having success then we’re also having the opportunity to say: ‘Now we we’re going to invest, now we’re going to get a bigger stadium, now we’re going to get a bigger training facility and then it will go on. That is what we’re aiming for.",
      "Neville added: “I feel very strongly that owners are just guardians of football clubs for fans and the idea is that fans should have access behind the scenes to what people are doing in the club. It’s almost like a public company and it should be treated as such because of its importance to the community.",
      "“We’ve never been shy in coming forward in respect of content for the club and that will be the same moving forward. But there are different innovative ways that can be done that isn’t just a straight documentary.\"",
      "He added: “We have to be successful on the pitch, we have to invest in the local area and we also need to look at our infrastructure; the stadium and training ground. We’ve invested heavily over the last 10 years and we’ll invest heavily again in this next four or five years — but we need to get this club on a firm footing financially and get balance into this club.",
      "“There are very good examples of clubs in League Two, League One and the Championship who are almost sustainable, with a little bit of owner funding. They have created a player trading model and financial and commercial revenue streams that mean that they can look at things slightly differently and be successful, whilst being more sustainable.”",
      "Declan Kelly and Mervyn Davies said in a joint statement: “We have been close friends and partners for more than a decade and we look forward to partnering with David, Gary, this phenomenal new ownership group, the Class of ’92 and everyone at SCFC to take this project to the next level and hopefully bring more success to Salford City’s wonderful fan base, players and everyone associated with the club.”",
      "Salford finished eighth in League Two this season, just outside of the players. They have been in the fourth tier of English football for the past six seasons and flirted with a return to the National League last term."

      "David Beckham’s desire to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid was solidified after the club tried to flog him to Barcelona. Beckham became a Galactico in 2003 when he swapped Old Trafford for the Bernabeu – but the transfer only came to fruition after Barca got involved in a tug of war.",
      "The England star came through the United academy and played for the club for 11 years before deciding to move elsewhere. A falling out with manager Sir Alex Ferguson played a role in the decision, with Fergie writing in his 2013 autobiography: “David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game.”",
      "He added: “The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager he had to go... David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. There is no doubt about that in my mind.”",
      "Real Madrid ended up paying €35million (£25m) to United for Beckham and the right midfielder joined on a four-year contract which was reportedly worth €6m per year. But had United chairman Peter Kenyon got his way, Beckham would have actually joined Barcelona instead.",
      "\"My team was always Real Madrid and funnily enough I got sold from Manchester United to Barcelona,\" he told CBS Sports. \"I was on holiday, Peter Kenyon phoned me and he said: 'We've accepted a bid from Barcelona and we're selling you'.",
      "\"I said: 'If you are going to sell me, the only team I want to move to is Real Madrid', because I always had a dream of playing for Real Madrid when I was a young kid.",
      "\"I never thought I'd leave Manchester United but if I did, you know, I'd love to have played for Real Madrid. And if they wanted me to leave then the only club that I wanted to go to was Real Madrid.\" Beckham added: \"Funnily enough, in a day and a half, it happened.”",
      "In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4, Beckham admitted that United’s desire to sell him to a club he didn’t want to join helped clarify his thoughts about joining a star-studded Real. “There was never any revenge. I was hurt and angry at the time at how the situation had gone because throughout the season I was left out of certain games but never thought it would lead to me leaving,” he said.",
      "\"I then flew back to London. I tried to speak to Peter Kenyon and tried to speak to the manager and he said 'no'. I said 'well I need to speak to him and understand what is going on'. He said 'it's true, we have agreed a deal'.",
      "\"That is when I spoke to my agent and said 'if I am going to move, I'm going to move to Madrid'. Within a day, I was sat with the president of Madrid and we agreed that is where I was going to go.”"

      "Three years ago last week, Alejandro Garnacho's family were moved to tears in the directors' box at Old Trafford as, donning the No.47 shirt, he stepped onto the pitch for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea.",
      "At just 17 years old, Ralf Rangnick had spotted Garnacho's potential, which had been instrumental in leading United's academy to the FA Youth Cup final. Following his first-team debut, Garnacho returned to Old Trafford two weeks later and sealed the victory against Nottingham Forest with a brace.",
      "Since than, United have kept Garnacho from extensive media exposure. But on Wednesday, for the first time since his arrival in Manchester four-and-a-half years ago, Garnacho made his first Carrington press appearance.",
      "It came at a time where his long-term future is somewhat uncertain. In January, Napoli saw a £40million bid rejected while Chelsea have shown interest too. Both could launch summer moves. But Garnacho - a product of Atletico Madrid's and United's development as a winger - is now adapting to life under a coach devoted to a 3-4-2-1 formation. He's started 13 matches on the trot and is set to make it 14 against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night.",
      "He conceded that the initial transition under Ruben Amorim had been \"difficult\". And he joined Marcus Rashford in being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby back in mid-December due to issues with their attitude. Since then, Rashford hasn't played for United and might never again.",
      "But Garnacho has knuckled down and is firmly back en vogue. United are closing in on a deal for Matheus Cunha which looks near enough done, sparking talk that Garnacho's place as a starter could be under threat as the club seeks a new No. 10 and a specialist.",
      "Yet this is the winger who surged past Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Martial, and Anthony Elanga in the fight for the left-wing spot. Garnacho has outlasted them all. Former teammates from Jose Mourinho's days at the helm have taken note of Rashford's inability to take criticism well. Meanwhile, Garnacho showcased self-reflection during his discussion at Carrington.",
      "Garnacho admitted: \"I think it's difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation. But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "\"It's a little bit hard but it's just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.\"",
      "In preparation for the quarter-final second leg against Lyon, United opted for Harry Maguire to partner Amorim as they sought a \"leader\" for the press address. According to club insiders, Garnacho took the initiative himself to step up here, realising he hadn't previously faced pre-match media responsibilities and he fancied taking the lead.",
      "He wanted to convey his happiness at the club: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.\"",
      "Having played 140 times for United, Garnacho joining Amorim at the media forefront signalled his ascending maturity and experience.",
      "Despite having emulated Cristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations, Garnacho modestly sidestepped direct comparisons with the legendary winger. He is just a single goal shy of equalling the 27 goals Ronaldo netted in his initial three years with United. Ronaldo was 21 years old in his third season with the club back in 2005-06, and Garnacho is set to celebrate his own 21st birthday this July.",
      "When it comes to statistics, Garnacho downplays their significance. \"I'm not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.\"",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "Four members of Garnacho's family were spotted in the United executives' section in Bilbao last week, proudly wearing 'Garnacho 17' on their shirts. If he remains, it may not be long until he's upgraded to the club's much-vaunted No.7."

      "Both Spurs and United have already opened applications to purchase tickets, due to the very small window between now and the final kicking off.",
      "Rather than the clubs themselves, UEFA will handle the ticket purchasing and distribution. Prices range from €40 (£34) for Category 4 tickets, all the way to Category 1 tickets which ill cost €240 (£204). There is an option for restricted view tickets at the top category level, which will set you back €190 (£161)."

The Argentina international was the subject of transfer interest from Chelsea back in January and it's thought that United would consider serious offers for the majority of their playing squad in order to help them finance an overhaul ahead of the new season.",

If he comes to Betis, it’s a place where he’ll regain his value, which is what they wanted, because it’s through his play, and because it’s a place that adapts very well to the type of game Antony had.”",

      "Juventus are interested in a transfer for Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund and could offer midfielder Douglas Luiz as a makeweight in the deal. The Serie A giants have long been interested in the former Atalanta forward.",
      "United have failed to help Hojlund become a consistent goalscorer since his £72million move to Old Trafford. The Denmark star, 22, has scored 25 goals across two seasons but only four of those have come in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils are planning to replenish their forward line this summer and are expected to move for Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who has a £62.5m release clause, and have the likes of Victor Osimhen and Liam Delap under their consideration. Such moves across the forward line could leave Hojlund's future uncertain as Ruben Amorim looks to form a team suited to his philosophy.",
      "Reports in Italy suggest that Juve are hoping to take advantage as they also look towards forming a new forward line, with Dusan Vlahovic expected to leave. The Turin-based side are hoping to boost their reserves with £34m from his sale.",
      "To aid in their bid for Hojlund, Juventus would consider using ex-Arsenal target Douglas Luiz. The Brazilian only joined the club from Aston Villa less than a year ago but has struggled to make a strong impression.",
      "Luiz is seen as an 'important' card to play in any negotiations despite his difficult time in Italy. The former Villa ace has made 24 appearances for the Old Lady but failed to find the net or provide an assist since his £42m move.",
      "The 26-year-old was once the subject of multiple deadline-day bids from Arsenal and could already be searching for the next step in his career. Despite limited game time under Thiago Motta, Chelsea are credited with interest in the midfielder.",
      "In January, Luiz was touted as possible part of a swap deal that would have seen Joshua Zirkzee head to northern Italy after his own difficult start. It remains to be seen if United could be tempted by Luiz's presence in any offer for Hojlund.",
      "Amorim suggested that Hojlund recently played his best game under the Portuguese coach's stewardship. The young forward impressed in the Europa League semi-final first leg win over Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The United boss refused to get carried away with 's performance however. “It's hard to say but I think it was the best game that he had with me as a coach,\" he said.",
      "“He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made the runs, and then decided quite well. It's a good moment for him but like Harry [Maguire] he needs to understand that everything can change. Let's focus on the next one. This is in the past, we have a tough one on Sunday against Brentford and then again in the second leg.”"

This win puts them in a strong position to advance to the final, offering a chance to redeem what has been a challenging season for the club.",

      "Manchester United will be without half a dozen players including defender Matthijs de Ligt for Thursday night's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club due to injury.",
      "Netherlands defender De Ligt is also set to miss the weekend fixture against West Ham United despite head coach Ruben Amorim insisting that the muscle injury picked up in the 4-3 defeat away to Brentford last week is not a serious one. He joins long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines, with Ayden Heaven and Toby Collyer also still unavailable.",
      "“It is not a big issue, that is the good thing,” Amorim said on Wednesday at his pre-match press conference. “He cannot play tomorrow or Sunday (against West Ham United) but then we will check day by day. The rest I think Ayden doesn’t recover, Toby is not available and I think that is it.”",
      "United lead 3-0 after last week's first leg at San Mames and will face Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur or Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt in the final later this month.",
      "Athletic Club, however, arrive in Manchester with an even bigger hole in their side after both Nico and Inaki Williams were ruled out.",
      "Top scorer Oihan Sancet missed the first leg through injury and has not recovered in time to play a part at Old Trafford. Dani Vivian will also miss out, with the defender's red card in the first leg earning him a suspension.",
      "Despite the apparent advantage in terms of available personnel, Amorim has admitted he does not know which version of his team will turn up at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Yeah, it’s hard to say. Sometimes, it’s not what kind of team we will be tomorrow,” Amorim said at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\"If you look at our team, we cannot say today what is going to happen. There are some teams in any league that can understand that the game is going to be like this.",
      "“Things can change a little bit, but the story is going to be like this and we can control the narrative of the game. We cannot do that.",
      "“So we have to face the game as just one more game. I feel that we need to score to go to the next round, so that's clearly the way we are going to face the game.”"

      "Dimitar Berbatov has warned Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirzkee that they are on borrowed time at Manchester United - unless they start finding the back of a net before the summer transfer window.",
      "Both Hojlund and Zirkzee, a summer signing from Bologna, have struggled to score regularly this season and head into the final weeks of the campaign with just four and three Premier League goals to their name respectively. Their fortunes in front of goal has fuelled speculation that the club are keen to sign a new No.9 in the off-season.",
      "Liam Delap is among the players who have been linked with a summer switch to Old Trafford after plundering 12 league goals for Ipswich Town.",
      "United's goal struggles are a far cry from their heyday, where they scored goals for fun under Sir Alex Ferguson. And Berbatov reckons Ruben Amorim will only keep faith in his misfiring forwards for so long.",
      "Speaking to Four Four Two magazine, the former United striker said: “Well, different time, different football, different players. United have been going through a difficult period in the Premier League, and especially even more so now that Liverpool have won the 20th title, which obviously is a big disappointment for everybody connected to United.",
      "“As for their striker dilemma, that will stay until either the current strikers start scoring goals regularly, or the new season comes and the manager decides his patience is no longer there with them, and maybe he’ll go for someone else.",
      "“Until the season finishes, I hope that whoever is given the chance to play up front can take this chance really seriously, because they need to know that when the new season comes, everything starts anew, the manager will have more time to prepare the team from the beginning.”",
      "Hojlund's struggles in front of goal has seen the former Atalanta man linked with a return to Serie A this week. It's claimed that Juventus are interested in the Denmark international, who moved to United in a deal totalling £72million.",
      "It remains to be seen if Hojlund would be given the green light to leave Old Trafford permanently but the club are looking to raise further transfer funds to give Amorim greater scope when it comes to rebuilding his playing squad."

      "Manchester United will be aiming to wrap up their place in the Europa League final when they face Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their semi-final tussle at Old Trafford this evening, kick-off 8pm.",
      "United take a 3-0 aggregate lead into tonight's game after putting Athletic to the sword at the San Mames Stadium in Spain a week ago.",
      "The Reds put one foot in the final via goals from Bruno Fernandes (2) and Casemiro, meaning they will be determined to avoid letting their advantage slip between their fingers.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim, however, is refusing to take Athletic lightly, insisting his side \"cannot take anything for granted\" in his programme notes. He also said in yesterday's press conference that United must get themselves on the scoresheet this evening.",
      "United will be without centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, who was forced off at Brentford with a suspected knee injury, but Amad will be pushing for a start after two appearances from the bench after overcoming an ankle injury.",
      "Follow the LIVE blog below for regular updates and analysis from Old Trafford throughout the evening...",
      "A few hundred Athletic fans are already in the away end. Some are also in the home end next to the away end. Hopefully we do not have another Rangers/Galatasaray on our hands this evening but some red-and-white shirted Athletic fans are sat in the same block as United fans.",
      "It was rather predictable that Amorim would go with Lindelof but Amad would’ve been the bolder pick. Amorim is prone to overloading United’s XI with defensive players but it feels unnecessary tonight. Lindelof was also a liability in Bilbao.",
      "Nevertheless, it should be moot. United are 3-0 up from the first leg.",
      "This is how the away side line up.",
      "XI | Onana, Lindelof, Maguire, Yoro, Mazraoui, Dorgu, Casemiro, Ugarte, Garnacho, Hojlund, Fernandes.",
      "Subs | Bayindir, Heaton, Amass, Fredricson, Kamason, Shaw, Eriksen, Mainoo, Mount, Amad, Mantato.",
      "TNT are showing highlights from last night’s game and they had a camera fixed on Jack Wilshere. Wilshere repeatedly said ‘we’ during his punditry and Martin Keown is an Arsenal ambassador.",
      "Last night was another three-man commentary team, too. Our esteemed colleague James Ducker asked a salient question when he wondered whether it was possible to tune into John Murray’s commentary on BBC Radio Five Live through the television whilst watching the game. Radio commentary is much better than anything on the television and, most infamously, TNT transformed into MUTV against Lyon a few weeks ago.",
      "Depressingly, actual media outlets think punters want this subjective nonsense. Maybe they do. But the media and journalism should forever remain an impartial industry.",
      "United have scored 31 goals in this season's Europa League – more than any other side.",
      "Only in 2002-03 (32) and 2020-21 (34) have they ever scored more in a single campaign in major European competition.",
      "We'll have the starting teams at 6.45pm.",
      "This is the fifth time United have been involved in the Europa League since 2016/17 and the fourth time they have made the semi-final. If they finish the job tonight it will be their third Europa League final in nine years and that is a Sevilla-esque record. The problem, of course, is that United don’t aspire to be like Sevilla, but to be like Real Madrid or Barcelona. Conquering the Europa League this season will at least allow them a route back into the Champions League. Then they will need to do what has been beyond this club for the past 11 years and stay there on a regular basis. They want to be A-listers, not very successful B-listers.",
      "United’s team tonight should be the team that starts the final. There is no need to recall Victor Lindelof when Noussair Mazraoui (centre back) and Amad (right wing) are available. Whatever United’s best XI is (and it needs to be nigh-on unrecognisable at the start of next season), Amad is in it.",
      "He has played on the right wing a number of times for Amorim and it is better for the team’s balance to have some attacking intent on the wings. Dalot and Mazraoui was too conservative a pairing, albeit there was no credible alternative. The last time United lost 3-0 at home, Tyrell Malacia started.",
      "United had a nervy night here eight years ago against Celta Vigo when they squeezed into the Europa League final. It feels very different tonight and everything is stacked in United’s favour.",
      "Outside the stadium, there is no discernible difference from any other evening kick-off at Old Trafford. United fans, for once, will be turning up expecting a win after what happened last week.",
      "Athletic’s fans are certainly bringing their A-game to Manchester, even if the players aren’t. The absence of their first-choice attack has killed this contest off before we even begin the second leg. The club’s fans have seen their once-in-a-lifetime dream of a European final on homesoil get away from them, but they have made for quite a sight in the city centre today and look determined to give their team the backing they require to try and pull off a miracle tonight.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was a confident speaker in his first set-piece media event in his United career on Wednesday. At one point he asked if he should answer a question from a Spanish journalist in English or Spanish and was told he could decide. There would have been a time when United were fearful of Spanish questions to a player who many expected to return to La Liga at some point. In January the interest in him came from London and Naples. The attraction of a sale is still there but tonight will be his 14th start in a row and he will have played in 100 of United’s last 101 games. He is building an impressive CV, his form has been excellent of late and he is now one of the first names on the teamsheet in that No. 10 role.",
      "This could or should be as calm a European home semi-final for United as it was against Schalke in 2011. They won that 6-1 on aggregate after a 2-0 first leg away victory in Gelsenkirchen.",
      "Athletic Bilbao don’t have the Williams brothers but United have lost so often at Old Trafford since the start of last season that the Williams sisters could cause them strife. They have been beaten 3-0 at home three times this season, which is why Amorim has struck a stern tone since last week’s 3-0 win.",

      "Athletic will be without Niko and Inaki Williams while their top scorer, Oihan Sancet, is still sidelined through injury.",

      "Amorim revealed he has rewatched the first 30 minutes of United's match in Bilbao last week when Athletic dominated before Dani Vivian was sent off in the 35th minute. United took the lead on the 30-minute mark through Casemiro having survived an intense start from the home side.",

      "It was three years ago last week that the Garnachos were reduced to tears in the Old Trafford directors' box. Alejandro, wearing the number 47, crossed the white line for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea.",
      "Ralf Rangnick recognised Garnacho's qualities as a 17-year-old who had inspired the academy to the FA Youth Cup final. Back at Old Trafford two weeks after Garnacho's senior bow, he decided the final against Nottingham Forest with two goals.",
      "United have been naturally reluctant to make Garnacho available to the media. Four-and-a-half years after he touched down in Manchester with the Covid-19 pandemic impinging on the public's freedom, Garnacho attended his first press engagement at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Usually, there are a handful of questions for the player as the focus is on the coach. It was different with Garnacho. He was the academy poster boy of not just Erik ten Hag's reign but United's future.",
      "That was in doubt in January. Napoli had a £40million offer knocked back. Chelsea have stockpiled almost enough youngsters to fill Stamford Bridge but also expressed interest.",
      "Garnacho was developed as a winger by Atletico Madrid and United only to now be coached by a man wedded to a 3-4-2-1 system. He admitted his first weeks under Ruben Amorim were \"difficult\".",
      "Amorim omitted Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad on account of their attitude in mid-December. Rashford has not played for United and may never do so again. Garnacho has played in every match since.",
      "He has started in 13 successive matches and it will be a 14th against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday evening. Amorim has spoken about him in such glowing terms he was not actually asked about Garnacho, sat to his right, at the pre-match press conference.",
      "United's interest in Matheus Cunha is now so advanced it would be a surprise if the deal does not materialise. United need a new No.10 and a specialist, which threatens Garnacho's starting status.",
      "But this is a winger who barged ahead of Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Anthonys Martial and Elanga in the left-wing pecking order. Garnacho has survived them all.",
      "Teammates as far back as Jose Mourinho's tenure noticed Rashford did not react well to criticism. Garnacho was self-critical during his sit-down at Carrington.",
      "\"I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,\" Garnacho explained. \"But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "\"It’s a little bit hard but it’s just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.\"",
      "United chose Harry Maguire to flank Amorim ahead of the quarter-final second leg against Lyon as they wanted a \"leader\" to address the press. That was Maguire's second media attendance in the Europa League this term and United were running out of willing talkers.",
      "Garnacho has conducted some rights-holder chats with Kobbie Mainoo and an impromptu post-match debrief on the Old Trafford pitch after the 2-0 victory over Everton last season. His English was like some of his wing play - fluent and swift. It was difficult to keep up with the transcribing.",
      "Club sources say Garnacho wanted to do it himself as he recognised he had never sat in for pre-match duties before. There was no specific message to get across. Garnacho has played 140 times for United and his presence at the top table with Amorim reflected his growing maturity and experience.",
      "For someone who mimicked Cristiano Ronaldo's celebrations at youth and senior level, Garnacho downplayed comparisons between the wingers. He is one goal away from matching the 27 Ronaldo tallied in his first three seasons at United.",
      "Ronaldo turned 21 in his third campaign in 2005-06. Garnacho celebrates his coming of age in July. His form last season, in particular, would suggest he was two years ahead of schedule.",
      "\"I’m not focused on the numbers,\" he shrugged. \"I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "In Bilbao last week, four members of the Garnacho family sat in the United executives' section, all with 'Garnacho 17' on the back of their shirt. If Garnacho stays long enough at United, his squad number might be upgraded again to a standalone '7'."

      "Despite navigating their way to the semi-finals with an unbeaten record in Europe this season, United were by no means favourites for this tie. Athletic boast the best defence in La Liga this season, had lost just twice at home across all competitions this term and had won each of their first six home games in the Europa League.",
      "Although United had to withstand plenty of early pressure, Casemiro's opener settled them down and from that moment onwards the Bilbao floodgates opened. However, despite taking a 3-0 lead into tonight's game, plenty of United fans will arrive at Old Trafford feeling jittery.",
      "If the Portuguese chief deploys the same XI as the one that started in Bilbao, he must be confident they will deliver the goods again and finish the job.",
      "With Matthijs de Ligt ruled out and Ayden Heaven still sidelined, Amorim's biggest decision is set to come in central-defence. Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Victor Lindelof started in the back-three last week and all were rested from the start at Brentford at the weekend, indicating they could reclaim their places this evening.",
      "Lindelof is set to leave Old Trafford at the end of this season and the prospect of him bowing out by helping United reach the Europa League final would be a fine way to sign off. However, Amad's recent return from injury may just tempt Amorim to tweak the landscape of his defence.",
      "The Ivorian, who recently recovered from an ankle injury, made his second appearance via the bench since his recovery on Sunday, storing 45 minutes under his belt in the second half. He also marked the occasion by scoring his tenth goal of the season.",
      "Amad quickly adapted to Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 system and was initially tasked with operating as the right-sided wing-back. However, prior to his injury, he moved to the right-sided No.10 and looked equally comfortable.",
      "But with Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes locking out the two No.10 positions in recent weeks, Amad's route back into the starting XI may be via the right wing-back berth. Diogo Dalot is currently unavailable due to a calf injury and Noussair Mazraoui has deputised.",
      "As good as the Moroccan was at wing-back in the Basque Country a week ago, his versatility makes him a credible option to slide into the back-three and take Lindelof's spot, opening up a window of opportunity for Amad to make his way back into the team.",
      "The prospect of Amad starting on the right and Patrick Dorgu on the left would mark a new wing-back paring for Amorim. Effective wing-backs are the key to making Amorim's system work in the way it should, with the Portuguese chief determined for width and athleticism to be provided down the flanks.",
      "Already 3-0 up on aggregate, Old Trafford should be rocking come kick-off this evening, and the prospect of seeing Amad's name among the starters on the teamsheet will increase the energy levels. He has been one of the biggest successes of Amorim's short tenure thus far and he has the ability to excite.",
      "With Amad on one flank and Dorgu on the other, Amorim would be approaching the game with the ambition of getting the goal he believes his side needs to keep their Europa League dream alive."

      "Manchester United are 90 minutes away from a fifth final in five seasons and even their worst domestic team in 51 years is not expected to cock up their three-goal advantage against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "United are in a dream of a position against Athletic, who will be without Inaki and Nico Williams while top scorer Oihan Sancet is also still unavailable.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt is out after his impact injury against Brentford on Sunday. Christian Eriksen did not participate in the open training session on Wednesday but is fit and available. Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer are out.",
      "Here are five things to look out for this evening:",
      "No comeback?",
      "The absence of the Williams brothers might have caused another surge in prices for flights to Bilbao from Manchester in two weeks. Athletic Bilbao are far from certain of playing in the Champions League next season and their priority now feels like it has switched from Europa League to La Liga.",
      "In 133 Uefa Cup and Europa League knockout ties, no team has gone out after leading by three goals from the first leg. Deportivo la Coruna, Barcelona, Roma and Liverpool have recovered from three-goal deficits in the Champions League ahead of a second leg to go through. United have also lost 3-0 at home six times since the start of last season but Athletic are up against it.",
      "Hint at final XI?",
      "At the risk of getting ahead of ourselves, United's line-up for the final could already be pencilled in. With Matthijs de Ligt sidelined again, Noussair Mazraoui would be the logical inclusion in the back three. Amad's return and impact on the right wing against Brentford makes him a natural fit.",
      "Debuts?",
      "This could be as serene a semi-final second leg for United as it was against Schalke in the Champions League in 2011. They were 2-0 up from the first leg that night and won the second 4-1.",
      "More academy players trained with the first team on Wednesday. Jaydan Kamason has been an unused substitute in a few European ties already while Bendito Mantato was on the bench in Bilbao.",
      "Bodo or Spurs?",
      "Anyone in the press box tonight would be forgiven for having a live feed of the other semi-final on their smartphone. Tottenham players are dropping like flies, they will be playing on a plastic pitch and Bodo got a late goal to ensure they avoided a three-goal defeat. That tie does not feel like a foregone conclusion as much as United's.",
      "New tifo",
      "United's progression to the final seems such a certainty a genuine thing to look out for is the second Old Trafford tifo. They picked the right night for the unveiling of the first ahead of that uproarious epic with Lyon three weeks ago and United supporters appeared to approve."

      "Manchester United will be hoping to seal their place in the Europa League final when they welcome Athletic Bilbao to Old Trafford on Thursday evening for their semi-final second leg.",
      "United are 3-0 up on aggregate following last week's first leg in Spain, meaning they are in a commanding position to book their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim shuffled his pack for Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford in the Premier League, meaning he is poised to revert to a similar XI to the one that started last Thursday's first leg at the San Mames Stadium.",
      "Regarding the team news, Amorim has confirmed Matthijs de Ligt will be unavailable for the next two games after suffering a suspected knee injury against Brentford. He also confirmed that he does not anticipate any fresh faces to be back in the squad.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up tonight:",
      "United should play the team that can be pencilled in for the final tonight. With De Ligt out, Noussair Mazraoui is a logical choice at right centre back while Amad is a natural fit for the right wing. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro is the established midfield pairing for the meaningful matches in the run-in, while the three forward positions are also locked in, irrespective of their domestic form.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the main man who would miss out but his absence is not particularly glaring, given recent selections.",
      "This will be a very strong United team and arguably the one that starts the final, although that could change if either De Ligt or Dalot prove their fitness or Amorim decides he wants the left-foot of Shaw in defence. For now, Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro are the back three.",
      "This is the ideal opportunity to give Amad an hour at right wing-back after he got 45 minutes at Brentford. Shaw could replace him during the game with Mazraoui moving to wing-back. Dorgu starts on the left and would be a certainty for the final. Ugarte and Casemiro have formed a good partnership in the deep midfield positions in the Europa League.",
      "Further forward, Fernandes and Garnacho have also created a good dynamic in the No.10 roles and they can start behind Hojlund, who has saved his best performances for Europe.",
      "Having blitzed Bilbao in the San Mames a week ago, Amorim must be feeling tempted to name the exact same starting XI. He made eight changes at Brentford on Sunday and that was done with a firm eye on tonight's game.",
      "However, with De Ligt sidelined and Victor Lindelof set to move on at the end of the season, it makes sense for Mazraoui to start at right-sided centre-back and open up the door for Amad to bag his first start since February.",
      "He has stepped off the bench in each of the last two games and the prospect of him starting against Athletic would give the crowd an even bigger lift ahead of kick-off. The Ivorian excelled as a wing-back earlier this season, and with United 3-0 up in the tie, Amorim may be more confident in unleashing an attack-minded wing-back from the start."

      "Inzaghi might just be the most under-appreciated coach in Europe, and steering this ageing Inter side to another shot at the European Cup is a remarkable triumph. Matteo Darmian still gets games on a regular basis, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan is a key man in midfield at 36.",

      "Kean has bagged 23 goals in 41 appearances for the Serie A club as his side push to qualify for the Conference League final.",
      "United are on the lookout for a striker to bolster their attack and £34m would be considered a reasonable fee that the club would be willing to spend.",
      "However, a swap deal which sees Hojlund go in the opposite direction is unlikely.",
      "This is because swap deals are considered to be counter-intuitive when it comes to improving a club's Financial Fair Play (FFP) balance sheet.",
      "That does not mean that Vlahovic won't join United with Hojlund moving to Turin but those two deals will be independent of one another.",
      "According to Tuttosport, Juve have taken the next step towards signing Hojlund this summer by putting a price tag on Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "It is claimed the Turin club want £34m for Vlahovic who has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season.",
      "Vlahovic is reportedly uninterested in signing a new contract on a lower wage with the Serie A giants and therefore the club are looking to sell him.",
      "If they do, it is claimed that United's Hojlund is on their radar as his replacement with talks having already commenced, according to reports.",
      "According to the Daily Star, Chelsea are ready to renew their interest in Garnacho this summer having fallen short in January for the winger.",
      "However, United are looking to negotiate hard if they are to allow him to leave the club.",
      "It is understood that Ineos are looking to receive an offer in the region of £65m before considering selling the winger.",
      "When asked about his future at United, Garnacho responded that he is happy to be at the club despite the speculation surrounding him.",
      "He told reporters:",
      "Obviously as a footballer you are always going to read and listen to some rumours about the future. But I have a contract here until 2028, so I’m happy here.",
      "Chelsea have been heavily linked with a move for Garnacho while a return to Atletico Madrid has also been suggested as a possibility.",
      "Nobody in United red will be underestimating the importance of Thursday night for the context of the club's season.",
      "However, winning the Europa League is more than just qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "It also provides United with the platform to compete with the likes of Newcastle in the transfer market as they look likely to be able to offer Champions League football.",
      "Newcastle will feel that if United are outside Europe, they will have the edge over them to sign Tah - should it be a straight battle between the two clubs.",
      "A move to Old Trafford is guaranteed to be more appealing if the Champions League is also on the agenda for Amorim's side and Ineos will know that...",
      "Speaking ahead of the Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, Amorim has addressed reports that Al Hilal are ready to bid for his captain.",
      "He told reporters at Carrington:",
      "I think it is easy to understand that [transfer speculation], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays. He is a top player and we need top players. He is a leader, the captain. It is natural that people want Bruno, but we want to keep him. He is one of the top players of the world.",
      "Speaking in April, the defender confirmed that Bayer Leverkusen were aware of his desire to leave the club at the end of this season.",
      "He told Kicker:",
      "Yes. Yes, definitely [I will leave Bayer Leverkusen]. I don’t have a timeframe, to be honest. But the club knows about it. And I’ve been very open with them, as I always have been. Everything was said at the start. There was a point when I made the decision not to extend my contract and not to stay here. And that’s how it’s going to go now."

      "Manchester United are on the verge of the Europa League final as they prepare to take on Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final second leg.",
      "United sit in a comfortable position heading into Thursday night's return leg at Old Trafford after beating the La Liga club 3-0 at the San Mames Stadium. Casemiro opened the scoring on the half-hour mark before the game changed firmly in United's favour when Dani Vivian was sent off for the denial of a goalscoring opportunity in the penalty area.",
      "Bruno Fernandes comfortably slotted home the spot kick and then made sure of the result before half-time when he broke through the host's defence to win the game. United know that at least a defeat by no more than two goals will be enough to progress to the final of the competition where either Tottenham Hotspur or Bodo/Glimt shall await.",
      "So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at how you can get your tickets for the Europa League final should United get the job done tonight.",
      "The final will take place at a familiar arena for United, the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao. The Basque club will host the final on Wednesday, May 21, at 8pm UK time.",
      "Both teams in the final will receive an allocation of roughly 14,500 tickets for the final despite San Mames boasting a capacity of 53,000. Roughly 24,000 tickets will be given to sponsors or have already been secured by neutrals.",
      "UEFA's official website confirms that fans could apply for tickets before April 11. This ballot has since closed and those who applied will be finding out whether they were successful or not shortly.",
      "It is understood that UEFA will be handling the purchasing of the tickets for the final rather than United. Further details will be announced in due course.",
      "The roughly 14,500 tickets that United shall receive for the final will cost £34.32. However, Category One tickets will cost £205.91, up from £128.70 the year prior.",
      "There is believed to be some restricted view tickets in Category One that will be priced at £161.10."

      "Manchester United will be hoping to reach the Europa League final when they host Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their semi-final showdown at Old Trafford on Thursday evening.",
      "United are in a commanding position to reach their first European final in eight years after winning last week's first leg 3-0 at the San Mames Stadium. Capitalising on a numerical advantage, the Reds got the job done via goals from Bruno Fernandes (2) and Casemiro.",
      "It means the Reds will be hoping to finish the job without too much fuss and book another visit to Bilbao later this month, with Tottenham Hotspur currently poised to meet them in the final.",
      "Ahead of the clash with Ernesto Valverde's side, United head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed he will be without Matthijs de Ligt through injury. The Dutchman suffered a suspected knee issue in Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford.",
      "However, the United boss did not report any other fresh concerns, meaning he looks set to pick from the same pool of players that were available for last week's first leg in Spain.",
      "After being rested against Brentford, Andre Onana is poised to return in goal at Altay Bayindir's expense. The Cameroonian will be targeting back-to-back clean sheets in the Europa League for the first time this season after keeping Athletic at bay last week.",
      "With De Ligt unavailable, Amorim could revert to the same back-three that started in the Basque Country a week ago, meaning recalls for Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Victor Lindelof.",
      "Maguire started in the centre of the trio last week with Lindelof to his right and Yoro to his left. All three players stepped off the bench against Brentford.",

      "Casemiro was excellent in the Basque Country last week and should return to the engine room after being given a breather at the weekend. Manuel Ugarte should occupy the other central-midfield berth, meaning United could start with the same midfield partnership for the fourth Europa League game running.",
      "In attack, Amorim is likely to maintain the theme of sticking with the same XI that started the first leg against Athletic, meaning Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund are set to be reinstated to the front-three alongside Alejandro Garnacho, who started and scored against Brentford. Amad should be eased back in after returning on Sunday.",
      "Both Fernandes and Hojlund were unused substitutes on Sunday, meaning they should be fully refreshed to start and strengthen United's chances of reaching the Europa League final.",
      "United predicted XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Lindelof; Mazraoui, Casemiro, Ugarte, Dorgu; Garnacho, Fernandes; Hojlund.",

      "Manchester United have seen a decline in their valuation after a brutal year of cuts and challenging on-pitch performances.",
      "United, who currently sit fifth from bottom in the Premier League but could feasibly finish the season one place above the relegation zone, still remain second on the annual soccer valuations list, published by US sports business outlet Sportico.",
      "Only behind the $6.53bn (£4.9bn) of Spanish giants Real Madrid, United’s valuation is pegged at $6.09bn (£4.5bn), a decline of 2% year on year, something that has seen Real Madrid leapfrog the Red Devils, who last year held a valuation of $6.2bn (£4.65bn) into first place.",
      "Back in December 2023, British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe closed on a deal with the controlling Glazer family for 27.7% of the club, and oversight over matters of football strategy, for a sum of $1.6bn (£1.2bn). Since then Ratcliffe, the founder of chemicals firm INEOS, has been in charge of changing the culture and direction of the club, including the plans for a new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "But against the backdrop of making some 250 redundancies at the club, United have failed miserably on the pitch, although there could well be a reprieve this season with the club having one foot in the Europa League final. A win in that competition would secure Champions League football next season, something that would deliver lucrative revenue for the club, and that would likely see the valuation rise in 12 months time.",
      "For some time now, the valuations of Premier League sides have been on an incline, buoyed by a strong broadcast rights deal that has separated English football’s top flight from its global rivals, although there has been some stagnation in terms of domestic rights, but hopes for international rights growth remains strong.",
      "Despite the struggles on the pitch, which have been a running theme for some seasons now, United’s brand strength both at home and abroad, where they have solidified their position as a sporting powerhouse globally thanks to their ability to leverage the success they had in the 1990s and 2000s to early 2010s, have ensured that the commercial strength has remained strong, and that has enabled them to realise significant gains in terms of how much the club has been worth.",
      "The controversial and much derided ownership of the Glazers has been a huge bone of contention for United fans down the years. The American owners acquired the club in 2005 via a leveraged buyout, and they have proceeded to take dividends out of the club while heaping huge amounts of debt on its balance sheet. They acquired the club at a valuation of £790m in 2005, with the 20 years since they arrived having seen that valuation grow by £3.71bn, a rise of a staggering 470%.",
      "The decline year on year won’t be of much concern to the Glazers on that front, with the club still ahead of Liverpool (£4.19bn), Manchester City (£3.87bn), and Arsenal (£3.37bn). However, continued poor performance on the pitch and a longer-term lack of exposure to the Champions League will have the potential to have a negative impact on valuation."

      "Mantato travelled to the Basque Country to be named on the bench against Athletic Bilbao last week, and he was absent from the Under-21 squad to face West Ham on Bank Holiday Monday because he was required to be part of the first-team's preparations for the second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "Mantato formerly played at left-back in academy fixtures, but he gradually progressed to predominantly play on the right wing and his style has already led to comparisons with Bukayo Saka, who also started his career as a defender before developing into an attacking player.",
      "The youngster's quality in attacking and defensive scenarios means he has the ideal profile to play at wing-back in Amorim's system, and he is now pushing towards making a senior debut.",
      "Only the most highly rated talents in the academy are given a professional contract at 17 and Mantato is included in that bracket. Premier League clubs Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Brighton showed an interest in signing Mantato last year, but he has been tied down at United."

      "The woeful form of the three promoted sides has ensured that is a fate they have escaped but Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford was the 16th loss of the season in 35 Premier League games and United sit 15th in the table.",
      "Their form in Europe has been a dramatic contrast. Their 3-0 win in Bilbao last week giving them a handy advantage over Athletic Club in the Europa League semi-final and they remain unbeaten in 13 games in this competition this season.",
      "Barring disaster at Old Trafford on Thursday, they will return to Bilbao for the Europa League final on May 21, when victory will deliver not only a European trophy, but a route back into the Champions League, not that that will change Amorim's views on a disappointing season.",
      "\"I think you have to see the quote in the moment, so things can change. For me, in that moment, if you look at the Premier League I think since I arrived we are the worst team in terms of results in Premier League,\" he said.",
      "\"At the end of the season we can be the worst team in Premier League in history with a European title, so it will not change anything. We know this season was really disappointing for everybody, nothing is going to change [that]. I felt that and still feel that this season was the worst, I don’t say in history but for sure in the last 50 years.\"",
      "Amorim also played down Arsene Wenger's recent suggestion that UEFA should rewrite their rules to stop the winners of the Europa League automatically qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "If Tottenham hold on to their 3-1 advantage to beat Bodo/Glimt on Thursday then it will be an all-Premier League Europa League final between the teams currently 15th and 16th in England's top flight, but one of them would secure backdoor entry to Europe's premier club competition.",
      "\"I just know the rules. If people want to change the rules by all means but these are the rules, if you win Europa League you go to Champions League, so we follow the rules,\" said Amorim.,",
      "\"I know the Champions League should be for teams who are champions or the best teams in the league but they find this way of promoting the competition so we just follow the rules and manage the end of the season with that. We cannot go by the Premier League, so we follow the rules and go for it for the Europa League.\""

      "Overcoming their opposition has now seemingly become even harder with a second huge injury blow confirmed by Postecoglou before their second leg. In the 3-1 victory last Thursday, Dominic Solanke and James Maddison both picked up injuries with the latter's issue being much more serious.",
      "\"Madders from the first leg,\" Postecoglou said when asked for the latest team news. \"So he's out. He'll miss the rest of this season and disappointing for him. I'm disappointed for him because he's been a real catalyst for us. He'll miss out but that's been the story of our season.",
      "\"Everyone else from the first leg has travelled and they're ready to go. Dom is fine and ready to go, he's trained with the team.\"",
      "Lucas Bergvall was already ruled out for the season prior to the first leg due to ankle injury picked up in training. With Maddison joining him in the treatment room, that is two key absences Spurs will have to deal with if they are able to reach the final in Bilbao.",
      "Son Heung-min is also dealing with an issue and it is currently unclear when he could return. No [he hasn't travelled],\" Postecoglou said. \"Disappointing for Sonny. He has progressed and he's a possibility to get minutes at the weekend but he hasn't trained with the team yet.",
      "As for United, Amorim has received a mixed bag on the injury front as of late with the return of Amad coming alongside Diogo Dalot and Matthijs de Ligt suffering new problems.",
      "\"It is not a big issue, so that is a good thing,\" Amorim said on the latter. But he cannot play tomorrow and on Sunday [vs West Ham]. But then we will check day-by-day and see.\""

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure.",
      "Harry Maguire was the hero against Lyon while Rasmus Hojlund did sweet f-all once again. Here are ten reasons Amorim should start the centre-back up top for Man Utd."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "It’s claimed ‘sources close to the player indicate early-stage talks have already begun ahead of the summer window’, but in what will be a significant blow to Manchester United, ‘a loan deal is seen as the most realistic path’.",
      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",

Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",

      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "In 2014, Neville and fellow Class of ’92 members Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt bought non-league side Salford City as part of a consortium which included businessman Peter Lim.",
      "Neville and Co. oversaw a rapid rise as Salford City earned four promotions in five years to reach League Two, but the club has stagnated in recent seasons.",

      "Now, Salford chiefs have recognised that changes are necessary, with The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealing Neville and Beckham are part of a ‘new consortium’ in control of the club.",
      "His report confirms Butt, Giggs, Neville and Scholes have ‘relinquished their stakes, but will continue to occupy various positions at Moor Lane’.",
      "It is noted that Neville and Beckham have been ‘seeking investment partners’ since Lim’s exit from Salford City in 2024 and they ‘plan on lifting the club to new heights’ amid their ‘commitment to injecting significant funds’.",

      "After ‘considering multi-club models and a direct owner’, Neville and Beckham ‘decided to join forces with Declan Kelly, founder of U.S.-based advisory firm Consello, and Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association’, who ‘will co-chair Salford’s board of directors’.",
      "Regarding Salford City’s Championship plans, the report adds:",
      "‘The collective are believed to have raised around $15-20million [approx £15m at most] to boost Salford’s sporting and infrastructural ambitions over the next five years. Inside that timeframe they are targeting promotion to the Championship.",
      "‘Each member will hold a 5 per cent or 10 per cent stake, totalling at 80 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent has been earmarked for additional partners.",
      "‘None of them will have day-to-day involvement — interviews are taking place to appoint a chief executive and that person will drive matters on the ground — but their influence is set to be felt across the operation.’",
      "Gary Neville reckons it won’t be long before Harry Kane is back in the Premier League with Chelsea and Liverpool looking for a striker this summer.",

      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",

      "",
      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",
      "",
      "26) Ben Dawson, Leicester, November-December (24)\nLeft Newcastle in the summer after 15 years in various academy and age-group coaching roles for a job on Steve Cooper’s coaching team at Leicester. Might have been an error. Named caretaker following Cooper’s departure, he oversaw a 4-1 defeat at Brentford before handing the reins to Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "",
      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",
      "What we do know for certain is that O’Neil will get the job on the back of some fine video screen analysis and Speaking Well, I Thought on Monday Night Football.",
      "",
      "24) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Leicester, December onwards (21)\nA fun little bit from this season has been Ruud van Nistelrooy being at the heart of both the best and worst bits of decision-making all season long.",
      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",
      "READ: Ranking this season’s Premier League managerial changes from Vitor to Ruud",
      "",
      "23) Sean Dyche, Everton, August-January (20)\nThe last manager rankings were compiled just days before Everton gave Dyche the Spanish Archer, and if you’ll indulge us we would like to revel in this rare example of us having got the situation pretty much spot on.",
      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",
      "He really did have them in a full-blown relegation scrap, in this Premier League season of all Premier League seasons, and wasn’t even going about it in entertaining fashion.",
      "",
      "22) Steve Cooper, Leicester August-November (22)\n‘Nobody is currently talking about Steve Cooper’ we chirped in November. Turns out we just weren’t listening. He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",
      "",
      "20) Kieran McKenna, Ipswich (7)\nSeventh? Ahem. Sorry about that. A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",
      "Luton remain the warning from history there, but for now McKenna has just about emerged from this season with reputation intact if not perhaps enhanced in the way he might have hoped or expected.",
      "",
      "19) Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham (19)\nOne of two potential absolute noodle-scratchers when the final rankings are put together a month from now.",
      "But while it is Ruben Amorim who insists winning the Europa League cannot save United’s season, it’s really Postecoglou for whom it feels more of a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",
      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",
      "",
      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",
      "",
      "17) Simon Rusk, Southampton, December and April onwards (17)\nHis two brief interim stints have delivered over 18 per cent of Southampton’s Premier League points this season and 50 per cent of their clean sheets in 13 per cent of their games, thus making Rusk – stopgap between Russell Martin’s egocentric Kompany-lite stylings and whatever it is Ivan Juric was attempting to achieve and now between Juric and whatever comes next – comfortably Southampton’s most impressive manager of the season.",
      "Had Rusk been manager for the whole season it is a clear statistical certainty that they would now have 15 points and left Derby for dust. Undeniable facts.",
      "",
      "16) Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, Everton, January (NE)\nOne hundred per cent record after a 2-0 FA Cup third-round win over League One strugglers Peterborough in a sole game in charge before David Moyes’ glorious return, you’ll never sing that.",
      "",
      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nThis is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing. Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",
      "Liverpool have a trophy. Newcastle have a trophy. Chelsea will probably have a trophy. Man City will probably have a trophy. And most humiliatingly of all, either Spurs or Man United will almost certainly have a trophy.",
      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",
      "It is not easy, this season has provided more questions than answers and exposed some familiar failings.",
      "",
      "14) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Man United, October-November (10)\nYeah, that genuinely went brilliantly well. Credit to everyone here. If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",
      "",
      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",
      "But none of that will matter at all if Glasner can become the first Crystal Palace manager to win a major honour in the FA Cup final against a Man City side who despite recent improvements remain distinctly vulnerable.",
      "",
      "12) Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton (11)\nLook, this is probably still more of a Brighton thing than a Hurzeler thing but at some point they are simply going to have to decide whether they are any good or not. Until they make up their minds about this, how on earth are any of the rest of us supposed to do so?",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",
      "",
      "10) David Moyes, Everton, January onwards (NE)\nPretty mad that we haven’t actually done an update since Moyes’ glorious homecoming to Everton, but it’s been one of the division’s more compelling good-news stories this year.",
      "The new-manager bounce is a real and unignorable phenomenon, but rarely have its effects been more pronounced than during that five-game, 13-point run just after Moyes’ came back to Goodison after 10 often difficult years away.",
      "The whole mood of the club was utterly transformed as the dread fear of relegation and losing that cherished and tightly held top-flight status just before moving into their stunning new ground gripped Everton fans.",
      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",
      "But there remain few guarantees about how it will all pan out.",
      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",
      "",
      "7) Marco Silva, Fulham (8)\nHis side just seem to have run out of puff a bit since the international break, and that’s a shame because until then Fulham appeared to have a very plausible chance to do something extraordinary.",
      "They have even in a weary phase that has delivered a crushing FA Cup defeat and four losses in six Premier League games still managed a thrilling win over Liverpool when that was still at least theoretically meaningful to all concerned.",
      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",

      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira, Wolves, December onwards (12)\nHas triggered an astonishing transformation in Wolves’ fortunes given the mess he inherited from Gary O’Neil.",
      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",
      "And as we’ve noted before: imagine the coverage both Pereira and O’Neil would be getting now had their stories this season been reversed.",
      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Did Arsenal make a ‘sack decision’ on Mikel Arteta within an hour of the final whistle in Paris? It seems unlikely.",
      "Is the ‘public glee’ at Arsenal’s defeat to PSG down to their manager Arteta and his nonsense excuses? The Gunners boss is ‘openly disliked by staff’.",
      "Presenter Gary Lineker has suggested that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta’s decision against Paris Saint-Germain proves he doesn’t trust one of his players.",
      "The entire Arsenal squad has now been fully indoctrinated by Mikel Arteta and his ‘woe is me’ schtick. Declan Rice is now just making stuff up to excuse failure.",
      "Mikel Arteta gets a massive kicking after Arsenal came up short once again. Is this just Handsome Man Syndrome in the extreme?"

The subsequent scorched-earth policy over Alexander-Arnold could engulf murals, statues and even the official end date of his Liverpool contract.",

They stressed that Alexander-Arnold will leave ‘once his deal ceases on June 30, 2025,’ four days after the Spanish side’s final group game.",

Bournemouth are unlikely to stand in the way of the centre-half – and a £50m release clause renders that largely out of their hands anyway – and they might not mind if Chelsea’s desperation prevents a summer-long auction.",

      "Yet the idea of Felix will forever entice sporting directors with more money than sense, so of course both Flamengo and Benfica have been linked with either a loan or a permanent move which would ideally be put in place in June, and probably lead to Chelsea being stunned that the Portuguese is under contract with them for another six years.",

      "The Saudi giants had previously set aside funds to move for Mohamed Salah, but after the Egyptian signed a new Liverpool deal, their focus has shifted to the Manchester United captain.",
      "They reportedly have a staggering £510million to spend on a marquee signing, with £170million per season earmarked for wages alone.",

      "However, there are conflicting claims around a potential £60m release clause in Fernandes’ contract. While some reports suggest such a clause exists, United have been quick to ‘downplay this’, insisting no official release clause is in place.",
      "That said, Al Hilal reportedly ‘understand there to be a threshold’ – an informal price point – ‘above which United would be willing to negotiate, particularly if the player expresses a desire to leave Old Trafford’.",
      "The report also states that Fernandes’ representatives have been in ‘contact since the summer of 2024’ with Al Hilal over a potential move to the Middle East.",
      "A ‘non-binding offer’ has already been tabled, with a three-year contract on the cards. So far, Fernandes ‘is yet to respond’.",

      "Man Utd have opened talks with Serie A side Torino over a possible move for their highly-rated goalkeeper, as the club begin exploring replacements for Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano on GiveMeSport, Man Utd have made “initial contacts” over a deal for the 6ft 8in Torino shot-stopper, who is expected to leave Italy this summer following a standout season under Paolo Vanoli. Romano wrote:",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "Milinkovic-Savic, 28, is no stranger to Old Trafford. He was originally signed by the club back in 2014, only to be released shortly after when work permit issues prevented the then-teenager from featuring in England. A decade on, United are circling once again.",
      "Utd’s goalkeeping department has become a growing concern for head coach Ruben Amorim, with Onana’s form collapsing since the Portuguese manager took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "The Cameroonian started the season in strong form under Ten Hag, keeping Utd competitive through a turbulent opening two months, but has since suffered a sharp and public decline.",
      "A string of high-profile errors, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping Onana from the starting XI in recent weeks.",
      "His understudy, Altay Bayindir, has failed to convince either. The Turkish international looked uncertain when called upon, and sources indicate the 26-year-old may look to leave this summer in pursuit of more regular first-team football",
      "According to Bayindir’s agent, Utd rejected advances for the goalkeeper in the previous window, but not it seems the club may be more open to a sale this time around.",
      "As a result, Utd have accelerated their search for a new goalkeeper — a position that had initially been seen as a secondary concern this window, behind the club’s urgent need for attacking reinforcements and a midfield overhaul.",
      "Torino’s Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a credible alternative to Espanyol’s Joan Garcia, who is also being closely monitored.",
      "Garcia has impressed in La Liga and has a release clause in the £20–25 million range, but Utd would face competition from the likes of Arsenal.",
      "Milinkovic-Savic, on the other hand, is viewed as a more accessible option. He has reportedly expressed interest in returning to Manchester, and his commanding presence, leadership, and form this season have turned heads across Europe.",
      "Despite not being the highest priority on Amorim’s long summer to-do list, the goalkeeping situation remains unresolved.",
      "The decision now rests on Torino’s valuation and Utd’s willingness to act.",

      "Wayne Rooney has hailed Harry Kane as “England’s greatest striker,” backing the Bayern Munich man as the Premier League’s finest ever number nine and insisting he should still go on to break Alan Shearer’s long-standing goalscoring record if he returns to English football.",
      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",
      "But Rooney didn’t stop there, he doubled down on his belief that Kane is already the Englands best-ever frontman.",
      "“I think he’s England’s greatest striker. Just the goals he’s scored, firstly. But then you look at the games he’s played, the goals he’s scored, he’s just… You just hope. He’s probably got one tournament left in him. You hope he can push us now to that next level.”",
      "Kane’s role for England and his tendency to drop deep drew analysis, too, with Rooney acknowledging that tactical tweaks may have blunted the Three Lions’ attack in past tournaments.",
      "“In the last Euros, you had Harry coming in, you had Bellingham coming in, and they were taking up each other’s space. As a team, Harry should’ve recognised that and said, ‘No, I’m going to play up top.’ At times, you have to do that.”",

Dembele draws level with 2024 champ Gyokeres\nRooney, who scored 208 Premier League goals himself and remains Utd’s all-time top scorer, didn’t just talk about Kane. He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",
      "“You’ve lost natural number nines. I think Isak, Haaland, and Watkins, probably the three standout ones. Rashford’s doing better now, too. But beyond that? Not many.”",
      "Asked who he’d pick as a manager if he needed one striker right now, Rooney was clear. “Haaland. As good as Isak’s been, I think Haaland’s got everything. He’s not the best at heading, his timing’s a bit off, but the goals he’s scored even this season, with injuries, I’d want him.”",
      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",
      "“I always say Drogba. He could head the ball, hold it up, and he was quick, powerful. You could play off him. That’s the kind of striker I liked.”",
      "He added, “Michael Owen (Liverpool) was unplayable for a few years. Ronaldo, R9, had everything. Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Owen, Sergio Aguero, Thierry Henry… they were incredible. But Kane, for sustainability and goals scored? He’s right up there.”",

      "The obvious option with their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain is an inability to overcome that first-leg deficit at the Parc des Princes. That in itself presents different avenues: the glorious failure of a high-scoring draw; a heart-breaking penalty shoot-out defeat after doing the hard part; losing and never even coming close in an anti-climactic exit.",
      "But it might be best to look beyond that and take a more holistic approach. Arsenal beating PSG before losing the final in crushing fashion is fundamentally funnier, granting the more chronically online elements of the fanbase an opportunity to crow and gloat before placing them back into their comfort zone of shouting into microphones on YouTube and demanding human sacrifices be made live on an altar at the Emirates.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 12:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""

      "",
      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",
      "Brentford:  Flekken (6), Kayode (8), Collins (6), Van den Berg (6), Lewis-Potter (6), Norgaard (7), Yarmoliuk (7), Mbeumo (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (9), Wissa (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Jensen (6), Henry (6), Ajer (n/a), Nunes (n/a), Thiago (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd:  Bayindir (6), Fredricson (5), De Ligt (6), Shaw (4), Dorgu (5), Ugarte (7), Mainoo (6), Amass (6), Mount (7), Garnacho (8), Obi (5).\n\n\nSubs used:  Maguire (6), Yoro (6), Diallo (7), Eriksen (7), Lindelof (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kevin Schade.",
      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
