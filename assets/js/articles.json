      "Erik ten Hag's long-term future at Manchester United will be determined in the summer - but whether or not he stays at Old Trafford will not be decided by Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "Manchester United's incoming chief executive Omar Berrada will ultimately be the person who decides whether or not Erik ten Hag will remain in his post next season, it has emerged.",
      "Berrada has a wealth of expertise after filling the role of chief football operating officer at Manchester City and is poised to head up football operations at Old Trafford once he officially starts his new role in the summer following a period of gardening leave.",
      "Plundering Berrada from City was Sir Jim Ratcliffe's first major coup since acquiring a 27.7 per cent stake in his boyhood club from the Glazers, but the Ineos chief is likely to make further moves in an attempt to enhance United's operations. Dan Ashworth is expected to join the club as sporting director once an agreement for his services is reached with Newcastle, but there is still no clarity over the future of the man currently leading United on the pitch.",
      "Despite impressing during his maiden season, Ten Hag has overseen an underwhelming 2023/24 campaign. His fate will be decided by Berrada, though, rather than Ratcliffe himself, according to the Manchester Evening News.",
      "It's outlined that Ratcliffe is happy to delegate the decision-making process over Ten Hag's future to Berrada given his 'football expertise'. It's also noted that the Dutchman is now likely to see the season out after reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup.",
      "Ten Hag signed a three-year contract with the Red Devils in the summer of 2022 after leaving Ajax, meaning he is contracted to continue in his role for the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "However, speculation over his long-term future has only intensified since the arrival of Ratcliffe and co, with the British billionaire failing to publicly endorse United's current chief.",
      "Despite an underwhelming season, Ten Hag insisted United are still on course for a bright future and pointed to injuries as a mitigating factor behind their poor form. Speaking at the start of the month, he said: \"No team can deal with this, with so many injuries. I think we are playing to maximum levels if you take in the availability of the players.",
      "\"So, when you miss so many key players over many parts of the season, then obviously the results, the performances will not be (the same as) when the players are available.",
      "\"We have seen when the players were available like in January and February our performances were very good. And I think from that moment when the players were not even fit, they could have done even better when they are 100 per cent fit in that moment but they were not.\"",

      "Bob Wilson is an Arsenal legend who will forever remember the gestures made by Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson after the deaths of his daughter and his wife",
      "The moments where Sir Alex Ferguson showcased his class still remain with Arsenal great Bob Wilson as he dealt with personal grief.",
      "The legendary goalkeeper made more than 300 appearances for the Gunners, later becoming a coach with the north Londoners - a role he would hold for 28 years before calling it a day in 2003. During that latter part of that lengthy spell Arsenal had become embroiled in a fierce rivalry with Manchester United.",
      "Arsenal were the only club to challenge United's authority and, as a results, Ferguson and Arsene Wenger had their moments - as did the players on the pitch. Nevertheless, Ferguson knew where to leave the rivalry and his human side left its mark on Wilson after the passing of his wife, Megs, whom he'd been with for 70 years.",
      "The Gunners dedicated a page to Wilson's wife in a matchday programme with Ferguson among those present at her recent Memorial Service at a full St Albans Cathedral.",
      "Wilson told the Telegraph: “It showed Arsenal’s class. Alex [Ferguson] drove four hours, came to the service, went back. I made sure Frank McLintock and George Graham were right by him. I got a message two days after from a close friend who said, ‘There were these three Scottish blokes in the row behind me and I gather one of them is very famous. Well, my husband and I could not understand one word they said!’”",
      "Ferguson had also taken the time out to phone Wilson back in 1998 when their daughter, Anna, died of cancer at the tragic age of 31. That was during United's treble winning season, in which Arsenal were their main rivals in the Premier League and the FA Cup.",
      "Wilson recalled: “Three nights after Anna died, the phone rang. ‘Hiya Bob, it’s Alex’. I was, ‘Alex??’ He was, ‘Yeah, Alex Ferguson ’. He spoke to me, said, ‘You sound as if you are holding up but where’s Megs?’ He then spoke to her for 20 minutes. I’ll never forget that.”",
      "Anna's death led to the beginning of their Willow Foundation charity, for which Megs was the driving force. So much so that Wilson initially tuned down his OBE in 2007 because it had not gone to his wife. “I said, ‘You deserve this more’. She went berserk. She said, ‘It’s not just for Willow, it’s what you have done in football’.”",

      "Liverpool Women leapfrogged Manchester United in the Women's Super League table and could influence the outcome of a blistering title race",
      "Going back to the beginning, Liverpool Women have given plenty of forewarning.",
      "Midfielder Miri Taylor consigned juggernauts Arsenal to an opening day defeat in the Women’s Super League with a second-half strike and the significance was profound. Not so much a statement as much as an announcement: Liverpool are here.",
      "Talk of upsetting an entrenched top four have been fevered in the last few seasons but few have managed to gatecrash the established elite as effectively as Liverpool this season. In only their second season in England's top-flight since promotion from the Championship, Liverpool – fuelled by savvy recruitment and Matt Beard’s management – sit fourth in the league, one point above Manchester United and eight points off third-place Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool have defeated United and Arsenal this season and could ultimately dictate the title race if league leaders Chelsea and Manchester City – separated by two goals – aren’t careful.",
      "Indeed, both Chelsea and City are due to face Liverpool before the season’s expiry at Prenton Park as a blistering title race continues.",
      "Following Manchester City's thrashing of Manchester United on Saturday, Gareth Taylor insisted that the title race could go down to the wire with just five games remaining. Yet, one of the most epic title races in recent memory could be decided before if Liverpool have anything to say about it. Last season, Liverpool revelled in victories over Chelsea and City in front of a spirited Prenton Park, both teams stymied by a stubborn and unwavering home defence.",
      "Doing so again will doubtlessly prove a challenge. Liverpool suffered 5-1 defeats to both City and Chelsea in the league this season, succumbing to an onslaught of pressure after early goals and failing to match the energy from their opponents. The campaign’s final throes is where Chelsea, and City, tend to come to searing into life.",
      "Yet, Beard has never shied away from his mission of breaking up the established order and as praise was heaped on his side for getting within touching distance of the top four as Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur had done previously, the Liverpool boss steadfastly insisted that reaching that space was only the beginning.",
      "Liverpool had a golden opportunity on Sunday to bridge the gap to Arsenal in third and expand that between themselves and United. But a drab draw with Everton away at Goodison Park and a lack of quality in the final third meant the Reds have five matches remaining to yield their influence on the fate of the league, including a home clash against United to further stamp their authority.",
      "It’s here the margins still remain. Beard bemoaned the “disappointing” quality of Everton’s Premier League pitch, pointing to the long grass and the Toffees’ commitment to stoking a stuttering tempo as playing a role in the lethargic display.",
      "Whether the perceived marginal injustices will fuel Liverpool come Saturday as they host City remains to be seen. City are in siege mode, 10 WSL victories on the bounce and Khadija Shaw setting a new club record for goals scored. But Liverpool are bidding to be the season’s disruptor and thus far, have cut themselves the convincing figure.",

      "England are aiming to avoid a fourth defeat in five meetings with Belgium in Tuesday's friendly at Wembley, with Adnan Januzaj heavily involved in one of those recent games",
      "England's recent record against Belgium isn't the best, and the Three Lions have often found themselves put to the sword by Premier League players.",
      "Three of the last four meetings between the national teams have gone the way of the Belgians, with Youri Tielemans netting in a 2020 Nations League clash and Eden Hazard on target in the third-place play-off at the 2018 World Cup. Earlier at the tournament in Russia, though, it was Adnan Januzaj who took centre-stage.",
      "Januzaj, 23 at the time, was one year removed from his Manchester United exit when he cut in from the right and curled the ball high into Jordan Pickford's net. The goal ensured Belgium topped their group ahead of England, with both teams going on to reach the semi-finals.",
      "After a disappointing end to his time at Old Trafford, the winger will have wanted to kick on from that World Cup success, but has added just six more Belgium appearances since. Here, Mirror Football looks at what the Brussels-born star has been up to.",
      "After breaking into the United team under David Moyes, Januzaj found chances harder to come by during the reigns of Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho. He spent part of the 2015-16 season on loan at Borussia Dortmund, struggling to get a look in under Thomas Tuchel, before a reunion with Moyes for the following campaign.",
      "A difficult season at the Stadium of Light saw Moyes' Sunderland team relegated, with Januzaj failing to score in his 25 appearances. A permanent move to Real Sociedad followed, though, and his form in San Sebastian was what earned him a spot in Roberto Martinez's World Cup squad.",
      "The England game was the only one in which he featured, remaining on the bench for the remainder of the tournament. He didn't even make it onto the field in the third place game, when goals from Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard earned the Red Devils the bronze medal.",
      "",
      "Januzaj had been brought to Real Sociedad by Eusebio Sacristan, but it was under current boss Imanol Alguacil where he really thrived. The 2019-20 season was his best in front of goal, with eight strikes in all competitions, and none were more important than the final day equaliser at Atletico Madrid which sent La Real into Europe.",
      "\"Januzaj, the day of the Sevilla match, was really injured and had not trained, but he wanted to be called up [against Atletico], and I said no,\" Alguacil said, as translated by Marca. \"You know that, with me, whoever doesn't train does not play.",
      "\"So he then told me that he would not travel to Madrid, and I laughed and joked to [assistant coach] Labaka: 'Look at this guy, he says he is not going to travel to Madrid, and he will, and he will end up taking us to Europe.' In the end he travelled, played injured and scored the goal that got us into Europe.\"",
      "That Europa League campaign brought a reunion with former club Manchester United. Alguacil's side finished second in their group behind Napoli, setting up a play-off round meeting with United after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team could only muster third spot in their Champions League group.",
      "Before the game, former United player and coach Paul Scholes acknowledged Januzaj needed to leave Old Trafford to kick-start his career. “The talent no doubt was there. It’s still there, he’s doing really well at Sociedad. I think it’s been a good change for him,\" he told MUTV.",
      "\"He showed glimpses when he first came into United’s first team, that he had the ability that we all knew he had. For some reason it just didn’t work out and he’s had to go elsewhere.\"",
      "Sadly for Real Sociedad, that meeting ended in a comprehensive 4-0 aggregate loss, with United going all the way to the final. Another exit followed at the same stage 12 months later, with RB Leipzig progressing after a win at Anoeta, but an appearance from the bench in that game would represent the last time Januzaj turned out for La Real in European competition.",
      "His contract expired at the end of the 2021-22 season, paving the way for him to join Sevilla in a four-year deal. He barely featured under Julen Lopetegui or Jorge Sampaoli, though, and ended the campaign on loan at Istanbul Basaksehir in search of minutes.",
      "Januzaj's international career has also suffered. The goal against England remains the only one he has scored for his country, and hasn't even earned a call-up since the summer of 2022.",
      "This season has been a tricky one for Sevilla, who are onto their third permanent manager of the season. Januzaj made a late cameo from the bench in current boss Quique Sanchez Flores' first game in charge, but has yet to start in the league since returning from his loan.",
      "“The boys are professionals and each one understands the degree of demand in a different way, but I have to place that demand at a higher level for him and Rafa Mir,\" Sanchez Flores said in February. \"After having gone to them in the times of absolute necessity, there is no time to lower the bar now.",
      "\"Anyone who does not meet that requirement either reaches it, or cannot play. Now things change, it is not enough to be a good professional but you have to have the necessary commitment to defend the Sevilla shirt.”",
      "Januzaj is under contract until 2026, but has played just one minute since those comments from the manager and may well feel his future lies elsewhere. That winner against England feels a long time ago.",

The 13-time Premier League winners currently sit sixth in the table, but it looks increasingly likely that fifth-place will be enough to seal a place in European club football's most prestigious competition.",

The teenager took to Instagram to write: \"Special feeling making my senior England debut at Wembley and in front of my family. A moment I will never forget.

      "Ratcliffe wants United to have a start-of-the-art stadium and will need to either renovate Old Trafford or build an entirely new ground. Speaking on the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast earlier this month, the Ineos chief hinted at plans to increase capacity to 100,000.",
      "\"You have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground, because we have got enough space,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state-of-the-art, world class, 90,000 or maybe even 100,000 that then provides a platform for some of the big competitions in the north of England.",
      "\"Why do England always play in the south? Why is the FA Cup final always in the south? Why can't the Champions League final be in the north occasionally?",
      "\"Football in the north is just as important as it is in the south, arguably more so, and the people in the north pay their taxes, so why do we have Wembley, Twickenham, Wimbledon etc in the south.",
      "\"What have we got in the north? There's a strong argument to build a 'Wembley of the north'.\" And according to a report from the Daily Mail, stadium designers Populous have already come up with proposals to renovate or rebuild Old Trafford.",
      "Populous are said to have been brought in by the Glazers and that the plans they came up with are now being 'scrutinised by Ratcliffe's INEOS people'. A task force was set up earlier this month to explore the club's options, with former United captain Gary Neville, Lord Sebastian Coe and the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham all involved.",
      "And Neville has admitted the \"commercial aspect\" will ultimately be the deciding factor for Ratcliffe. \"I think everyone knows that it's one of two options; either renovate and refurbish the existing Old Trafford or develop a brand new stadium next to Old Trafford,\" he told Sky Sports.",
      "\"Every structural solution is different. Until you get into the meat of the work and see what is really brought forward then I don't think anyone has the answer. That's the reason that the group has been set up, to help answer some of those questions.",

      "However, he has failed to make an impact at Old Trafford and is now in his second loan spell away from the club. Having made just four starts for United in the last two years, Van de Beek joined Frankfurt on loan in January in a bid to get some game time and rediscover his form.",

      "However, Ratcliffe insisted back in February that the rules will not impact United's ability to play in Europe. \"There are no circumstances upon which an ownership of Nice would prevent Manchester United from playing in the Champions League - I'll be crystal clear on that,\" he said.",
      "\"Because we would have to find a solution. The rules are changing, and the rules are shades of grey, not black and white. We have spoken to UEFA and I have to say the conversation wasn't directed at 'you have to solve this problem and we don't like it'.",
      "\"We might have to change some things but what UEFA recognises is that the multi-club model, in many circumstances, benefits the smaller club quite a lot. It says you have to change the ownership structure.",
      "\"So it's all about influence and positions on the board and that sort of thing. So, a) the rules are changing, and, b) there are shades of grey, not black and white. Manchester City will probably have the problem before we have the problem because they've obviously got Girona who are doing well in the Spanish La Liga.\"",

I’m happy I have a good relationship with him, he’s a fantastic kid, I like to be around him.\"",

      "The Dutchman said: “It's very important for him. He struggled so much. First part, he was not himself, he's responsible for that. And then he lost confidence, and now he has to fight back. We see through the last two weeks, he's returning.",
      "“I see in training, I see the Antony I was used to work with at Ajax, and also used to work in the first weeks here. He has to fight back, and I'm sure he will do, because you've seen that goal.",

      "Former Chelsea, Man United and Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has been out of work since leaving Roma in January but is now eyeing a return to football over the next few months",
      "Jose Mourinho is targeting a return to management this summer, just months after his Roma sacking.",
      "The Portuguese head coach left the Italian capital in January after two-and-a-half years at the helm. He had led Roma to the Europa Conference League title during his debut campaign, as well as a place in the Europa League final the following season.",
      "Since then, Mourinho has been linked with a host of roles. A potential move to Saudi Arabia has been reported, while Newcastle and even his former club Chelsea have been touted as potential employers.",
      "While Mourinho has not disclosed a preference for his return, he has claimed he wants to be back in the dugout ahead of next season. Asked at the Moto GP in Portimao, Portugal, if he had received any offers, he replied: “Zero, zero. I don’t have a club, I’m free. But I want to work, in the summer I want to work.”",
      "One option for Mourinho could be a return to Portugal. The 61-year-old has not managed in his home country since ending his glorious spell with Porto ahead of a move to Chelsea in 2004.",
      "Asked if he could work in Portugal, Mourinho said: “Why? Never say no, especially in football. My life is football, I can train anywhere, I have no problems.”",
      "Mourinho’s admission comes just days after Ex-Roma General Manager Tiago Pinto opened up on the decision to sack him. He claimed that the Portuguese’s exit was his toughest call at the Stadio Olimpico.",
      "Where do you think Jose Mourinho will turn up next? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, Pinto said: “Mourinho’s dismissal? That was a very difficult day for everyone. I’m still young, I don’t know if older sports directors manage such situations differently. I die the moment a coach has to be fired. The emotions are too high, it was a collaboration of two and a half years coming to an end.”",
      "Elsewhere, Mourinho appeared to take aim at the Roma hierarchy for the decision to sack him. Talking to Rio Ferdinand two months after his exit, he said: “I’ll be back. I won’t be there for the final stages of the season, not because I’ve been eliminated before, but because I’ve been “eliminated” by someone who has little knowledge of football.”",
      "Roma’s decision to change manager actually looked like being the correct one. They replaced him with iconic former midfielder Daniele De Rossi.",
      "The Italian has won nine out of his 13 matches in all competitions. Roma now sit fifth in Serie A and just three points off of the Champions League places. The club were ninth in the league at the time of Mourinho’s sacking.",

      "The two nations met for a friendly fixture, but Hojlund was reported to have looked like he was 'ready to boil over' by Danish publication BT. The young forward has recently just started to find form in a United shirt after a difficult start to life at Old Trafford following his mega-money move from Serie A side Atalanta in the summer.",
      "Hojlund went his first 14 Premier League games without a goal, before at long last finding the net during the Boxing Day win over Aston Villa. Since then, the Denmark international has barely looked back for his club, boasting seven goals and two assists in the league overall.",
      "With that being said, he struggled to maintain that same form for his national side during this international break. Hojlund didn't even last the full 90 minutes and was withdrawn seven minutes before the full-time whistle, but not before he made his anger clear on the pitch.",
      "Having taken up a number of promising positions throughout the game only to be ignored by his team-mates, the striker is believed to have screamed in fury multiple times. Hojlund wasn't the only United representative on the pitch, with Red Devils midfielder Christian Eriksen also starring for the entire fixture.",
      "Eriksen hasn't had the luxury of featuring for United as much as he'd like recently. Hojlund actually went public with his desire to see his fellow countryman get more time on the pitch at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I myself have sat on the bench for Copenhagen, so I know what that means,\" Hojlund told TV2. \"But he holds his head high and he is a class player. There is absolutely no doubt about that.",

      "\"It was good he got some minutes against Liverpool. I think he did really well when he came on. He is a good player, so you would like to see him on the field, but we have many good players. So it must be the coach’s decision whether he plays or not.\"",

      "Mainoo, 18, who has impressed during his breakthrough campaign at United, earned his first Three Lions call-up last week having initially being named in the Under 21 squad. After being named on the bench, the teenage sensation replaced Conor Gallagher and came on for the final 15 minutes at Wembley.",
      "Despite playing for less than a quarter of the match, Mainoo didn't look out of place and showed the calmness, composure and technical ability he has at his disposal. The United youngster slotted in nicely alongside Rice in central midfield, with Phil Foden ahead of them in the No.10 role.",
      "Reacting to his England debut in an Instagram post, Mainoo said: \"Special feeling making my senior @England debut at Wembley and in front of my family. A moment I will never forget. Now we bounce back and refocus for Tuesday,\" followed by a love heart emoji.",

I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable in the Under-21s, he should be much more dominant.",

      "Ian Wright made his thoughts on Manchester United duo Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof very clear back in September 2020 after a defeat by Crystal Palace and it appears the Red Devils have not heeded his warning",
      "Ian Wright slammed Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof as \"not good enough\" three years ago - but the pair remain at Manchester United.",
      "The Arsenal icon tore into the duo following a disastrous display in a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace in September 2020. Speaking at the time, Wright said: \"They've got to sort out that centre-half pairing, for me. It's not good enough at this level for Man United if they're challenging for stuff. Lindelof and Maguire, not good enough.",
      "\"The fact is, that is not good enough. At this level, with what Man United are supposedly meant to be trying to do, people are talking about Jadon Sancho coming, what's the point?",
      "\"You're going to get Jadon Sancho but still have two centre-halves who got absolutely roasted [against Palace] without actually trying too hard.\"",
      "While Wright was clearly not a fan of the pair, they actually remain at Old Trafford three-and-a-half years later. Maguire remained a key player for the Red Devils throughout the 2020/21 season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "He made 52 appearances for Man United in all competitions as they reached the Europa League final, only to lose out to Spanish side Villarreal. Maguire’s game time dropped the following campaign after the signing of Raphael Varane, while he only started eight Premier League games during Erik ten Hag's first season at the helm.",
      "The ex-Leicester star did however help the Red Devils end their trophy drought as he lifted the Carabao Cup. Things took a turn during Ten Hag’s second campaign.",
      "Maguire was stripped of the captaincy before the season had even started, while West Ham attempted to sign him. The Red Devils even went as far as accepting a £30m offer from the Hammers, but a deal with the defender could not be agreed.",
      "He has since forced himself back into the reckoning at Old Trafford. To date, the 24-year-old has made 24 appearances and won the Premier League Player of the Month award for November.",
      "Elsewhere, Lindelof hasn’t exactly met the heights expected of him since his big-money move from Benfica in 2017. He made 45 appearances the season of Wright’s criticism, with his game time in the Premier League dropping ever since.",
      "The current campaign has actually represented an excellent opportunity for the Swede. With Varane and Lisandro Martinez struggling with injury issues this term, Ten Hag has regularly called upon Lindelof.",
      "He was originally due to be out of contract this summer but an automatic one-year extension in his deal has been activated so it appears that he will stay at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.",

      "Scott McTominay has endured an impressive season at Manchester United and he is set to be rewarded with a new contract, despite Erik ten Hag's willingness to sell last summer",
      "Manchester United have offered Scott McTominay a new long-term contract - less than 12 months after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay, 27, was subject to interest from West Ham last summer and was open to the idea of leaving United in search of regular first-team football. Boss Erik ten Hag had not started McTominay in each of their opening four Premier League matches and his future was looking in doubt.",
      "However, the Scotland international has since performed a remarkable turnaround to become an integral member of the United squad. He has plunged nine goals and grabbed three assists in 34 appearances for the Red Devils this season and is their second top scorer behind striker Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Now, according to the Daily Star, United are set to hand McTominay a new deal as a reward for his uptick in form and performances this term. The midfielder has 15 months left to run on his current £60,000 per-week contract - and the club have an option to extend that by a further year.",
      "There is no urgency for United to tie him down now, but co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is keen to secure McTominay on a longer contract and give him a pay rise, too. The Red Devils are willing to double his salary to £120,000 per-week, which would limit or even stop transfer interest in the summer window.",
      "Before McTominay made his 48th cap for Scotland in their 4-0 defeat against the Netherlands on Friday, he was named as their Player of the Year. That followed a quite stunning Euro 2024 qualifying campaign for the Lancaster-born midfielder, who scored seven goals in eight matches for the Tartan Army.",
      "Speaking after winning the award, McTominay said: \"Obviously, to win something like this, the Scotland men's Player of the Year, is amazing. We've had a good season, in terms of the results we've had and obviously getting to the Euros, and now we want to kick on and do well from here.",
      "\"There were a few [highlights]. I had the goal in Spain that was disallowed and it's probably my favourite ever goal I've not scored! So I'd probably say the other two goals against Spain.",
      "\"It was a historic night for us all, what we want more of them to come hopefully in the future, so we can kick on and show we are capable of beating teams as good as Spain.\"",

      "A LOOK BACK: Manchester United have missed the defensive capabilities of Aaron Wan-Bissaka during his spells out injured, but that's not the only quality he can offer",
      "Manchester United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka is well-known for his defending ability, especially in one-on-one situations, but the right-back once showed his team-mates he can be handy in front of goal when he wants to be.",
      "Wan-Bissaka, signed for £50m from Crystal Palace in 2019, arrived with that lofty reputation - one which many expected him to build on at Old Trafford. There have been moments at which that has been true, but there have also been injury worries - including the hamstring issue which sidelined him early this season and the separate muscular problem which struck in the new year.",
      "The defender returned to action in the FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool, playing 71 minutes of the dramatic extra-time victory. It was his first outing since mid-January, when he completed the full 90 against Spurs in the Premier League.",
      "He has two assists to his name this term, but no goals, and has only scored twice in United colours. Both of those goals came in the 2020-21 season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with one in particular catching the eye of his colleagues.",
      "United made a slow start to the 2020-21 campaign. A controversial late victory at Brighton - with a match-winning penalty awarded after the final whistle - was sandwiched by home defeats against Crystal Palace and Tottenham with an aggregate score of 2-9.",
      "The pressure was mounting when United travelled to Newcastle for their fourth game of the season, and it grew further when a Luke Shaw own goal put the hosts in front. United levelled through Harry Maguire, but it was still 1-1 going into the final five minutes.",
      "It was at this point that Solskjaer's team turned the screw. Three late goals followed, with Fernandes scoring the crucial second, but it was Wan-Bissaka's effort - latching onto a Marcus Rashford pass to blast high into Karl Darlow's net - which really caught the eye.",
      "\"[We were so happy] because we didn't know he can shoot!\" fellow scorer Fernandes told MUTV at the time. \"So it's difficult for us believing he can score because we never see him shooting.",
      "\"We were talking about it now in the dressing room and asking him because we all were thinking he wanted to cross and he makes a bad ball and scores. But I'm happy for him, he deserved the goal and we always ask this from him. Be more positive, be more in the box, try and improve because he has such good qualities.",
      "Despite the goal, the Portuguese demanded more from his colleague. \"Everyone knows about him being a defensive player and everything but he needs to show that he's more than a defensive player and I think he has the qualities to show that,\" he added.",
      "By his own standards, Wan-Bissaka didn't have to wait too much longer for another goal. It came early on against Southampton in February 2021, when he ghosted in at the back post to score the first of nine unanswered goals for United.",
      "He hasn't scored again since, though. Indeed, the next season was less enjoyable for the defender, who found minutes harder to come by, but in 2023 he opened up on how Erik ten Hag's arrival had helped him revive his career at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It can go both ways,\" he told The Mail. \"You can just sit there and complain about it and not care, or you can actually try. I thought the best way was for me to try. It’s obviously never good. But I just had to deal with it. I had support around me, my family, telling me every day, 'Just keep working hard, have faith, your time will come'.",
      "\"So that helped me get through each day. I always have that faith in myself to get myself out of situations like that. I had my head screwed on and I was ready to do what it takes. Probably after January, I felt it I was in the right direction. I felt good about myself. I was happy. I just wanted to keep improving.\"",
      "Back in January, United triggered an option to extend Wan-Bissaka's contract until the summer of 2025. Between now and then, he has a chance to show those displays of finishing ability three seasons ago were no fluke.",

      "Manchester United signed Donny van Beek four years ago but the Dutchman has endured a horror spell at Old Trafford despite comparisons to Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller",
      "Manchester United were told they had a player in the mould of Thomas Muller when they signed Donny van de Beek in 2020.",
      "The Red Devils captured the Ajax playmaker for £40million and saw him score on his debut, albeit in a losing cause. Nevertheless it looked as if the Dutchman's form would quick translate from Amsterdam to Manchester, but that never proved to be the case.",
      "Van de Beek would likely blame his failures at United on his coaches, who have continued to neglect him, issuing him with false promises and creating scenarios that aid him coming up short. The versatile star played as a striker for the exciting Ajax side that made the last four of the Champions League in 2019.",
      "He was equally adept at playing in midfield, much like Muller, who has occupied almost every position in midfield and attack for Bayern during his career. Owen Hargreaves previously heaped praise on Van de Beek, and thought he could've been United's answer to the German, but instead he's now in his second loan spell away as he looks to find form and minutes.",
      "Hargreaves told BT Sport back in 2020: \"I think he's a really good player. He hasn't had the opportunity to show it. He could be like what Thomas Muller is for Bayern Munich - the style. Everybody tried to get Thomas Muller out of the team, but once he's in you can't get him out in terms of goals, assists, he's very unselfish, he can press the ball, he works in a midfield three, he can play as an 8 or a 10.",
      "\"[Van de Beek] is one of those... once he's in the team, Ole is going to find it hard to get him out.The problem you have is: You've got £100m Pogba, Bruno Fernandes... getting them all in one team with the front three they have is going to be a challenge for Ole.\"",
      "The Dutchman ended up starting just four matches in his debut Premier League season - and when he did the spotlight was firmly on him. His fortunes hardly improved the following year but Solskjaer appeared to deflect any blame any from himself.",
      "He said: \"I manage a squad full of international footballers, competitive footballers who want to make a difference, want to play. They all want to be on the pitch, of course they do. I understand the frustration. Every player is keen to play. That's got to be built into energy and some determination for when you get on and then show me. That is not just Donny, that is all the players.\"",
      "Van de Beek would be quick to say he needed opportunities to prove his worth and they continued to elude him. He sat on the bench for the Europa League final defeat and the status quo continued the following season.",
      "He was in the matchday squad for the first 12 games of the season - but got just 61 minutes on the pitch. He came off the bench and scored in a defeat at Watford, which proved to be the last game of the Solskjaer era as results nosedived.",
      "Van de Beek's fortunes failed to improve when Ralf Rangnick came in as interim boss and, at the first chance he got, the midfielder moved away on loan, joining Everton to aid their fight for survival. He started in seven of the nine games he was available for the Toffees, scoring once.",
      "When he returned to Manchester that summer Erik ten Hag had been appointed as the new man in the Old Trafford dugout. It was under Ten Hag that Van de Beek played such an effective role at Ajax. Many felt that the stars had aligned for the Dutchman, but that wasn't the case.",
      "He continued to be shunned by the manager, who challenged him to force his ay into the team: \"It’s either he fights and proves himself in this environment or he goes, but for me, there is still a way for him, but it’s not going to be easy for him because the competition there is really strong.\"",
      "Van de Beek though started just twice in the first half of the season before a knee ligament injury curtailed his season. If the Dutchman thought his minutes had been at a premium then this season presented a new low as he got just two minutes in the first 20 games.",
      "That encouraged him to head out on loan once again and he now finds himself in Germany with Frankfurt. He's featured in six of the ten games since he joined the Bundesliga club, although he has been left out of their Europa League squad.",
      "Upon leaving Manchester Van de Beek did offer a subtle hint at his frustration when his temporary exit was confirmed. \"If you don't play as many games as you want, it's tough, but that's the past now. I'm here now and I'm positive,\" he said. Muller meanwhile is now 34 but has featured in 24 of Bayern's 26 Bundesliga games as he remains a stalwart.",

      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo has revealed what his nickname is back at Old Trafford ahead of his potential England debut against Brazil on Saturday night",
      "Manchester United's teenage sensation Kobbie Mainoo has revealed his nickname in the Red Devils dressing room - and it's a reference to his famous family member.",
      "The 18-year-old has been one of the shining lights for the Red Devils this term in what has been an otherwise underwhelming campaign and as a result, has earned his first senior England call-up. It was while away on international duty that Mainoo explained what some of his United colleagues call him back in Manchester.",
      "Speaking in his England's 'First Impressions' interview, Mainoo shed light on the fact that his team-mates at club level affectionately call him 'Love Island', as a nod to the fact his brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames featured on the reality show back in 2019.",
      "\"My brother was on it,\" the United midfield ace explained. \"I'm close to him. You know what, going back to another question - my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. [He's been doing so] since I was like 16.\"",
      "Keen to point out that Mainoo is not one to turn on the charm like Love Island viewers saw his brother do, the Red Devils star added: \"No, it's not even that. They're just jokers.\"",
      "Mainoo's England call-up marks the next step in what has been a meteoric rise to first-team football for both club and country. Keen to reach the next level, the 18-year-old admitted he has his sights set on being named in Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024 in the summer.",
      "\"I think that’s the end goal for the season, to get into that squad,\" Mainoo revealed, after his first training session with England at senior level. \"Obviously I’ve got to focus on club football in the meantime, and hopefully that’ll figure itself out.",
      "“It’s been a pretty mad couple of days, Sunday ­obviously was a great game and a great win. Then to get called up to the Under-21s, ­obviously I was excited to come.",
      "\"Then getting down here and realising that I was with the first team was amazing. I was shocked and happy and it’s been a whirlwind of emotions.\"",
      "England welcome Brazil to Wembley on Saturday night, before meeting Belgium on Tuesday at the same venue. Just how many minutes Mainoo will receive remains to be seen, but he is thought incredibly highly of by Three Lions boss Southgate.",

      "Jurgen Klopp was close to a Man United contract but he is never going to come close to signing a Man United contract.",
      "\"Is that for me?\" a chuckling Jurgen Klopp asked as he entered the press conference room. He was looking at an A4 sheet with the emboldened and sizeable word 'CONTRACT' above the Manchester United crest.",
      "Below the crest read, \"Congratulations on joining Manchester United. Please sign your contract below.\" Klopp must have welcomed the levity after bristling at a Scandinavian reporter in the tunnel minutes earlier. The 'contract' is a dummy used for youngsters when they receive their first professional deal.",
      "Few United fans would publicly care to admit they would have the Liverpool manager in a heartbeat. Klopp may be free in the summer but he will not be available. The nearest he might get to United is if he is summoned for some BBC punditry training across Salford Quays at Media City.",
      "Securing one of the most raucous victories against Liverpool does not make the United manager bulletproof. Last week's news vacuum was filled by the prospect of Gareth Southgate replacing Erik ten Hag. That seemed to go down about as well as that cross on the collar of the new England shirt.",
      "No right-minded United supporter leaning towards a managerial change would have Southgate over Ten Hag. United have not appointed an English manager since 1981 and this is not a golden period for Anglo coaches. Southgate and Graham Potter have done laudable work. Not laudable enough to manage the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "And so we come back to the issue raised by this correspondent weeks ago: there is not an obvious replacement for the incumbent United manager. Association with Sir Dave Brailsford is not an essential criteria. Brailsford's wheelhouse is cycling and there is still scant evidence he is a troubleshooter to get to the bottom of United's troubles.",
      "The Ineos group have opted for best-in-class appointments at chief executive and sporting director level. Southgate is not even that at international coaching level. Didier Deschamps. He would be even more ill-suited to United.",
      "Every United managerial appointment in the post-Ferguson era has generated general approval from the fanbase. A myopic many were swayed by Ferguson's endorsement of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho were proven winners, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a club legend and Ten Hag had transformed Ajax into a force again. Southgate would be the exception, however much the matchgoers would support him if he somehow strode out of the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Ten Hag was still lingering outside that tunnel gone 8pm eight days ago, posing for pictures and signing autographs. He returned to Hale for a celebratory dinner at Piccolino with his agent Kees Vos and son Nigel. They left at 11pm. A professionally early night of celebrations.",
      "While United supporters were floating out of the ground, Ten Hag's feet stayed on it. He refused to get swept up in the emotion with the dust yet to settle. \"For me, winning the trophy is more important than one of them,\" he stressed.",
      "\"One of them\" was the understatement of the season. Eight days after an uninspiring and risk-aversive win against Everton, Ten Hag looked like a United manager, in his tailored Paul Smith suit, and acted like one as he strove to salvage the season.",
      "United are operating under the working assumption Ten Hag will be in charge next season. He has been involved in planning for the pre-season tour and recruitment. If he wasn't, something would be amiss. Van Gaal told Michael Carrick he would not get a new contract in early May 2016. Thirteen days later, Van Gaal was sacked. Carrick stayed.",
      "That makeshift back four against Liverpool was practically a homage to United's midfield quartet in the FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal 13 years earlier. Dalot, Fernandes, Maguire and Antony are worthy of mention in the same breath as the Da Silvas, Gibson and O'Shea. Maguire, purportedly a defensive substitution, was one of the biggest attacking assets.",
      "Strategy underpinned United's recovery but their triumph was fuelled by emotion and desire. The 32nd-minute gap between the defence and the midfield, so distant they were almost in different timezones, and the 40-minute meandering before the unlikely twist of a right-footed Antony equaliser corroborate that.",
      "The victory did not spare Ten Hag of mention on the back pages over the coming days but United do not have decision-makers akin to the populist Ed Woodward. Woodward was mobbed by supporters, urging him to reward Solskjaer, at Charles de Gaulle Airport the morning after United beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League in March 2019.",
      "Two results ensured Solskjaer permanently relocated to Manchester: beating Tottenham, thus seeing off the threat of Mauricio Pochettino. And that night in Paris.",
      "The latter defied belief. United were 0-2 down on aggregate at kick-off and deprived of 10 senior players through injury. Progression was secured via a contentious added-time penalty that enabled United to prevail through the now-scrapped away goals rule.",
      "Gary Neville asked Solskjaer where he would like his statue to be built. Budding technical director Rio Ferdinand urged United to \"let him write whatever numbers\" on a contract. Ferguson and Eric Cantona entered United's dressing room in the Parc des Princes.",
      "The giddiness was natural. Only United did not have an objective and emotionally detached sporting director to take a step back and advise Woodward to delay any appointment until the end of the season. Solskjaer was inevitably and officially upgraded from caretaker to permanent manager less than three weeks later. United won two of their final 10 games and were dismissed 4-0 on aggregate by Barcelona in the quarter-finals.",
      "The PSG result was United's last win in a Champions League knockout tie and that was five years ago. The season ended with Klopp lifting the European Cup.",
      "That was for him.",

      "The Ineos sporting director Sir Dave Brailsford has attended the majority of United's matches since the petrochemicals group agreed to a 28% stakeholding in the club on Christmas Eve. Although Brailsford is conducting a thorough audit on United and sits on the football board, a well-placed source said he will not decide Ten Hag's position.",
      "United would prefer that a settled structure oversees any managerial change but Dan Ashworth's protracted arrival from Newcastle United is not thought to be imminent. John Murtough remains the football director but Ratcliffe glossed over his role in a round-table with journalists last month.",

      "Erik ten Hag has praised the influence of Lisandro Martinez on training sessions at Man Utd and the centre-back could be involved at Carrington this week.",
      "Erik ten Hag has tended to resort to what he knows best when conducting transfer business at Manchester United, focusing on signing players he has worked with, has been impressed by or those recommended by his agent, and it's not been a strategy without fault.",
      "It's provided as many misses as hits. Ten Hag pushed for Sofyan Amrabat this summer having worked with him at FC Utrecht but he has never looked ready for the standards of United. The Dutchman's judgement on spending big on Antony is also questionable. But the decision to sign Andre Onana is beginning to look a wise one and of all the signings made over the last two summers, Lisandro Martinez is surely the best of the lot.",
      "The Argentine has been outstanding since joining from Ajax. Ten Hag wanted the centre-back he had worked with in Amsterdam for his aggression as a defender, his quality on the ball and his leadership and personality off the field. He has delivered in every area.",
      "In a season decimated by injuries to almost every member of the squad, it is Martinez's absence that has hurt United the most. He transforms the quality of their build-up play and brings an improvement in defending, especially in one-v-one situations. The 26-year-old is a leader as well, even without the armband.",
      "He is also a valuable presence around the training ground, as Ten Hag revealed recently when discussing those players who make sure standards never drop. He name-checked four players in total but lingered on what Martinez brings to those sessions at Carrington.",
      "\"Rapha Varane, Casemiro, Bruno. Licha Martinez, when he is on the training pitch he is always front foot, always switched on and wanting to win, even in small games,\" said the United manager.",
      "Ten Hag has had to make do without that influence for most of this season, the defender having suffered a foot injury and then a knee injury that have combined to sideline him for more than 22 weeks since September. Most recently, the Argentina international went down holding his knee against West Ham at the start of February, with scans revealing he had suffered damage to the medial collateral ligament.",
      "That was a better prognosis than initially feared and a recovery time of eight weeks suggests a return is close. He travelled to the United States with his Argentina teammates during the international break and was pictured on the training ground. He is likely to return to training at Carrington this week and will aim to return to the side either at Brentford or in games against Chelsea and Liverpool later in the week.",
      "Martinez's return to action will be vital, with Ten Hag always talking about the importance of having a left-footed central defender in the side. United have missed that balance this season. His return to action at Carrington will also be just as valuable, helping to raise standards in sessions as Ten Hag tries to plot a successful end to the season via Champions League qualification and an FA Cup triumph.",
      "Last year Ten Hag talked about needing the \"personality and character\" that Martinez brings to a squad. With so much on the line between now and the end of May, he needs those traits more than ever.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe believes Manchester United have the 'opportunity' to build a 'state of the art' stadium that could house up to 100,000 supporters",
      "The designers responsible for Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium have reportedly drawn up plans for Manchester United as new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe considers the future of Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe wants to revamp United's stadium, and designers have reportedly drawn up plans already, which are now being examined. Speaking on the Geraint Thomas Cycling Club podcast earlier this month, the Ineos chief hinted at plans to increase capacity to 100,000.",
      "He said: \"You have got this opportunity if you choose to, to build a completely new ground, because we have got enough space. If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state-of-the-art, world class, 90,000 or maybe even 100,000 that then provides a platform for some of the big competitions in the north of England.",
      "\"Why do England always play in the South? Why is the FA Cup final always in the South? Why can't the Champions League final be in the North occasionally?",
      "\"Football in the North is just as important as it is in the south, arguably more so, and the people in the north pay their taxes, so why do we have Wembley, Twickenham, Wimbledon etc in the south. What have we got in the North? There's a strong argument to build a 'Wembley of the North'.\"",
      "And now, according to a report from the Daily Mail, stadium designers Populous have already come up with proposals to renovate or rebuild Old Trafford. The company, according to the report, have been brought in by the Glazers and the plans they came up with are now being 'scrutinised by Ratcliffe's INEOS people'.",
      "A task force was set up earlier this month to explore the club's options, with former United captain Gary Neville, Lord Sebastian Coe and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, all involved. And Neville has admitted the 'commercial aspect' will ultimately be the deciding factor for Ratcliffe.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, the former England international said: \"I think everyone knows that it's one of two options; either renovate and refurbish the existing Old Trafford or develop a brand new stadium next to Old Trafford.",
      "\"Every structural solution is different. Until you get into the meat of the work and see what is really brought forward, then I don't think anyone has the answer. That's the reason that the group has been set up, to help answer some of those questions.",
      "\"The work that goes on and the findings of the work that goes down [will help form a decision], but it will also come down to the commercial aspect of what will be afforded. We know that a new stadium – well, a refurbishment costs a lot of money – but a brand new stadium costs more.\""

      "Erik ten Hag is still under pressure at Man Utd as he fights for his future at Old Trafford following a disappointing season and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment.",
      "There are, Erik ten Hag will hope, exactly two months of the English season to go. The FA Cup final will bring the curtain down on the domestic action on May 25 and for the second successive season, Manchester United will hope to be there.",
      "It could yet be another Manchester derby final at Wembley and by then we might also have a clearer indication of whether Ten Hag will remain in charge at Old Trafford into next season. At the moment, his future is perhaps the biggest unknown at the club.",
      "A thrilling FA Cup quarter-final win against Liverpool last weekend has given the season an injection of optimism and United could yet qualify for the Champions League and win a trophy, but it does feel like Ten Hag is on trial for the next couple of months.",
      "Ineos are overhauling the football structure at United since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment into the club was confirmed and that includes a focus on the manager's position. So with the clock ticking on this season, what do we know about Ten Hag's future? Here is the latest.",
      "No. Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn't come out and publicly backed Ten Hag in his media comments so far, but there is no sense a decision has been made. Ten Hag still has time to prove himself.",
      "The season could yet be a success if he salvages Champions League football and wins the FA Cup and it remains too early to judge the Dutchman, who has mitigating factors this season when you consider United's injury record.",
      "But there are concerns around the tactics this season and Ten Hag's transfer record. He needs a strong finish to the campaign to be absolutely certain of getting Ineos' backing.",
      "As the MEN reported on Monday, it is incoming chief executive Omar Berrada who is set to be at the centre of any potential change in the dugout this summer.",
      "Berrada is due to take over officially in the summer and currently remains on gardening leave having left a role at Manchester City, but it is understood he will have a major say both on Ten Hag's future and any potential replacement.",
      "While Ratcliffe is likely to offer his thoughts on the matter, he is keen to delegate to those with football expertise and Berrada is at the top of the organisational structure, with new sporting director Dan Ashworth reporting into him.",
      "There is no criteria that has been laid out to save Ten Hag but there hasn't been any dissent from the stands and he was cheered after masterminding the FA Cup win against Liverpool.",
      "With a lack of obvious candidates to replace him, the 53-year-old will certainly feel he has done enough to stay on as manager if he can get United back into the Champions League and win the FA Cup.",
      "The former looks achievable after Aston Villa and Tottenham dropped points last weekend and it looks increasingly likely fifth place will be enough to qualify for the Champions League. In the FA Cup, if United end up facing Manchester City once again in the final then there will be pressure on to finally stop Pep Guardiola's trophy machine.",
      "Unlikely, but not impossible. Ten Hag has been insistent this year that he must have \"control\" over transfers and he has had plenty of power since taking over at United in the summer of 2022.",
      "The transfer strategy over the three windows he has been in charge for has his fingerprints all over, for better or worse. For every success of Lisandro Martinez or Andre Onana, there are question marks around players such as Sofyan Amrabat and Antony.",
      "Ineos are bringing in a new football structure and that is likely to see Ten Hag's power diluted at least a little. Those close to him in Holland insist it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that he decides he can't work in that kind of structure and walks away.",
      "There is no stand-out candidate and that is a major bonus for Ten Hag. When he got the job almost two years ago it felt like a simple decision between Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino, with both having reasonable claims for the job. Now, there is no leading candidate.",
      "Gareth Southgate is liked by Ineos, but the current England manager is focused on Euro 2024 and unlikely to even consider an approach until the tournament is over, while the negative reaction from supporters to his name being in the frame could be telling.",
      "Graham Potter is a coach who is available and has links with Ashworth, while his spell at Chelsea looks better in hindsight. Roberto De Zerbi will also be considered having signalled his unhappiness at Brighton recently.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is the most high-profile coach available, but his record of falling out with his bosses is unlikely to appeal to Ineos. Ruben Amorim is highly rated for his work at Sporting and could be in the frame.",

      "Shearer echoed Richards' comments about Mainoo, and was impressed by one area of the United midfielder's performance for England against Brazil.",

      "Man United defender Luke Shaw has so far missed 14 games through injury this season and is racing against time to return to action ahead of this summer's Euro 2024",
      "England manager Gareth Southgate has revealed that Luke Shaw is unlikely to be available for the entirety of this summer's Euros after enduring an injury-plagued campaign.",
      "The Manchester United left-back has had a number of muscle injuries, including a serious hamstring issue and has been limited to just 12 Premier League games this season. As a result, he has also missed the latest international break.",
      "Shaw is facing a race against time to return to action for United ahead of a crucial run-in. Even if he does return in time, Southgate believes his involvement with the England squad will be limited.",
      "\"He’s going to be right on the edge of the season,\" the Three Lions boss said after the 1-0 defeat to Brazil on Saturday. \"We know now to play seven matches in a Euros is highly unlikely.\"",
      "Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell replaced Shaw but came in for criticism for his display against Brazil. \"I thought Ben defended really well and it was an important game for him,\" Southgate added. \"I don’t want to kill Ben. But Luke’s one of the best left-backs in world football, frankly.\"",
      "Another issue for Southgate is the midfield. He has been keen to use Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold alongside Declan Rice. However, Alexander-Arnold was unavailable for the latest round of friendlies through injury, while regulars Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips also drifted out of contention, with United youngster Kobbie Mainoo making his senior international debut.",
      "\"The midfield thing we’ve seen, but we’ve missed two opportunities with September and now this one that is really frustrating because there’s so much that’s unknown about it at the minute,\" Southgate continued. \"As you know, I’ve liked the idea for a long time but we’re going to be trialling it when we haven’t seen it in a really high level game.",
      "\"So we’ll just have to see where we can go with it. It’s such a specialist position. There’s a huge difference between playing at full-back and popping into midfield and playing in there, starting in there, in and out of position in the game. Receiving with your back to goal, so there’s a lot to that. We’re just going to have to see.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag wants to retain the power he has had so far at Man Utd but Sir Jim Ratcliffe is planning on making key changes to football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "An Old Trafford afternoon for the ages hasn't done an awful lot to quieten the noise around Erik ten Hag's future over the past week or so. That unforgettable success against Liverpool is already fading into the distance, even if the memories will last a lifetime.",
      "Achieve that and it might be enough to secure Ten Hag's future, but there are no guarantees at the moment and plenty of issues to consider, for the new football structure at Old Trafford and for Ten Hag himself.",
      "With no public display of commitment to the manager, Ineos have left a void around Ten Hag into which speculation will fall. He is fighting for his future after a disappointing season, although it is a campaign that is still salvageable in late March. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford are digging deep into every facet of the club and it's no surprise the manager's position is under review.",
      "At the moment the discussion around Ten Hag's future has focused on whether he is the right man for the job and who the alternatives could be. It has been painted as a decision for Ineos to make and that is broadly correct. If the season spirals out of control once more then they will surely act.",
      "But there could yet be another issue in play at Old Trafford as Ratcliffe rips up the football department to insert a best-in-class structure, namely whether Ten Hag is comfortable changing the way he has worked in his first two seasons at the club.",
      "The Dutchman had a strong working relationship with Ajax sporting director Marc Overmars, but in Amsterdam and Manchester, he has had the final say on transfers. He has been the most powerful person at both of those clubs.",
      "That is something that Ineos might be looking to change. They already have a new chief executive with a greater focus on football in Omar Berrada, while Dan Ashworth will run the operation as sporting director. Further hires around recruitment are expected before the summer.",
      "It is going to lead to significant changes in the structure of the organisation and the roles of staff already there. Ten Hag could become a head coach rather than a manager, with his focus on coaching and improving the players he is given. He would maintain a say in recruitment, but it might not be quite as powerful as it has been over the last couple of years.",
      "Will that satisfy Ten Hag? Time will tell, but his public comments on the issue haven't left any wriggle room. Even before starting work at United, back in April 2022 when he had been confirmed as the club's new manager but remained in charge at Ajax, he was talking about power.",
      "He said at that point that \"control in transfers is a condition for me\". Asked recently if that remained his stance, he said: \"Yes, I am sure. It’s control. And I have had the talks with them about it.",
      "\"They will not bring in players who the manager doesn’t want, because that will not work. We will work there together, with suggestions, bringing players in and discussing.",
      "\"Then it is about picking the right players, it is about cooperation and togetherness. That is the way they want to work.\"",
      "Ten Hag sounded confident that he had the answers he wanted from Ineos, but it's hard to imagine a scenario where he continues to get a veto over transfers. For every Lisandro Martinez, there is a Sofyan Amrabat. He has relied on players he knows so far and the record is mixed.",
      "He might point to the fact that United have been overhauling their own scouting processes recently, which has forced him to rely on what he knows, and maybe Ten Hag will want to work within a more defined football structure, but it's unlikely Ratcliffe will be bringing in executives of the calibre of Berrada and Ashworth simply to carry out the manager's orders.",
      "As the season ticks down there will be meat on the bones as to how the structure will work. Ten Hag might then get the answers he wants over what exactly his role will be and whether there will be changes.",
      "Firstly, he needs results and a strong finish to the season to secure his own position, but the possibility remains that Ten Hag might decide he can't work within the new structure. It's unlikely at the moment, but sources in the Netherlands have raised the prospect of the 53-year-old walking away if he doesn't get the assurances he wants.",
      "That might sound unlikely, but in almost two years at United it's become clear Ten Hag is a strong-willed character. He knows what he needs to operate and he will expect to retain the power he has now at Old Trafford. That could yet be a source of friction in the months ahead.",

Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",
      "They are six points adrift of Europe, with that gap likely to widen when third-place Arsenal face off with Aston Villa tomorrow. In fact, should Liverpool avoid defeat in the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon, United will end the weekend in fifth place.",
      "It is quite the fall from grace for a side who missed out on the title by just two points last term and were only narrowly beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup final. It is fair to say that if the Reds came into this season riding the crest of a wave sparked by their previous successes, then their tumultuous recent form means the club is now well and truly on the rocks.",
      "And perhaps the most frustrating thing about this weekend's defeat is that it was so predictable. Three times since the turn of the year, United have gone into a season-defining game needing to deliver. Three times they have failed to do so.",
      "Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Skinner's side found themselves two goals down inside 23 minutes. Hayley Ladd clawed one back on the stroke of half-time before Lauren James' third of the day made sure of the victory for the hosts.",
      "Against Arsenal at the Emirates, United went into the break 3-0 down, with Lucia Garcia's stoppage-time goal proving to be little more than a consolation. That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "The latest transfer news as Barcelona president Joan Laporta reveals his stance over a summer move for Manchester United-linked Frenkie de Jong",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta is confident that Frenkie de Jong is 'delighted' at the club and does not want to leave despite past links with a move to Manchester United.",
      "The Spanish club have been stuck in a financial rut, needing to cut their wage bill in order to meet the £174.8m salary cap placed on them by La Liga. This will likely require the sale of playing staff in the summer, as their actual wage bill has been budgeted at well over double that amount.",
      "One of those linked with an exit to ease the problem has been De Jong. It was suggested he would be a top target for Erik ten Hag when the coach arrived at Old Trafford in 2022, and circumstance means that two years later a reunion for the former Ajax duo is once again speculated upon.",
      "However in what is a major blow to that train of thought, Laporta is adamant that his midfielder is settled in Catalonia, and therefore a move to Manchester United would be out of the equation.",
      "\"The last thing he would want would be to leave Barcelona. He has told me more than once, that he is delighted here,\" the 61-year-old confirmed to Mundo Deportivo. \"We have margin. We are delighted with him. I'm not worried about anyone and if someone wants to leave, we can't go against a player's will.",
      "\"But I think everyone wants to stay and we want everyone we have to stay. We don't want any of them to leave, because no team in history has been a flash in the pan.",
      "\"The teams that have won have had a period of consolidation and maturation. This team is having it with very young people and will pass us by with the previous stage. We have players who will last many years, all of these we are talking about. We have to prioritise making the entire team powerful.\"",
      "This message falls in line with his colleague, Barca's sporting director Deco, who in February said the Dutchman would be staying put. \"Nothing will happen to them,\" he said about De Jong and team-mate Ronald Araujo. \"They are important players for now and for the future. They have earned the right to be here and the respect of the fans and everyone. We know where we want to go and we are counting on them.\"",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag has successfully managed to get a consistent tune out of Diogo Dalot.",
      "Having set themselves the objective of signing a new right-back this forthcoming summer, Manchester United need to reconsider.",
      "Not for the first time in recent weeks, Diogo Dalot's performance in last weekend's FA Cup quarter-final epic against Liverpool at Old Trafford earned widespread praise and admiration. He has firmly established himself as one of the most consistent and important players in the squad.",
      "Regularly producing performances that are worthy of a solid seven or eight out of 10, the Portuguese international has established himself as United's head right-back again following a ding-dong battle with Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the second half of last season.",
      "His performances in recent weeks have been reminiscent of those he produced prior to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where he cemented himself as one of the first names on the teamsheet. He now finds himself in that same position once again, despite the recent return of Wan-Bissaka from injury.",
      "The former AC Milan loanee has developed considerably this season, adjusting and developing his style of play to ensure he remains aligned with the latest trend of a modern-day full-back. He has regularly tucked into midfield to offer support in the centre, resulting in United having an extra body in the engine room.",
      "He has also improved defensively, quashing suggestions that he was only of use to United in attacking scenarios. He has averaged 2.2 tackles, 2.9 clearances, 5.7 ball recoveries and been dribbled past just 0.5 times per 90 in the Premier League this season.",
      "Moreover, he has consistently been available for Erik ten Hag, not missing a single match in any competition this season through injury. He has only been left out of one matchday squad and that was against West Ham United at the London Stadium on December 23 due to suspension, following the red card he had earned against Liverpool just under a week earlier.",
      "In total, he has featured in 38 of United's 40 matches this season, failing to make it off the bench against Wolves on the opening weekend of the season, in addition to the suspension he served against the Hammers. In a season that has seen United hampered by injury issues, particularly in defence, he has been a constant presence.",
      "Admitting recently that he is currently enjoying the best form of his career, it is hard to disagree with the 25-year-old, who has done more than enough to stake a claim to cement himself in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's long-term plans for the club. His form over the course of the season has been so good that the addition of a new right-back may no longer be a necessity for United ahead of next term.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, Bayer Leverkusen ace Jeremie Frimpong is a player United are keeping a close eye on ahead of the summer. He has excelled for the Bundesliga title hopefuls this term, deservedly earning interest from a crop of big-name clubs.",
      "However, there are positions within United's ranks, such as central midfield and centre-back, that are in greater need of fresh blood. Plus, Frimpong, formerly of Manchester City, is more accustomed to a wing-back role, whereas Dalot is tailor-made for the full-back role at Old Trafford.",
      "United, as revealed last September, have plans to sign a new full-back this summer, but their need for a right-back is no longer as great as possibly first thought. It is possible Wan-Bissaka may be sold, opening up a window of opportunity to sign a replacement to act as Dalot's understudy, but the money could be better spent on recruiting a left-back instead, such has been the volume of injury-related issues United have encountered on that side of the back four this term.",
      "Tyrell Malacia has not kicked a ball all season and Luke Shaw has been limited to just 15 appearances in all competitions. As good as the latter is when he is fully fit and firing on all cylinders, his injury record is becoming hard to defend.",
      "Therefore, signing a first-choice left-back could become a bigger priority than signing a starting right-back. Dalot, on current form, does not deserve to be dislodged from Ten Hag's strongest starting XI.",

      "Manchester United and Newcastle have a strange rivalry centred around the biggest transfer snub of the formative Premier League years.",
      "For a Manchester United fan, the response to Alan Shearer's tweet was absolutely delicious. A quote from famous TV gameshow Bullseye saying, \"Look at what you would have won,\" next to an image of Sir Alex Ferguson proudly parading the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies.",
      "There's little wonder it's still a raw subject for Shearer, who still gets asked about it to this day.",
      "“NEVER! I couldn’t stand them then and I can’t stand them now!!!” That was his tweet on the subject of regrets in his career, and whether snubbing United (twice) still rankled.",
      "His first opportunity to make the Old Trafford move came in 1992, with Shearer choosing Blackburn and United choosing Eric Cantona. The latter would swiftly help United win successive league titles and the FA Cup.",
      "But it was in 1996, when football (nearly) came home, that Ferguson would make his biggest play for the striker everybody wanted. Think Harry Kane or Erling Haaland now, Shearer was of that ilk. He would have taken Fergie's United to the next level.",
      "\"I'd actually done a deal as far as Alan Shearer's contract was concerned, we'd come to a settlement,\" said former United chairman Martin Edwards. \"Shearer had been to Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come. The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United, local rivals, both Lancashire clubs.",
      "\"He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him.\"",
      "Everyone knows the next bit. And the public perception wasn't that Blackburn had snatched Shearer from under the nose of United, it was viewed as a snub from Shearer. In reality, it was both.",
      "The fact he chose Newcastle, with whom he would become a club legend but win nothing, was the part that made United fans laugh. And, so the song goes, they signed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer instead.",
      "In more than a decade at the club after joining in the summer of 1996, Solskjaer won six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League in 1999, when his famous toe-poke secured the treble in dramatic style. That year, Newcastle finished 13th in the Premier League and United comfortably saw them off in the FA Cup final, 2-0 victors.",
      "\"Of course, I was tempted to join Manchester United, but I do not regret either decision,\" Shearer insisted recently. \"I had a magical time at Blackburn, winning the league. And I completed my own dream of playing for my home town club of Newcastle. I have memories I will hold forever and a goalscoring record that makes me extremely proud.\"",
      "Ferguson, who was initially incensed that Shearer wasn't convinced to come to Old Trafford — despite giving him assurances that he could have the No.9 shirt (but that he wouldn't be taking penalties, given Cantona's 100 per cent record from the spot) — didn't lose much sleep over it, in the end.",
      "“I thought that if they were the only things worrying him, we would get our man,\" he said. “History will prove whether he was right to pick Newcastle ahead of us.\"",
      "Only Shearer knows, deep down, whether he is truly at peace with his decision. United certainly didn't have many regrets in that period of history, but they weren't used to being snubbed.",
      "So when you hear 'Cheer up Alan Shearer', to the tune of 'Daydream Believer' by the Monkees, or the famous Solskjaer song ring around Old Trafford, just remember this saga and that Ferguson quote in particular. United fans have enjoyed goading Shearer for the best part of two decades. That isn't going to change soon.",

Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present.

      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Man Utd showed character to hold on and get a good point away at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Harry Maguire has joined the growing list of Manchester United injuries after returning from England duty following scans",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has suffered an injury following England's 1-0 defeat to Brazil and has been released from the Three Lions camp.",
      "England suffered their first defeat in 21 matches on Sunday after 17-year-old prodigy Endrick scored the all-important goal for Brazil during their international friendly at Wembley Stadium. United centre-back Maguire has now left the camp with Gareth Southgate's side after undergoing scans on an injury.",
      "Maguire was replaced after 67 minutes by Lewis Dunk and it has been claimed that the 31-year-old has now been ruled out of their friendly against Belgium on Tuesday. In a report from the Mail, it is said that Maguire underwent scans after limping off against Brazil.",
      "It is not yet clear whether Maguire will be involved in United's upcoming Premier League match against Brentford, next Saturday. A severe injury to the defender would see Maguire join the growing list of defensive problems for Erik ten Hag.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is currently sidelined with a knee injury, while Jonny Evans has faced fitness concerns in recent weeks. Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia are also out with the backline severely depleted - which has forced Victor Lindelof to deputise at full-back, as well as Aaron Wan-Bissaka who recently overcame a knock.",
      "On Sunday, England confirmed that Maguire was one of three players to end their spell with the national team through injury with Kyle Walker and Sam Johnstone both returning to their respective clubs. They wrote: \"Maguire, Walker and Johnstone have returned to their respective clubs for assessment having sustained injuries in recent days.\"",
      "As a result, James Trafford and Rico Lewis have been promoted from Lee Carsley's under-21s to Southgate's senior squad.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo made his England debut against Brazil and the Man Utd teenager gave another glimpse of his remarkable potential at Wembley.",
      "Just over a year ago Kobbie Mainoo stood on the Wembley pitch in his Manchester United suit trying to take it all in. He had made just three first-team appearances at this point and hadn't made the squad for the Carabao Cup final triumph against Newcastle, but in amongst the celebrations after the game Erik ten Hag sought him out for a chat.",
      "It was a telling moment. This was a then 17-year-old midfielder only on the very fringes of the senior squad, but as Ten Hag revelled in winning a first trophy as United manager, he went over to the Stockport-born academy graduate and shared a few words. The Dutchman has been taken with Mainoo's quality since the first time he saw him and maybe in that snatched conversation he was telling him there would be more days like this to come.",
      "Neither would have expected it to come this quickly. Mainoo's 24th senior appearance was for England against Brazil and it was the first time he had played at Wembley. It has been a meteoric rise this season.",
      "Gareth Southgate described Mainoo's 15-minute cameo against Brazil as a \"chance to dip his toes\", having been called into the squad earlier in the week with Jordan Henderson struggling with an injury picked up while playing for Ajax. But as we've come to expect with Mainoo, he dived in head first rather than dip his toe in.",
      "His first major contribution came just four minutes after he had come on. He was being pushed back towards his own goal, carrying the ball back into his own half under pressure from Wolves midfielder and reported United summer transfer target, Joao Gomes. What happened next showed everyone inside Wembley and those watching at home that this was a teenager who was the real deal.",
      "Mainoo had received a short pass from Declan Rice but took a series of quick touches with his right foot to position his body to turn away from Gomes, using both feet to nudge the ball forward and away from the Brazil midfielder. Mainoo now had space to drive into, facing the opposition goal.",
      "It was a moment of class under pressure that regular watchers of United have become accustomed to. On several occasions at Old Trafford a week ago Mainoo caressed the ball away from Liverpool players. His quick feet in crowded spaces were particularly noticeable at Luton last month when he was the best United player when it came to keeping the ball and finding ways to dribble out of a tight situation or two. The moment at Wembley made an impression on Southgate, who referenced Mainoo's ability to spin his way out of tight situations after the game.",
      "\"To get Kobbie on the pitch was a brilliant moment for him and his family. You saw a couple of turns and a couple of really composed moments that is a bit of an indication of what he might become,\" he said.",
      "If that was the highlight, then other moments showed the teenager's quality. He exchanged sharp passes with Rice on a few occasions, dropped deep to help his side out of a press and created an angle to drill a forward pass to Jarrod Bowen when in the centre of the pitch. It was the kind of debut that suggested there was more to come, just as Ten Hag sensed 13 months ago after the Carabao Cup final.",

      "Exclusive: Man Utd youngster Will Fish is nearing the end of his second loan with Hibs and he spoke to the MEN to reflect on his time in Scotland, how he's developed as a player and his hopes for the future.",
      "Edinburgh is Scotland's most picturesque city and somewhere on a winding cobblestone lane, you might find Manchester United youngster Will Fish drinking a coffee.",
      "Fish is thoroughly enjoying his loan with Hibernian and he unwinds from football by exploring Scotland's capital, and spending time with his teammates on the golf course.",
      "\"You're spoilt for choice with golf up there, so I've taken advantage of it really,\" Fish told the Manchester Evening News on a day off during the international break.",
      "\"We've got a good little golf squad in the team, so it's good to play when we can. I also live by the beach and I'm down there quite often.\" Fish was quizzed on his golfing ability and he insisted: \"I'm actually all right! I'm into single figures with my handicap now.\"",
      "The MEN contacted Fish to speak about his loan with Hibernian, his development and what might come next for him. He's a local Manchester lad, born in Denton, and he's been on United's books since he joined the academy when he was just seven.",
      "Fish is coming to the end of his second loan with Hibernian and matured during his time in Scotland, learning his trade and playing competitive fixtures each week.",
      "\"I had a few other options but, to be honest, as soon as I heard Hibs were in for me, I jumped straight on the train,\" he said about first joining Hibs in September 2022.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I could have made. I didn’t really know how big the club was before I went but I soon realised. I didn’t play properly until after Christmas, but even when I wasn’t playing, I was enjoying it, just being around the squad environment and whatnot.",
      "\"You get quite a lot of exposure in Scotland, you’re playing the Old Firm three or four times a season and the big Edinburgh derbies are brilliant, so there’s a lot of games on Sky.\"",
      "The atmospheric Easter Road Stadium on Edinburgh derby day is a far cry from Leigh Sports Village where United's Under-21s play. Having made plenty of appearances at Leigh, Fish laughed at the comparison and said: \"It’s definitely a few steps ahead of reserve football.\"",
      "United sources have described Fish as 'very calm and really mature for his age' and the defender admitted that he didn't find it difficult to settle into life in Scotland.",
      "\"The changing room is really good,\" Fish said. \"I’ve made a few good mates that will probably be my friends for life now. Everyone helped me settle in and I’ve got some friends outside of football as well from Edinburgh, so it’s been pretty easy to move north of the border.\"",
      "Fish was forced to wait three months for his first Hibs start, but he grabbed his opportunity with both hands when it arrived and became a mainstay for the rest of the season.",
      "By the end of 2022/23, Fish made 21 appearances in all competitions, he'd scored three goals and helped Hibs to qualify for the UEFA Conference League with a fifth-placed league finish.",
      "Lee Johnson was the manager responsible for signing Fish and, near the end of the campaign, he said: \"Will has been fantastic. I've said before if you could build a centre-half, you'd build Will Fish. He's a great student and a great lad. It's been a big step for him and he's really taken to it.\"",
      "Fish reflected: \"I just needed to stick in at the start when I wasn’t playing because I knew I'd eventually get my chance, and obviously you just have to take it when it comes.",
      "\"Luckily, I’ve played pretty much every game since my first start, so it’s been excellent and you’re going to have ups and downs in football, so it’s just about managing that.",
      "\"As I said before, the experience I’ve gained with Hibs has made it the best decision I could have made, and that's part of the reason why I went back and played again this season.",
      "\"Because I only played half the season in my first loan, I wanted to play for them again. Obviously, there was the European factor as well and I wanted to be on that journey.\"",
      "Fish returned to United last summer after his initial loan and he played in pre-season games against Leeds, Lyon and Wrexham, but another loan was agreed, just as he wanted.",
      "The centre-back had attracted interest from clubs in the Championship and League One, as well as rival clubs in Scotland, including Aberdeen, but he chose to return to Hibs.",
      "That has proved to be a great decision. Not only has Fish gained experience playing against the likes of Inter Escaldes, FC Luzern and Aston Villa in European competition, but he's continued to start every game, he's learned again and become a better player overall.",
      "Staff at United consider his loan to have been 'very successful due to the volume of games played and against decent level of opposition' and Fish is loving his football.",
      "He has thrived under the expectations that playing for Hibs brings. \"The Edinburgh derbies have been amazing games, I couldn’t tell you exactly how many I’ve played in, but it’s been quite a few and they’re the games you look forward to when the fixtures come out,\" he said.",
      "\"They’re high-pressure, but those are the games you want to be involved in as a footballer. Fair play to both sets of fans because they create a great atmosphere and make it a special day.",
      "\"In terms of what I've learned, I think for me, especially with the position I play, it was more trying to get the experience of playing against different strikers and when you are under the cosh and have to see out three points, just that little bit of know-how and experience that I needed to add.",
      "\"That comes with age, but it’s something I’m picking up on each week and trying to do better physically. You play against a lot of big strikers in Scotland, so managing that and I feel like it’s going well.\"",
      "Johnson, who signed Fish twice, was sacked shortly after he arrived for his second loan and Hibs appointed Nick Montgomery, who has also been a big supporter of him.",
      "\"I can’t see anything bad about Lee Johnson,\" Fish said. \"He gave me my debut and the opportunity to make my way in professional football, so I’ll always be grateful for that.",
      "\"Nick has come in and his style of play, from the first day, was 4-4-2. He’s got his assistant with him who is very tactical and loves that side of the game, and I’ve really enjoyed it.",
      "\"We’ve changed formation now, but I think they’re two very good coaches. It's been really good and we go into games knowing what we’re going to do with a plan, so that’s all you can ask for.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes' remarkable record of avoiding injury has been highlighted in Manchester, and Fish has similarly always been available for selection in Edinburgh.",
      "Although Fish only celebrated his 21st birthday last month, he's started 39 of a possible 41 games in all competitions and, admirably, he's delivered week in, week out.",
      "\"I think that’s something that goes a bit under the radar, to go that many matches, it’s physically and mentally tough,\" he said about his durability this season.",
      "\"Especially in what you could call my first proper season of professional football. Being available for every game is a massive trait and I think it can take you a long way in your career. It’s just living right and I just enjoy playing for Hibs, so I'll take any chance I can to do that.",
      "\"I don’t know the maths exactly, but hopefully if I start every game for the rest of the season I can reach 50 starts. If I can get to that, it will be incredible and I can look back with pride.\"",
      "United technical director Darren Fletcher has been described as a big part of Fish's loans due to his Scottish connections, while it's understood Les Parry and Danny Keough have managed the day-to-day relationship between both clubs, along with going up to Scotland to watch games.",
      "\"Les has come up a few times and he meets me for a coffee and what have you,\" Fish said. \"He’ll call me every now and then and I keep in touch with Fletch on WhatsApp.",
      "\"They obviously watch the clips from the games and stuff. To be honest with you, I don’t need much, I can sort of be on my own, but it's really good and I appreciate what they do.",
      "\"Les will come into the club, speak with the manager and staff, and I’ll go for a coffee with him after training and just talk about life and make sure everything is ok.\"",
      "When asked if he'd spoken to Erik ten Hag last summer before re-signing for Hibs on loan, he said: \"Little bits here and there, he’s sort of quite reserved in what he does. I don’t really know what he thinks. I'm just taking it step by step and if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be.\"",
      "Almost two years ago, United travelled to Thailand and Australia for pre-season in Ten Hag's first summer in charge and Fish was drafted in after a withdrawal from Axel Tuanzebe.",
      "\"I must have got a call at 7.30pm and the next morning I was on a flight to Australia,\" he said. \"They say in football you always have to be ready and I was dropped at the airport at 5am.",
      "\"I don’t think many 19-year-olds travel to Australia on their own. But I was in first class, so it was ok!\"",
      "Fish was given a new United contract, which expires in 2025 with the option of another year, before receiving the call-up and he was excited to meet up with the squad.",
      "It was the kind of opportunity he'd dreamt of and with United leading 3-0 against Crystal Palace in Melbourne, he was substituted on for the final 25 minutes of the game.",
      "Unfortunately, Palace played a ball through with just minutes remaining and Fish, who was the last man, denied a goalscoring opportunity by committing a clumsy challenge.",
      "He was shown a straight red card and looked devastated as he trudged off the pitch. \"At the time, I felt like the whole world was crashing down on me,\" Fish said.",
      "\"That’s where I think I’ve learned and grown up because I look back and it doesn’t really matter, do you know what I mean? If that happened now, I’d know how to deal with it differently.",
      "\"They [the staff and players] knew it didn’t matter but it’s hard to take that on board in the heated moment. But everything happens for a reason, doesn't it? It doesn't bother me now.\"",
      "Fish was asked which senior players had given him pointers and he said: \"The last summer gone, Scott [McTominay], Tom [Heaton] and Harry Maguire were really helpful. They’re really good lads, they seemed to help the young lads on a daily basis and I really appreciated that.\"",
      "Fish was the 240th player to come through United's academy to make his first-team debut. When he was just 17, he was given a cameo by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer against Wolves on the final day of the 2020/21 Premier League season, something which he's still immensely proud of.",
      "\"It's a dream come true, to be honest,\" he told MUTV after the match with a huge smile on his face, and that grin returned when he was asked about his senior bow.",
      "\"Even though it was just for a few minutes, it’s something that can never be taken away from me. I’ve got the shirt from that day framed in my mum’s house,\" Fish said.",
      "\"It’s a special moment and hopefully I can play in the Premier League again one day. If I remember correctly, I think I went straight to St. George’s Park with England after that game, so it was FaceTime with my family and they were obviously very proud, so it was a great moment.\"",
      "Fish's performances for Hibs haven't gone unnoticed and he generated interest in the January transfer window, with Cardiff considering a permanent bid for his signature.",
      "\"I think it was the right thing to stay in January purely because I felt like Hibs was a place I could kick on with my learning again. Touch wood, so far it’s worked out,\" he said.",
      "\"I’ve played every game since and there’s no guarantees in football, but especially if you go to a new club in January, you never know where you are in that pecking order. So I'm really glad I stayed, hopefully it works out and we can qualify for European football again.\"",
      "Sources have indicated there's been plenty of interest in taking Fish on loan next season, although it's understood a decision has yet to be made on whether he stays at United.",
      "It's obvious when talking to Fish that he doesn't want to play a backup role. He's had a taste of regular senior football with Hibs and his career has blossomed as a result.",
      "Fish was asked where he sees himself in 10 years, briefly paused and said: \"I’d liked to have racked up a lot of games, whether that be Championship, higher or lower, and then trophies.",
      "\"Trophies are a big thing and I’d love to win one, or get promoted with a team and just enjoy it, to be honest. It’s not a long career, so I think if you enjoy it as much as you can, you’ll look back once you’ve finished and you’ve got no regrets, then that’s all you can ask for.\"",
      "Fish is hungry to play football. There will be more time to play golf when he retires.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is training with England during the international break and his rise at Man United has been a joy to follow.",
      "When Manchester United and Real Madrid played each other in pre-season last summer, a fan posted photos of Jude Bellingham and Kobbie Mainoo on social media.",
      "The caption read: \"Bellingham and England's best midfielder.\"",
      "The post was intended as a joke, but there's an outside chance that Mainoo could start alongside the Real Madrid star at this summer's European Championship in Germany.",
      "Bellingham and Declan Rice are guaranteed to start and Mainoo would perfectly complement that pair as the No.8, but it would be a remarkable achievement for him to be included in the England squad, never mind to be given a prominent role in the team by Gareth Southgate.",
      "Mainoo has been exceptional for United this season and his performances haven't come as a surprise to those who know him best - they were confident he would succeed.",
      "The MEN exclusively revealed in July that Mainoo was set to be kept around the first team and that preceded him becoming the breakout star of the pre-season tour.",
      "Mainoo was brilliant in friendlies against Lyon, Leeds and Arsenal, and his breakthrough into the team was only delayed by the ankle injury he sustained against Real Madrid.",
      "The club carefully handled his return in October and he made a handful of appearances for the Under-21s to get back up to speed, with the words 'eased back into action' used.",
      "Mainoo's performance against Salford was impressive and the MEN's match report read: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first team.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag played Mainoo in successive away games against Everton, Newcastle and Galatasaray and he performed like someone with over 300 senior appearances.",
      "Mainoo's composure is remarkable and if he was any more laidback, he'd probably be horizontal. That trait struck coaches from an early age and the anecdote from when Mainoo trained with the first team for the first time at Carrington encapsulates his personality.",
      "That's because when Mainoo took part in his first training session with the first team, he nonchalantly told a coach 'it was alright' and that he 'did OK'. It's understood two senior players subsequently told that coach he'd actually made a strong impression and held his own.",
      "That is typical of his character and his family, who have a Ghanaian background, help to keep him grounded. Mainoo has the right people around him and still lives with his mother.",
      "United sources have said they would be surprised if Mainoo ever got ahead of himself and he's been described as a very calm character who takes everything in his stride.",
      "A source also described him as 'a real natural talent with high technical ability' and everyone who knows the player paints a picture of a grounded, likeable young man.",
      "There have been dozens of players to come through United's academy who have gone by the wayside due to mentality concerns, but such doubts have never existed with Mainoo.",
      "He has the required temperament to enjoy a brilliant career, and his ability was identifiable when he was just five years old, as his former coach explained in January 2023.",
      "\"In terms of my time at Cheadle and Gatley, he was definitely a standout player by a mile at that young age,\" Steve Vare, who is still involved with the Stockport club, told the MEN.",
      "\"It was all a bit too easy and I was trying to make it more difficult to test him. His dad asked whether he would be pushed up into some of the teams, a couple of ages ahead of himself.\"",
      "But before joining United's academy aged nine, Mainoo's father, Felix, searched for a team that was good enough to challenge him and somewhere he could play up an age group.",
      "Mainoo joined Failsworth Dynamos and he was coached by Ian Kelly, who also spoke to the MEN last year after the youngster made his United debut against Charlton Athletic.",
      "\"I'd play Kobbie on the wing or in midfield,\" he said. \"The lad I had up front scored most of the goals but Kobbie chipped in a lot. He was quick, so he was really good on the wing.",
      "\"But if you did put him in the middle, he could shoot and move the ball forward. We'd always win the league, we played for cups and we'd win those, we won 'the treble' in his last season.",
      "\"There was one team visit to a tournament in Blackpool when we stayed over and I had a drink with Kobbie's dad, who is a really good bloke. He's a funny guy and we had a real laugh.",
      "\"We won that tournament and beat an academy side in the final. We also went down to Manchester City, a scout wanted us to play their team, and we only got beat by a goal. The scout said we've never had a team that's come here and given them a game.\"",
      "Mainoo went to both United and City's academies when he was a child and in another world, he's just broken into the starting team at the Etihad under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Fortunately for United, Mainoo chose to join their academy and although City have attempted to lure him away when it would have been possible, he's chosen to stay each time.",
      "A report emerged in November suggesting City were planning to make a move for Mainoo, but United were relaxed because their admiration of the player isn't anything new.",
      "Something disastrous would have to happen for Mainoo to defect from red to blue and he's got the potential to be a player United build their midfield around for the next 10 years.",
      "Mainoo has started 11 of United's 12 games across all competitions in 2024 and his Instagram followers practically doubled when he scored the winning goal in the 4-3 win over Wolves.",
      "He conducted his first external media duties after that victory at Molineux Stadium and when he returned to the dressing room, he received a loud ovation from his teammates.",
      "Just a few weeks before that game, Mainoo had been shopping - he enjoys fashion - in Manchester and he modestly remarked that nobody in the city would recognise him.",
      "Although that was unlikely to be true at the time, it's certainly not true now. Mainoo is already adored by United fans and he recently pulled over in his car, despite being at the start of a roundabout, to sign autographs for young fans who had waved him down.",
      "Additionally, he made a heartwarming gesture when inviting a supporter and his son to Old Trafford, following the loss of a family member, whose last game watching United before passing away was against Wolves when he scored the late match-winning goal.",
      "Those small gestures show that Mainoo 'gets it' and it's why he's quickly become a fan favourite. There's no feeling like watching a player from United's academy perform on the biggest stage and he's equally admired among his peers, who have been taken by his talent, at the club.",
      "Casemiro has said United could have 'a top player for years', Bruno Fernandes has said 'he's got so much quality' and Rasmus Hojlund has described him as a 'generational talent'.",
      "A source also told the MEN that Mainoo 'loves to play with Casemiro' because the Brazilian's defensive discipline gives him the licence to take up more advanced positions.",
      "Mainoo's long-term future will lie in the No.8 midfield role and he's enjoyed working alongside the 32-year-old, who has given him advice and pointers during training sessions.",
      "Although the Stockport-born lad signed a long-term contract in February 2023, it's understood initial discussions have taken place over a new deal to reflect his growing importance.",
      "Naturally, he will receive a wage increase if he signs a new deal, but the MEN understands that all parties are relaxed about the situation and there is no rush to accelerate talks, with the player keen to focus on his United performances for the remainder of the season.",
      "The performance-related bonuses in Mainoo's current contract have been triggered, which is why there is no panic from the player's camp to urgently push for a new deal.",
      "Mainoo has made headlines again this week after he was promoted to the senior England squad. He was initially supposed to spend the international break with the Three Lions' Under-21s and his call-up came as a surprise because Gareth Southgate didn't contact him after the Liverpool game.",
      "The surprise made the promotion an even sweeter moment to savour and Mainoo couldn't wipe the smile from his face when speaking to England's in-house media team.",
      "The player had been weighing up his options about whether to represent England or Ghana and he is proud of his family roots, but he's been advised to lean toward the Three Lions.",
      "England are set to play Brazil and Belgium in international friendlies across the next few days and Mainoo receiving a cameo in either game would represent yet another milestone.",
      "Just over 18 months ago, someone close to Mainoo boldly predicted it was a matter of when, not if, he would play for England and that confidence was not misplaced.",
      "Mainoo seems to be the real deal and he's a Red through and through.",

      "The summer transfer window is just around the corner, so which positions should Man United prioritise strengthening?",
      "Manchester United's summer spending will be hugely affected by whether they qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League at the end of the season.",
      "United are nine points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa in the table but they have a game in hand to play and fifth could be enough to qualify for the Champions League this term.",
      "Two leagues will be rewarded with an extra Champions League place for 2024/25 and it looks increasingly likely the Premier League will receive another slot for the competition.",
      "United's budget for the summer transfer window will be impacted if they fail to secure qualification and fans are dreading the possibility of competing in the Europa League again.",
      "It would make attracting some of the world's best players difficult and there are a few positions in the team that need to be strengthened with high-quality recruits.",
      "Many expect Casemiro to leave the club, but the MEN have been told Kobbie Mainoo 'loves' to play with the Brazilian and perhaps signing a new No.6 would help unlock his full potential.",
      "Finding a replacement for Casemiro seems to be high on the agenda among supporters, so we asked our writers to pick which three positions they think should be addressed in the summer...",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "If we're only going for three positions then for me it has to be the spine of the team. A central defender, midfielder and a striker. Starting at the back, there will be changes there this summer and with departures likely a new face is required. Jarrad Branthwaite has been outstanding for Everton and looks a long-term bet at centre-half. Comfortable with both feet, tall and physically strong, he ticks every box for a Premier League centre-back.",
      "I would look to replace Casemiro as well and shift the 32-year-old out to sign a new holding midfielder. With Mainoo and Fernandes in place it is the defensive midfielder that needs to be slotted into this system and Casemiro's performances this season have raised concerns about how long he has left at the highest level.",
      "With Anthony Martial departing this summer another striker is also a necessity. Rasmus Hojlund looks ready to make the No.9 shirt his own but at the very least he needs some support and competition. His improvement this year means signing another £60million striker shouldn't be required, but United need to find a bargain that can come in and challenge the Dane.",
      "George Smith",
      "If United are to prioritise strengthening three positions this forthcoming summer, they need to be centre-back, central midfield and the centre of attack. Starting at centre-back, only Lisandro Martinez from United's current pool of centre-backs is guaranteed a starting berth ahead of next season amid uncertainty concerning Raphael Varane's future.",
      "If Varane departs, United need to find a starter for the right-sided centre-back berth. Though he is left-footed, Branthwaite is very much capable of playing on that side of the centre-half partnership. He has excelled this season and looks as though he is ready to establish himself as a top-level centre-back.",
      "It is a similar story in midfield, in the sense that United need to recruit someone to come in and start week in, week out. Mainoo and Fernandes are staples in midfield, meaning the Reds need a player who can provide balance in the defensive role. They need a younger version of the Casemiro they saw last season.",
      "In attack, however, United should not be in the market for a star-studded No.9. They recruited Hojlund last term to become the face of their forward line for years to come and he should only get better. That means they should be shopping for a budget striker who can provide a sense of competition for the Dane.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "After reading what my colleagues, Tyrone and George, had written, I wanted to pick at least one different position to strengthen, but doing that would make me look quite stupid.",
      "United needed two strikers last summer and they only signed Hojlund. Another forward to share the goalscoring burden is needed, especially since Martial will leave in the summer.",
      "Casemiro has looked like a player in the winter of his career and he's struggled to play a 10-yard pass over the last few weeks. He lost possession 17 times overall in his most recent appearance against Everton and only Ben Godfrey lost it more among all outfield players.",
      "An upgrade on Casemiro would be ideal and signing another centre-back is advisable considering Varane and Jonny Evans are out of contact, Harry Maguire's future is uncertain and Martinez has suffered a few injuries. It's boring for each writer to agree in a panel like this but it does show where the money should be invested.",

      "Man Utd have some difficult decisions to make over some of their forwards this summer and they need to bring at least one new face in as well.",
      "Two of the most pressing decisions facing those heading up the new football structure at Manchester United this summer concern attacking players currently not at the club.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood are playing their football in Germany and Spain respectively, having been declared persona non grata at Old Trafford. But there isn't an option to make the move permanent in either deal and they will return to the club with their futures uncertain.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the footballing department that is set to be headed up by Dan Ashworth will have a decision to make on both and they will have to judge each case individually. Ratcliffe left the door ajar for Greenwood when he met journalists shortly after his stake in United had been confirmed, but it's difficult to see a way back for the academy graduate.",
      "This really should be the easiest decision facing United this summer. The club have already attempted to reintegrate the forward once and it proved impossible. A permanent departure to another La Liga club is the only possible solution and it's a move that should be completed as soon as possible. As an academy graduate any fee that United bank will be beneficial to their Profit and Sustainability calculations.",
      "The case around Sancho is more difficult to decipher. The 23-year-old has rediscovered some form, confidence and enjoyment for the game back at Borussia Dortmund. There is an obvious temptation to try and bring him back into the squad.",
      "Whether that is possible will depend on at least a couple of factors. Firstly, whether Erik ten Hag remains in charge. Neither Sancho nor Ten Hag has given an inch in their dispute which began at the start of September and it feels like only one can possibly remain at United next season. Even if Ten Hag departs, it will require Sancho to want to try and succeed at Old Trafford again.",
      "He will have to put the work in to do so. There is competition for places out wide, with Alejandro Garnacho excelling on the right and Marcus Rashford finding form again on the left. Antony is another expensive option and Mason Mount might be used in the front three at times next season, given his midfield slot has been taken by Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Then there is Amad. The 21-year-old has barely had a chance this season but he took his opportunity against Liverpool last weekend and there is a talented player there. If Sancho does depart he might get another year to prove himself, but he does need more opportunities over the remainder of this season.",
      "Facundo Pellistri was signed in the same window as Amad and has played the more first-team games of the two, but he should be the one guaranteed to depart this summer. He is 22 now and hasn't done enough to suggest he is good enough for United.",
      "Rashford's return to goalscoring form is a welcome bonus for United after a testing few months, while Garnacho's status as a winger capable of starting and influencing every game is now secured. Antony's goal against Liverpool last weekend was badly needed and he will surely get another season at the club, but he needs to show considerable improvement.",
      "One new attacking signing will be guaranteed, however, with Anthony Martial to leave when his contract expires this summer. The Frenchman hasn't kicked a ball since December 9 due to injury and his time is up. United need another striker who can supplement Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Dane's form since finally breaking his Premier League duck on Boxing Day has been excellent and at 21 he now looks capable of leading the attack. He has 13 goals in 31 games in all competitions but eight in nine more recently and there have been enough glimpses of his talent to believe the £72million spent on him might yet prove to be a good investment.",
      "He needs support, however. United didn't expect him to be leading the line every week this season but that is what happened when fit. He is still learning his trade and the priority this summer has to be signing another striker.",
      "Hojlund's recent form means that doesn't have to be an elite No. 9 costing a fortune, such as Victor Osimhen. United should be able to shop in the bracket below that, for a striker capable of coming off the bench and influencing games and starting when required to give Hojlund a rest.",
      "Like every area of this squad, there are decisions to be made in attack this summer and departures are inevitable. But with Rashford, 26, Hojlund, 21, and Garnacho, 19, in the squad, there is also plenty of promise for the future.",
      "Release: Martial",
      "Sell: Greenwood, Pellistri",

      "One high-profile midfielder chose to leave Sir Alex Ferguson's Man Utd regime - and ended up regretting it.",
      "It wasn't often a player left Manchester United out of choice under Sir Alex Ferguson, and very few left to join a rival team.",
      "Both David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo left for another country amid their transfers to European counterparts Real Madrid while Carlos Tevez, of course, is remembered for that infamous cross-city switch in 2009. Juan Sebastian Veron also makes that short list.",
      "He left for Chelsea in 2003 in one of Roman Abramovich’s first signings as club owner. The Argentine only enjoyed two years at Old Trafford before making the decision to leave. He scored 11 times in 82 appearances and took his leave after lifting the Premier League title. Veron moved to United for a British transfer record, arriving at Old Trafford for £28.1million.",
      "\"I think I've always searched for this,\" Sir Alex Ferguson declared upon Veron's unveiling. \"I never thought I'd spend this much money on a footballer.",
      "“You've seen the escalation and it's unthinkable but it is a matter between clubs nowadays and the players have no say about the values placed on them. I think he's coming into great years of his career and he will peak and we'll get the benefit of that. He is a world-class, fantastic footballer with a vision of a game we can use.\"",
      "Like all United players, Veron admired Sir Alex. Speaking in 2021, the midfielder spoke glowingly of the great man and unpacked how his style of management kept standards at a peak level.",
      "Veron said: “He was so demanding with everybody. If you couldn’t keep up, it was clear you would have to look elsewhere. He was always forthright with me, but he had my back from day one, which was very much appreciated.",
      "“At some points, I wasn’t able to give him everything he expected from me consistently. He got it in a few matches but not in others, and if you want to be a great player, your game has to be stable. I couldn’t deliver it at Old Trafford.”",
      "Veron found it hard to settle in at United and ended up scoring just five times in 40 matches in his debut season. Questions were starting to be raised about his price tag ahead of the run-in and a report had claimed teammates had squared up to Veron for his poor displays after a Champions League semi-final defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Ferguson hit back during a press conference. \"It's absolute nonsense, total lies,” he insisted, before later adding: \"On you go. I’m not f****** talking to you. He’s a f****** great player. You are f****** idiots. He’s a f****** great player... you are all f****** idiots.”",
      "However, Veron knew he wasn’t at top tilt. He admitted that things away from the football pitch impacted what happened when he was on it.",
      "\"It was a big change of culture for us,\" he said when speaking about how his family had to adapt to life in England.",
      "\"We'd been happy living in Italy, but the people in Manchester helped us adjust. The best thing was the people, in the club, in the street. We lived in Hale.",
      "\"It was tranquil, there was a small forest nearby, and we liked it. Roy Keane – the captain and a top player in a group where standards were high - lived near me.",
      "\"There were people in the dressing room who spoke Italian and Spanish. Mikael Silvestre spoke Italian, Laurent Blanc too. Quinton Fortune spoke Spanish, while Diego Forlan would arrive and he spoke Spanish. And El Mister [Ferguson] tried to speak Spanish! People at Carrington always had a word for me in Spanish.\"",
      "Veron added: “The language barrier was an issue for me, but I had very friendly relationships with my teammates. That said, it was probably an issue in my social life outside the club. That was my fault – I’ve never enjoyed studying in my life!",
      "“Obviously United provided an English teacher for me, but I took a couple of classes and then gave it up. Maybe at that age I bet everything on the football side of things, and underestimated the value of personality off the pitch. Now, I can see that it would have been worthwhile to engage with some of my teammates socially as well.”",
      "Football, though, only has one language and all can understand it. Veron was often played alongside Paul Scholes, a player whom he had a lot of respect for.",
      "“It was a pleasure to train and share moments with all of them. But if I had to pick only one, it would be Scholes,” Veron once said. “He was the full package. He could recover the ball, attack and shoot extremely well, and he was clever – a terrific reader of the game. He had everything.”",
      "Speaking in 2022, Scholes spoke about his time on the field with Veron. He said he struggled to play his best game due to both of them having the same internal desire to push up and help the attack.",
      "“It wasn't great playing with people who - attacking people - I needed someone who played that [defensive midfield] position really well,\" Scholes said.",
      "“Me and Veron were a disaster. I think me and Anderson did it once - just, no, it's not working, is it? [laughs] Just two lads who don't care about defending. It worked better with a Michael or a Roy or a Nicky, who were brilliant playing a position they knew.”",
      "Veron perhaps knew this himself. He realised big things were expected of him after his move from Lazio where he had thrived. But it just would not click at Old Trafford.",
      "Veron conceded: “I know that people expected a lot from me in England – and I did, let me make that clear. Perhaps it was something related to the characteristics of the players; if the club really needed me, in a position where there were decent options already.",
      "“To make things work for me, the side – which was doing well – had to be changed. If there was one thing that played against me, I’d say it was the physical conditioning.",
      "\"I was used to the Italian way, which was key for our game, but in England during that time, the physical conditioning was to play games. I wasn’t used to playing without intense preparation, and it wasn’t ideal for me in the long term.",
      "“As we played more matches, my performance levels dropped. I had so many ups and downs, a few really good games, but other poor ones. In Italy I managed to have a more stable spell.”",
      "The opportunity at Chelsea soon arose. Abramovich was looking to have a statement window and put markers down. He splashed £111m in his first summer.",
      "Veron went for £15m, with United losing out on £13m from their original purchase fee. The switch to Stamford Bridge was not an easy one, though.",
      "Veron’s father, Juan Ramón Veron, had scored the winning goal at Old Trafford for Argentine club Estudiantes against a United side containing George Best, Denis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup match-up.",
      "It is a connection that was clearly close to Sebastian. \"Football has this magical way of connecting stories, and it took me to Manchester United, where I was completely honoured to meet those legendary players,” he said.",
      "“It was an incredible experience. The story of that match in 1968 is a fairy tale: a giant against a humble club. Those games definitely helped to shape the DNA of Estudiantes. They were much spicier than today’s matches, too.",
      "\"When United first invited me to Old Trafford, I was shown the main memorabilia of that game in their museum – an Estudiantes pennant with my dad’s image on it. I got quite moved once I saw that.”",
      "Veron was pondering whether to give up his United colours for the blue of Chelsea. He decided to make the move against the advice of some personal acquaintances - and regrets doing so.",
      "In 2019, he explained: “At Chelsea, the reality is that I had very little time. I had a major back injury and I was out for practically six months. I was already thinking more about going back to Italy than staying there in England.",
      "“With United, the truth is that there are few things, very few, that I regret. But one is to have left Manchester. They never pushed me or told me 'You have to go' but they gave me the chance, the possibility.",
      "“I had talks with my former colleagues at that time telling me that I had to stay. And at one moment I decided to leave because I wanted to play because I didn't know... I should have stayed.”",
      "Ahead of the World Cup in 2010, he had taken a slightly different tone. He made it clear he was not a fan of his time in the Premier League.",
      "“I wandered around Europe like a gypsy, without ever finding happiness or somebody who understood me,” he said. “That's why I went back to Estudiantes. I was tired of being a wanderer.",
      "“England has a spectacular Premier League but that's it. They don't train very much and there were no proper warm-ups at Manchester United. Paul Scholes would turn up and fire off a shot, without warming up, from 50 metres towards the goal even when it was minus five degrees.",
      "“I did that once and I pulled a muscle from my knee to my hip. I was never happy in England and my time there made me question my desire to continue playing.”",
      "Post-retirement he spoke of whether his move to the Reds was a regret of his.",
      "“No, never. I signed for United because I had a passport issue in Italy and thought a change of scenery would be good for my mind.",
      "“Truth be told, I had a pessimistic view about playing in England, as I imagined that life there would be so different to what I was used to: the Latin lifestyle. But I found an extraordinary club. You could hardly find one as well-organised, with so many people willing to help.",
      "“Everything that happened to me there changed my mind [about England]. I had two great years in Manchester, winning the Premier League title, and I’m still in touch with several of the guys I met: Dwight Yorke, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand, Quinton Fortune, Wes Brown, John O’Shea. I met Gary and Phil Neville again at some point, too.”",
      "Neville has been very complimentary of Veron’s career despite his difficulties at United. In 2020, he named him in his all-time overseas United XI.",
      "He said: \"Juan Sebastian Veron was an amazing player. In my opinion, it didn’t happen for him [at United] because I think we had the best midfield English football has ever produced, and I think will ever produce. [Ryan] Giggs, [Roy] Keane, Scholes, Becks. I think these four players are the best Manchester United have ever had.",
      "\"The midfield four played in what I would call a methodical way. They played a disciplined role, and it was a classic 4-4-2. The way Veron played, coming out of Italy, he moved into different positions and was fluid, trying to get the ball from the left-back.",
      "“He was almost the first player who broke the code. The code had to break at some point. Veron came in with that interchanging mindset, but into a team that was set into its patterns.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Chelsea in recent years, Veron said: “It was the start of the club’s transformation, and we reached a stage [the Champions League semi-finals in 2003/04, losing to Monaco] that many people didn’t expect us to achieve.",
      "“I felt that going to Chelsea could have been a good chance for me to get a longer sequence of matches, but I shouldn’t have gone there. I don’t say that because of Chelsea, though.",
      "\"It’s nice to have a club wanting to sign you, excited that you can do something for them. To make an investment like that, the club has to believe in you and trust you.",
      "“I actually found it tougher to live in London than Manchester because I’m from La Plata, which is quite a small city. I wish I could have stayed at United longer, as I believe I could have done things differently. If I’d stayed in Manchester, I think I would have had more continuity on the pitch.”",
      "In his four years at Chelsea, Veron played just 14 matches. Injury hampered his debut season before a two-year loan spell was agreed with Inter. Eventually he returned to home comforts back at boyhood club Estudiantes, where he would retire before becoming vice-president.",
      "Veron finished up with 72 Argentina caps, more than 570 club matches and a plethora of silverware across five clubs in three countries, although only one of those came in England. It’s clear which club he regretted leaving most.",

      "The 29-year-old is one of the finest chance creators in the Premier League and he contributes goals throughout the season. However, Erik ten Hag has chosen to play Fernandes on the right wing and in a deeper midfield role on a few occasions during his time as manager.",

      "Manchester United will be looking to upgrade their midfield department this summer with several names linked",
      "As Manchester United approach the end of the 2023/24 season, attention will soon turn towards the summer transfer market.",
      "It promises to be an intriguing period for Erik ten Hag, or his potential replacement, as the Reds look to clear out their squad and head in a different direction on and off the pitch. The recent arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe is set to bolster United's spending power and help attract the right profile of player to go about rebuilding the team.",
      "Joao Gomes and Amadou Onana are two of the names that have been mentioned as possible arrivals in the midfield department, with Leicester City's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall also linked. With that in mind, we have assessed how the trio could assist Kobbie Mainoo and who would best complement the England youngster using data provided by FBref.",
      "From an attacking point of view, Dewsbury-Hall is the player who leads the way in this area after scoring ten times in the Championship this term. By contrast, Gomes and Onana are tied on two each. Mainoo has a solitary strike to his name, which arrived in stunning style in a last-gasp away win at Wolves.",
      "Dewsbury-Hall remains out in front when it comes to shot-creating actions (passes, take-ons, drawing fouls), averaging 5.07 per 90 minutes played. He has, too, made 28 goal-creating actions, and is leading in this category by some distance (Mainoo 4, Gomes 4, Onana 0). The Leicester City star has played more match minutes than Onana, Mainoo and Gomes due to competing in the second tier, though such numbers are nonetheless impressive.",
      "Defensive actions is the area in which Gomes takes control, making nearly double the number of tackles as Dewsbury-Hall (83 vs 42) despite having played 12 fewer league games. The Wolves enforcer is also superior regarding blocks (42) and interceptions (17).",
      "Dewsbury-Hall again excels when in possession of the ball and averages 2.49 take-ons per game, compared to Mainoo's 2.03, Onana's 1.19 and Gomes' 1.49. The Englishman is currently completing 3.93 progressive carries (bringing the ball to the opponent's goal line at least ten yards from its furthest point) of the ball per game and is not even close to being caught by those in this comparison (Mainoo 0.81, Gomes 0.64, Onana 0.97).",
      "While Onana has fallen short in the majority of the aforementioned categories, the Everton midfielder reigns supreme with aerial duals. The Belgian has won 74.6% of his battles in the air, compared to Mainoo's 55.2%, Dewsbury-Hall's 47.9% and Gomes' 48.3%.",
      "Taking the above into account, Dewsbury-Hall could well be the option to consider to provide some attacking threat to support Mainoo's defensive-minded style. Leicester's recent profit and sustainability charge and transfer embargo could result in their star players leaving, providing United with an opportunity to strike a deal.",

      "Antony scored in Man United's dramatic 4-3 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals last weekend.",
      "Antony has hailed the support of Manchester United teammate Diogo Dalot, admitting he told him ahead of last weekend's FA Cup quarter-final victory over Liverpool that he was going to score.",
      "After stepping off the bench with 71 minutes on the clock to replace Rasmus Hojlund, the Brazilian plundered his first Old Trafford goal in more than 12 months to make it 2-2 and send the contest to extra-time. He turned sharply inside the penalty area and fired an instinctive finish on his weaker right foot.",
      "United, of course, won the contest in extra-time, scoring through Marcus Rashford, who made it 3-3, and Amad. As a reward, they will now face Coventry City in the last four at Wembley next month.",
      "Despite struggling to make an impact at Old Trafford since his arrival from Ajax in September 2022, Antony has refused to lose faith in his hopes of making his mark in England. And he has admitted that Dalot has played a key role in keeping his spirits up, insisting he is 'more than a friend'.",
      "\"I'm very grateful to God and to a friend I talk to a lot,\" said Antony, as quoted by United's club website. \"Diogo Dalot is more than a friend to me, he's a guy who helps me every day at the club.",
      "\"We have a phrase that we always say to each other: the patient guy is unbeatable. We always talk about it. So I'm very grateful to him for his advice, for the moments we had together talking. He's a guy who's helped me a lot.",
      "\"Before the game, I told Diogo that I felt something different. I felt something good. I felt I was going to score today, so I'm very happy about that.",
      "\"With regard to Dalot, as I said, he's my best friend here at the club. He's a guy we're always talking to, he's always advising me and his mentality is out of the ordinary.\"",

      "Manchester United prospect Facundo Pellistri has admitted he is 'sad' how his loan spell at Granada has played out as the Spanish side continue their battle against relegation.",
      "Pellistri was sent on loan to Granada in January for the remainder of the current campaign and has started the last six La Liga matches for his side, scoring and assisting in 3-3 draw against Barcelona in the process. The Uruguayan was allowed to leave Old Trafford on a temporary basis after struggling for regular game time and has now been provided with the opportunity to impress on a more regular basis.",
      "Still awaiting his first win at the club, Pellistri has been unable to help revive Granada's season and the club appears destined for relegation. They currently sit 13 points adrift of escaping the drop zone and have only ten matches remaining in their season.",
      "Opening up on his experience of representing his temporary employers and his disappointment over their league position, Pellistri told ESPN: \"At the club, we are going through a complicated time, but football is like that: there are good and bad moments and you have to be ready to change your mentality and bring good energy here. When I return to the club, we must continue with the best energy to meet the objectives, and try to do our best.",
      "\"I am accumulating a lot of minutes in Granada. I am happy about that part, but sad about how the level of the group is going. We all want to achieve the objective, there are still chances: as long as those chances are there, we are going to continue fighting.\"",
      "The comments from the 22-year-old come after his agent, Edgardo Lasalvia, aimed a subtle dig at United boss Erik ten Hag. He appeared to suggest that it would be \"difficult\" for his client to continue at Old Trafford if the Dutchman remained in charge due to his limited game time.",
      "Pellistri responded to claims over his relationship with the Dutchman earlier this month and said of his move away from Manchester: \"Although I had minutes at Manchester United, it was not the amount I would like given the moment I was in. I am very happy for the minutes I played here.",
      "\"A player always wants to play, many times one does not put oneself into the manager's decisions, who has to think about many more things. Many times the player does not know what the coach is thinking or why he makes the decisions he makes.",
      "\"United were not winning games. When a great team enters that situation everything becomes more difficult and day-to-day life is more complicated. Now it has picked up a little and hopefully at the end of the season the goal of reaching the Champions League will be achieved. When a player goes out on loan it is to look for minutes, gain continuity and try to gain confidence.\"",

      "The 23-year-old has made 11 appearances in all competitions but he's widely expected to have a bright future in the game. United are believed to have inserted a buy-back clause with a right of first refusal in the deal with Leverkusen, which means he could return to Manchester one day.",

      "Paul Gascoigne was the hottest prospect in the transfer market in 1988 but after sending Sir Alex Ferguson off on holiday with a move to Man United agreed, he had a sudden change of heart.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was in Malta when he read the bad news - a holiday cut short in the worst possible way.",
      "It was the summer of 1988 and Paul Gascoigne had agreed to join Tottenham after Newcastle United's £2.2million valuation had been met, but they weren't the first to do so. Manchester United had already put their cash on the table.",
      "\"Can I go on holiday knowing that I've signed you, Gazza?” Ferguson asked over the phone. The response was an outright yes but this deal was far from done, and it never got done at all.",
      "Ferguson was in his early years as United manager in the late 1980s and was keen to bring in that kind of talent that won matches and titles. It was during a game against Newcastle in 1987 that he first laid eyes on that exact player.",
      "Managed by Willie McFaul, the Magpies had been meandering in the lower half of the First Division but they had a star in their ranks by the name of Paul Gascoigne. The then-20-year-old was famously fuelled by Mars Bars and Newcastle Brown Ale but ran United's midfield trio of Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside and Remi Moses ragged.",
      "Admittedly, no one in that era was a model of physical fitness but Gascoigne did things to that United midfield that few had done before. Ferguson set his sights on the midfielder who would go on to be crowned PFA Young Player of the Year and listed in the PFA Team of the Year that season.",
      "Such was Ferguson's desire to sign Gascoigne that he spoke to the mercurial midfielder himself, selling the United project. And he had worked his magic, the pair agreeing a deal will be formalised and Ferguson could head on his summer holidays.",
      "After agreeing what looked to be the move of his dreams, Gascoigne took the summer to unwind back in his hometown, catching up with old friends before heading south to Manchester. It was during that time that he went for a drink with then-Tottenham man Chris Waddle.",
      "“I went up to the North East one weekend,” Waddle told FourFourTwo recently. “Terry had given me an additional day off and said that if I saw my pal up there, to have a word about him potentially coming to Tottenham, because everyone knew he was leaving Newcastle.",
      "“I got in touch with Gazza and arranged to meet in a pub at midday on the Sunday. He strolled in with his entourage, all his mates. I asked him who he was going to sign for and he replied, ‘Manchester United’. I said, ‘Why don’t you come to Spurs?’ I told him he could get lost in London and no one would find out half the stuff he’d do. If he moved to United, he’d have Alex Ferguson on his case all of the time, along with some senior players. I said Terry Venables was really knowledgeable and would look after him.",
      "“He said, no, he was still off to Manchester United. I said, ‘Fair enough’ and wished him the best of luck. I left the pub, then he came out with his friends shouting, ‘Waddler, see you at White Hart Lane on Monday!’ I thought he was joking around, but when I returned to London on the Tuesday, I was told Gazza had been at the club the previous day and signed a contract.\"",
      "Gascoigne may not have made his mind up that day but his chat with Waddle certainly planted a seed of doubt. The midfielder was on his way to Old Trafford when then-Tottenham chairman Irving Scholar called.",
      "In what is now an infamous series of events, Scholar attempted to woo Gascoigne with several add-ons, including a house for his family, a white BMW for his dad and even a sunbed for his sister. And so the in-demand midfielder swerved away from Manchester and headed down to London.",
      "Ferguson wrote a letter to Gascoigne in fury, lamenting the Geordie boy for turning down the biggest club in the world and labelling him a 'silly boy'. The Reds boss had been crossed and that is not taken lightly.",
      "Gascoigne's scintillating form over the following two campaigns would earn him a place in Sir Bobby Robson's squad for Italia '90, where he would become a household name across the country. Upon returning, he helped Tottenham reach the 1990/1991 FA Cup final but in the first of many cruel twists, he tore knee ligaments in a reckless challenge and was taken off in a stretcher.",
      "The England star missed out on regular football - his only true release - for over a year and that, coupled with his growing public image and the scrutiny that came with it, led to off-field issues. Gascoigne has been open about previous issues with alcohol and drugs, and found himself in undesirable circles during his three years at Lazio.",
      "Gascoigne became almost unmanageable in Italy but one person who could have kept him on the straight and narrow was Ferguson. It was a huge regret of the eccentric playmaker, who believes he could have followed the path of other England stars who played under the Scot.",
      "\"Maybe if I had stayed at Man United I might have still been there,\" Gascoigne told Sky News in 2009. \"I don't know, you just look at these players and the squad of young kids that play, young Rooney that's there, the Neville brothers and Becks, the way he [Ferguson] just brought them on and there are so many.",
      "\"It took me six years to get back talking to Sir Alex, I called him from Lazio and asked him would he re-sign us. He was with Eric Cantona and he said he would see what Cantona was going to do but I think everyone knows if you do something to Sir Alex Ferguson the way I did you don't get a second chance.\"",
      "The paths of both Ferguson and Gascoigne suggest it would be the latter who harbours regret. United went on to enjoy unprecedented success with their new manager, dominating the Premier League era and adding a couple of Champions League trophies to boot.",
      "But it's hard not to imagine what the United side of the early 1990s - that of Cantona, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole - might have achieved with a Gascoigne thrown in there as well. As much as anything, it would have been one of Ferguson's biggest tests in management, and a hugely rewarding one had he got it right.",
      "\"In reality, you have to say, there's only one that always comes to my mind and that's Gascoigne,\" Ferguson told the UTD Podcast when asked which signing he regrets missing out on. \"He was absolutely fantastic. I think if we'd have got him, he would have had a great career, I really do.\"",

And after a difficult start to this season he is beginning to rediscover his form in front of goal, although he was only a substitute for England in their Wembley defeat to Brazil on Saturday.",
      "But Owen believes Rashford's pace could offer another threat for England, alongside the combination play of the other forwards in the teams.",
      "\"If we don’t have someone like Rashford, then I don’t think we have masses and masses of pace to frighten the life out of anyone,\" Owen told Instant Casinos. \"I think when you have a combination of the likes of Bellingham, Foden and Saka and then you have the raw pace of Rashford, teams won’t know whether they are coming or going.",
      "\"You won’t be able to defend for pace or against pockets. To defend against pockets you have got to play a couple of tight lines, which then gives space in behind unless you’re playing very very deep and then you’re just going to be playing into England’s hands in many ways.",
      "\"So it’s lovely to have a combination of pace and skill and I think with Rashford in there we certainly tick a massive box of having pace. Alternatives, who have we got? If we play two sixes then it takes away one of our top players and I think it’s overkill.",

      "Who should United appoint to replace Ten Hag, should Ratcliffe decide to pull the trigger? It is a question that has no obvious answer.",
      "When United were hunting for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's permanent successor, Ten Hag, along with Mauricio Pochettino, was one of just two leading candidates. This time, a scattering of names have been linked with the job, but there is not a clear-cut, obvious favourite.",
      "Mentions of Southgate's name have been met with discontent. As good a job as he has done with England over the last few years, he would not be an upgrade on Ten Hag.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is understood to have admirers within the Ineos Group and has been linked with the impending vacancy along the M62 at Anfield. However, once again, he would not necessarily be an upgrade on Ten Hag.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, United have worked their way through five permanent managers, ranging from established, big-name figures to a club icon. They have also had temporary stints under Ryan Giggs, Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "After working their way through four managers, two of whom were permanent figures, between May 2016 and May 2022, Ten Hag's arrival in M16 signalled the beginning of a new dawn, featuring a long-term plan. Ten Hag was not expected to lead United to a title charge last season, meaning the third-placed finish they did achieve in 2022/23 was very respectable.",
      "Arsenal have demonstrated that sticking with Mikel Arteta has reaped its rewards, with the club in the thick of the title race for the second season running. Patience is often required at big clubs, even if some supporters are not willing to wait, such is the constant clamour for success.",
      "Ten Hag is still in the process of implementing a long-term plan in M16, and he deserves the opportunity to try and stick to that ambition with the support of a better off-field model. Plus, there are absolutely no guarantees a change in the dugout would speed up United's hopes of competing with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City again.",
      "From the position United were in when Ten Hag arrived, lifting the Carabao Cup and finishing third in the Premier League resembled a successful maiden season for the Dutchman last term. United, after a slow start, improved as the season unfolded and were the best of the rest, just as the league table confirmed.",
      "United played some excellent football at times, rediscovering an identity that had been missing. Several members of the squad enjoyed stellar individual campaigns, such as Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford and Casemiro.",
      "This season, Ten Hag has had to contend with a mountain of injuries, meaning he has been unable to rely on a settled XI. Any manager would feel the impact of that.",
      "Had the likes of Martinez and Shaw, for example, been fit all season, United would almost certainly be in a better position than where they are now. If United can keep the likes of those players fit next season, and add quality to the squad, they should kick on.",
      "If last weekend's victory over Liverpool demonstrated anything, it was that this group of players are prepared to run through a brick wall for their manager. The squad's character has been just as important as their footballing ability recently, highlighted by the way in which they have beaten the likes of Wolves, Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.",
      "They have kept going right until the final whistle, refusing to throw in the towel. Ten Hag has regularly praised the mentality of his players in recent weeks and it has been easy to understand why.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been pictured countless times with Ten Hag at the end of matches recently, each donning huge smiles on their faces, suggesting he still has complete faith in the Dutchman. His sharp rise, along with Kobbie Mainoo, is a result of Ten Hag installing huge amounts of faith and trust in him.",
      "Ten Hag, ultimately, has got far more right than wrong during his United tenure, often in the midst of having to contend with off-field sagas and distractions. He deserves at least one season, at the very minimum, under the new regime.",

      "Man Utd will look to reshape their defence this summer and they have plenty of options to do just that in terms of sales and signings.",
      "No area of the pitch has been as unsettled this season as Manchester United's defence, a claim that the stats bear out. Seven different defenders have played more than 1,000 minutes this term, a number that doesn't include Lisandro Martinez, who will expect to reach that tally if he can remain injury-free between now and the end of May.",
      "Four central defenders have played between 1,274 minutes and 2,010 minutes, but not one of them is in the top seven for playing time this season, which tells a story. Most clubs will have a centre-back towards the top of that list because it is often the most settled area of the team.",
      "William Saliba and Gabriel are top of the minutes played chart at Arsenal. Virgil van Dijk is top for Liverpool and Ruben Dias is fifth for Manchester City, but with 800 more minutes than Raphael Varane, who is United's most-used centre-back.",
      "So deciphering what exactly is Erik ten Hag's first-choice back four isn't easy. It's even more complicated when looking ahead to the summer and the uncertainty that clouds the defence, in the centre especially. The only centre-back guaranteed to remain at the club is Martinez.",
      "Ten Hag has placed some of the blame for United's defensive issues this season on the fact he has had to make so many changes at the back and has struggled to field a settled rearguard.",
      "“We have had to change the defence every time [this season],” he said in January. “If you look at last season, we had a very good back four, very consistent, and we had control. This season, we always have to make adjustments at the back, there are no more automatisms and the middle is too open.”",
      "He will hope that will change next season but what is certain to change is the identity of the players available for selection. Varane might have played more than any other central defender this term, but he is out of contract this summer and is yet to sign a new deal.",
      "The World Cup winner's injury record counts against him, he was dropped by Ten Hag for a chunk of the season and commands a significant wage for a 30-year-old. Ineos might decide it is time to move on.",
      "Victor Lindelof is next on the list and he has performed admirably as a stand-in left-back at times this season. But he turns 30 in July and after seven seasons and more than 250 appearances for the club, it might also be time to move on. The age profile feels telling in defence, with Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans also the wrong side of 30. At least two of Varane, Lindelof, Maguire and Evans need to be moved on this summer.",
      "Evans, 36, has played more often than anyone expected and has proved a reliable performer. His deal expires in the summer as well but United could make a late call on the former academy graduate, depending on the incomings and outgoings.",
      "At left-back, Luke Shaw is the first-choice when fit and although the season has been a write-off for Tyrell Malacia, he will get another season as deputy to try and prove himself. Diogo Dalot has established himself at right-back, but this could be the summer to sell Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He has a year remaining on his contract and there will be interest from mid-table Premier League clubs.",
      "That leaves at least a couple of spaces to fill for United's new-look recruitment department. Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite is top target and the 21-year-old would be an excellent signing. He is comfortable on either foot and on either side of the defence and looks an ideal long-term partner for Martinez.",
      "I would opt to release Varane and sell Lindelof while keeping Maguire as third-choice. He has enjoyed an outstanding renaissance this season and has plenty to offer off the pitch as well as on it. Depending on the budget available, another young centre-back would be ideal, but with financial fair play still a concern it might not be possible. Evans could get another deal while 19-year-old Willy Kambwala looks ready for more regular first-team involvement.",
      "A new right-back would also be required. United have kept tabs on Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong, who has played as a wing-back this season and has an excellent record for attacking returns. If Wan-Bissaka is sold then a replacement to compete with Dalot is essential and that profile should be another front-footed full-back.",
      "Release: Varane",
      "Sell: Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof",

      "Despite still being in the conversations to win the FA Cup and secure Champions League qualification for next season, a lot of attention is already switching to the summer transfer window at Old Trafford.",
      "Following the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Manchester United will be embarking on a new journey come the summer that is hoped will lead to happier and more successful times. Vowing to knock Manchester City and Liverpool \"off their perch\" within three years, the Ineos chief has grand ambitions to make United great again.",
      "He has wasted little time in trying to make a positive impact, swooping for Omar Berrada, who has been installed as the club's new chief executive, from Manchester City. He also wants to appoint Dan Ashworth as the club's inaugural sporting director.",
      "Though Ratcliffe has suggested off-field appointments will initially take priority over player recruitment, there is no denying that this forthcoming summer's transfer window is a vitally important one in United's history. Big changes need to be made to the landscape of the squad, in terms of both incomings and outgoings, regardless of who the manager is.",
      "With that in mind, here is a rundown of what positions United plan to try and strengthen this summer, who has already been linked with filling them, who could leave and what might actually happen.",
      "United, as reported by the Manchester Evening News at the time, drew up plans for the summer window as far back as September. It is understood they have identified four positions they wish to strengthen as a priority: full-back, centre-back, central-midfield and attack.",
      "There is a general understanding that United specifically want to bolster their right-back options and they have expressed interest in Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong. However, there is an increasing belief they could also be in the market for a left-back after the injury issues they have encountered in that department this term.",
      "As for midfield, it has become increasingly clear they need to source a long-term replacement for Casemiro to fill the defensive-midfield role. He has regressed this season and they need fresh legs in that particular area.",
      "Up front, there is no denying United to source a backup option for Rasmus Hojlund. Anthony Martial is set to leave the club at the end of the season, meaning he needs replacing.",
      "As is always the case with United, they have been linked with players by the lorry load in recent months. A new name crops up almost every single day, but some of them you have to take with a pinch of salt.",
      "Nevertheless, there are some players who are understood to be concrete targets ahead of the summer, including Everton duo Jarrad Branthwaite and Amadou Onana, plus Bayer Leverkusen stars Edmond Tapsoba and Frimpong.",
      "It is understood each member of the aforementioned quartet are being monitored. Branthwaite, who was named in the England squad for the first time last week, has also been linked with several other clubs, including Real Madrid.",
      "Other names to have been regularly linked with United recently include Juventus defender Gleison Bremer, highly-rated Benfica midfielder João Neves and Bologna forward Joshua Zirkzee. Furthermore, a report by the Mirror on Thursday credited United with interest in Wolves midfielder João Gomes.",
      "Just because United have drawn up a list of positions they want to bolster, it doesn't necessarily mean they will tick every box. Outgoings and the money generated from those sales will dictate what they can and cannot do.",
      "In an ideal world, United should prioritise strengthening at centre-back, in defensive-midfield and in central attack. Signing a right-back may not be as high up on the to-do list, such is the way Diogo Dalot has performed in recent months, as first thought.",
      "There could possibly be a dramatic shift in the landscape of the club's centre-back options. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are out-of-contract at the end of the season, while there are no guarantees Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof will not be sold.",
      "If Varane is not handed a new deal, it is highly plausible that United will make signing a right-sided centre-back one of their leading objectives. Lisandro Martinez is arguably the only member of United's current centre-back pool who is a guaranteed starter.",
      "The addition of a second striker also feels highly necessary, likewise a new defensive-midfielder. Sourcing a player to fill the latter of those two positions has to take initial priority, though the acquisition of a new centre-forward cannot be underplayed.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, United are planning to become more proactive in the seller's market, meaning their could be a record number of sales. There are players in the ranks who are highly unlikely to have futures at the club beyond the end of this season, such as Hannibal Mejbri, Donny van de Beek and Facundo Pellistri, all of whom are currently out on loan. Jadon Sancho's future could depend on Erik ten Hag's while Mason Greenwood could be in a state of limbo, though would represent pure FFP profit should he be sold.",
      "Along with Varane, Evans and Martial, Tom Heaton is also out-of-contract this summer, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Lindelof are out-of-contract in June 2025. Lindelof has regularly been linked with an exit in the last couple of years.",
      "Scott McTominay, despite his contributions this season, is a sellable asset, even more so than he was last summer amid his exploits in front of goal so far this term. He could command a fee that could assist with remaining within the boundaries of the Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "Maguire, too, could also be an attractive signing for several Premier League clubs. He has once again been linked with West Ham United. Marcus Rashford, meanwhile, is understood to be of interest to Paris St Germain and Arsenal, and - like Greenwood - would also give United a monster FFP boost if he was sold. Cashing in on the two of the homegrown players could bring in around £120million.",
      "However, Ten Hag revealed last week that United don't want to sell the forward. \"We did not sign him last season for five years with the intention to sell him now,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"He should be part of this project. So it is not a subject we don't talk about.\"",

      "Man Utd need to balance the books to meet the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules and they will have the chance to do that with two deadlines.",
      "The story of Nottingham Forest's 2023 summer transfer window is laid bare in the independent commission's verdict into their breach of the Premier League's financial rules, which was issued on Monday.",
      "It details the interest in Brennan Johnson and the club's attempts to sell him during the window. From a €50million offer from Atletico Madrid, which was contingent on the La Liga side selling another player, to the £47.5million move which eventually took Johnson to Tottenham, it is all in there, including attempts to drum up interest in the forward by offering him to Manchester United.",
      "The reason Johnson forms such a key part of the 52-page written verdict is because of a date in the calendar that has essentially become a second deadline day. June 30, 2023, was D-day for Forest and it was one they missed. That is why they have been deducted four points.",
      "As key figures at Forest pointed out in evidence submitted to the panel, they knew a player trading profit of around £30millon was required by June 30, 2023, the final day of the financial year, to avoid falling foul of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR). They also knew academy product Johnson was the only player who could deliver that.",
      "This verdict should really be the beginning of the end for PSR as it stands. Making the sale of academy players a shortcut to avoid falling foul of the rules and imposing a deadline at a point when the summer transfer window is yet to get going makes them a sham, but right now there is no sign of change coming.",
      "That makes June 30, 2024, another key date for clubs sailing close to the window and that includes United. The end of the 2023/24 financial year is a key one for the club under these rules because it takes into account the previous three years and it is the point at which a £150million loss from 2021/22 will fall off the monitoring period. Until then, things remain tight, with the £33million loss from last season adding to the problems.",
      "United will be allowed to lose £105million across that period and some of the existing losses can be offset against what the Premier League considers 'healthy' expenditure, such as investment in academies, women's football and infrastructure. Even with that included, they are going to face some challenges to meet it, which could make this forthcoming window one of two deadline days.",
      "Clubs are in regular discussions with the Premier League over their exact position and by the time the transfer window opens earlier in June, United will know where they stand. They will know if they need to make a sale and how much they need to bring in.",
      "The issue that Forest discovered is that the market doesn't tend to swing into life until July and that doing a deal earlier in the window often means selling players for a fee below their optimum value. There is also a greater profit to be had by selling academy graduates, who have no book value remaining so any incoming fee is declared as 'pure profit' in the results.",
      "If the situation gets desperate at Old Trafford then United could be forced to look at an early sale for someone like Scott McTominay. The midfielder was on the market a year ago but has proved to be a valuable squad member this term. Any offer of £35million could prove to be incredibly valuable, however, especially if it arrives before the end of June.",
      "That might be a decision United have little option in, with the decision against Forest another example of the Premier League's strict interpretation of the rules. United are also paying the price for the absence of any European football in the second half of the season, which is putting a major dent in their revenues. However, there is an expectation the financial position around the rules will improve once the loss from 2021/22 drops off the three-year monitoring period.",
      "There will remain challenges for Ineos to confront after that. United continue to post record-breaking revenues that aren't producing profits and a failure to reach the Champions League next season will have a major impact on the summer transfer budget, but it might be a case of trying to sell a player or two before June 30 and focus on the incomings from July onwards.",

Despite Mainoo not being included in the first announcement, the midfielder has earned himself a spot in England's first-team squad for upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Belgium, with the United academy graduate now in line for his England debut.",
      "Mainoo played for England from U17 to U19 level, but the youngster skipped the U20s and U21s to earn his call-up to Gareth Southgate's squad.",
      "The first instalment of the EA Sports FC game series EA FC 24 gives every player in the game an overall rating and a potential rating, showing how much room for improvement each player has. Mainoo started EA FC 24 with an overall of just 62 out of 99, but that has quickly improved, with the United star increasing by eight overall ratings since the game's release.",
      "But what's most impressive is Mainoo's potential rating, with EA Sports tipping the youngster to reach an overall rating of 86 out of 99, which would make him one of the best English players in the game.",
      "If the 18-year-old were to reach his potential rating of 86 out of 99, he would be the joint-third highest-rated player in the current England squad, with only Harry Kane (90) and Jude Bellingham (88) rated higher. Mainoo would join Trent Alexander-Arnold, Phil Foden, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka as 86-rated, while he would be better than the likes of James Maddison (85), John Stones (85), and Marcus Rashford (83).",
      "Compared to his United teammates, Mainoo would be the joint-second highest-rated player in Ten Hag's squad, matching Casemiro's rating (86) but just off Bruno Fernandes (88). EA FC 24 is the first EA Sports game that Mainoo has featured in, and the publisher does tend to underestimate the potential rating for a first-timer, just in case its judgment is slightly wrong.",
      "Based on the season Mainoo has had so far, don't be surprised to see his overall and potential rating skyrocket, with the 18-year-old looking like the real deal.",

      "Man United chiefs are believed to be considering changing manager at the end of the season",
      "Gareth Southgate’s future has become a hot topic of discussion during the international break. The England manager has been heavily linked with the Manchester United hotseat.",
      "Southgate, whose contract with the Football Association runs out in December, has been preparing his side for friendlies against Brazil and Belgium as they continue their warm-up for Euro 2024.",
      "Reports this week emerged saying that the 53-year-old had been made Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s No 1 target to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager, should he decide to sack the Dutchman. Ten Hag has come under increasing pressure after a disappointing season at Old Trafford, one that could still be salvaged by winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "LISTEN: Would you like Southgate at United? Our writers discuss",
      "Even that, however, may not be enough to save Ten Hag. The Manchester Evening Newsreported last month that Ratcliffe and Ineos have been analysing managerial candidates should they decide to dispense with him. And while a decision has yet to be made on Ten Hag’s future, Southgate’s name continues to be in the mix, with the former Middlesbrough manager now the favourite with bookmakers.",
      "That news hasn’t gone down particularly well with United diehards, however. While some recognise the job Southgate has done with the England team in bringing about a massive culture shift, uniting different factions and promoting young players - while reaching the final of the last Euros for the first time in the nation's history - others believe he should have done more with a talented England squad, and believe he has a safety-first approach which wouldn’t suit United.",
      "The MEN conducted our own poll into whether fans would be happy if Southgate was appointed as Ten Hag’s successor, and the results were unanimous. Asked if they’d like to see Southgate as the next United manager, a stunning 93% said no.",
      "It sends a clear message to Ratcliffe, and more importantly Sir Dave Brailsford and Dan Ashworth. The latter two are big admirers of Southgate, with Ashworth - a former FA employee himself - valuing the long-term job he’s done with the Three Lions set-up.",
      "The dilemma comes from what is clearly a fanbase that doesn’t feel the same way. If United are to make such a seismic change in the summer, they need to get the appointment right. It has to be someone who has the stature and respect needed at such a huge club, someone who can take on Pep Guardiola and whoever comes in at Liverpool, but also someone who the supporters can get behind.",
      "As things stand, that isn’t Southgate. A strong Euros may change some people’s minds but in the meantime, the message from fans is loud and clear.",

      "Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag has given five young players their debuts, something which Sir Jim Ratcliffe will appreciate.",
      "Youth. Courage. Success. The three pillars of Manchester United.",
      "United have a rich history of believing in young players and Erik ten Hag's promotion of talent at Ajax was one of the reasons his interview at Old Trafford was a success. During Ten Hag's time in charge of United he's given five players - Charlie McNeill, Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore, Willy Kambwala and Omari Forson - their debuts for the first-team.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was handed his bow by Ralf Rangnick, but he's broken into the first-team under Ten Hag's guidance and the Dutchman been the manager responsible for his impressive development, which has seen the winger make 20 starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "Garnacho is an established first-team player and a huge academy success story. He was signed for a pittance from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2020 and he's proved to be a bargain. The 19-year-old has matured this term and his relocation to the right wing, a position which he'd never played before prior to facing Aston Villa, has gone seamlessly.",
      "There was always a suspicion Garnacho would be as effective on the right and he's made that position his own, starting ahead of £86million purchase Antony. Garnacho was the only outfield player not to be given a single minute on the pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia in Ten Hag's first summer in charge but the Dutchman has been the perfect manager for a youngster who perhaps needed more guidance than others.",
      "Ten Hag deserves huge praise for developing Garnacho and he's overseen the emergence of Mainoo, who has started 11 of United's 12 games in all competitions in 2024. Mainoo is an exceptional prospect and the footage of Ten Hag putting his arm around him after the Carabao Cup final at Wembley has resurfaced over the last few weeks.",
      "The 18-year-old was not involved in the squad, but he was invited to take part in the celebrations and Ten Hag's gesture hinted at his future role. He was subsequently named on the pre-season tour of the United States and was the breakout star of last summer.",
      "Mainoo was superb in those pre-season friendlies and his breakthrough into the first-team this season was only delayed by the ankle injury he sustained against Real Madrid in Texas. The midfielder passed every test after returning from injury - facing Everton, Galatasaray, Newcastle and Liverpool away - and his call-up to the England squad is deserved.",
      "It's likely Mainoo would have broken into the United team regardless of the manager, but Ten Hag has shown trust in him and the player has gone on record with his appreciation. Ten Hag has previously said only the best youth prospects will be given meaningful opportunities, and Garnacho and Mainoo are the most recent academy success stories.",
      "United are closing in on the milestone of the 250th academy player to be given their senior debut and that's a remarkable achievement, although unlikely to be met this season. Forson, Kambwala and Gore were the latest players to receive their debuts. Gore has been sent on loan to Port Vale, while the others have been kept around the first-team squad.",
      "McNeill spent the first half of the season on loan at Stevenage, but was recalled in January and he's spending time with the Under-21s to get back up to speed again. Garnacho, Mainoo, Gore and McNeill all started in the FA Youth Cup final in 2022 and it's been tremendous to see them progress to make their senior debuts at the club.",
      "Ten Hag has fulfilled his remit in that regard and that can only bode well for a decision on his future made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has reiterated the importance of developing young players. His record of giving young talent a chance is something INEOS will appreciate.",

      "This week's Man Utd academy notebook on the youth set-up ongoings, brought to you by the Manchester Evening News.",
      "Manchester United's academy continues to thrive, with a raft of players supporting the first-team squad in recent weeks due to injury, while another glut have had loan spells since January.",
      "The next player from the famed academy to appear for the first-team will be the 250th graduate to have done so, a great achievement by the club. Omari Forson - more on him below - was the 249th when he featured against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup in January.",
      "While another graduate, Kobbie Mainoo, continues to hit the headlines with his England call-up, here's a round-up of the news from the youth set-up.",
      "Lacey set to sign new deal",
      "Last year, Shea Lacey signed a scholarship deal at the club, with an agreement in principle to sign professional terms when he turns 17 and his birthday is now just around the corner.",
      "Lacey's first professional contract will be announced after he celebrates his birthday on April 14, and the deal is the reward for his excellent and continued progression in the youth set-up.",
      "The youngster is regarded as one of the most exciting talents in the academy and while he's been limited to just eight appearances this season due to injury, he's close to a return. It's understood that issue is the first injury of note in Lacey's time in the academy and fans who follow the youth set-up have been eagerly awaiting his comeback.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter.",
      "Forson features for the U21s",
      "When Travis Binnion spoke to the MEN for an exclusive interview in December, he suggested Omari Forson could be the next youngster from the academy to be given his debut.",
      "Forson was handed his senior bow a month later and he's since been given a handful of opportunities by Erik ten Hag, who started him against Fulham in the Premier League. The forward is out of contract at the end of the season and although sources indicated he was expected to sign a new deal, talks stalled and he could leave the club this summer.",
      "United want to keep Forson and Ten Hag has expressed that by giving him first-team appearances. He was on the bench against Liverpool last Sunday and a day later, he started for the Under-21s against West Brom as they comfortably won 3-0 in the Premier League 2.",
      "Having a ball",
      "Also in the team for the Baggies victory was Willy Kambwala, another who had been on the bench for that Old Trafford thriller 24 hours earlier. He had clearly got over his celebrations with matchwinner Amad just 24 hours earlier.",
      "Forson and Kambwala, meanwhile, were recently rewarded for their Premier League debuts. They each received a Debut Ball from the Premier League, to mark their recent top-flight bows.",
      "The ritual, which first happened in 2015/16, sees all homegrown debutants who have been developed at an academy of a club in the English football pyramid for three years or more prior to their 21st birthday receive the memento. United’s director of academy Nick Cox and technical director Darren Fletcher presented the items to the pair at the Carrington training ground.",
      "Who will be the next United recipient?",
      "Gore yet to return from injury",
      "Dan Gore was kept around the first-team squad for the first half of the season and he made his senior debut, but due to the competition in midfield, he was sent on loan in January.",
      "Gore signed for Port Vale on loan for the remainder of the season, however, he sustained an injury immediately after signing and he's been unavailable since.",
      "At the start of the month, sources said Gore, who has stayed at Port Vale during his recovery, should be close to a return to action, but he's yet to return from that injury and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad against Burton Albion this weekend.",
      "The U18s' title charge",
      "The words \"Manchester United are top of the league,\" haven't been heard for a while, but the Under-18s have dominated their division this season and are likely to win the title.",
      "They had a flawless record - no defeats - until losing against Manchester City this month, a result which meant City are now 10 points behind, with two games in hand to play.",
      "Adam Lawrence has done an outstanding job in his first season as U18 boss and everybody connected with the club is hoping the league title will be won come May. The U18s are back in action on April 13 against Stoke City.",

      "Mainoo is enjoying his breakthrough season at United, having made 23 appearances for the club this term. The 18-year-old has been handed a regular spot in the first-team squad by manager Erik ten Hag this season, after handing him his senior debut in January last year.",
      "This week saw Mainoo called up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for the first time, as the Three Lions have friendly fixtures against Brazil and Belgium. Mainoo had originally been selected for the Under-21 squad before being added to the senior squad this week.",
      "Mainoo's performances have not come as a surprise to the coaching staff at United's academy. Cox has helped oversee the teenager's development with the youth teams at Carrington, and has explained the talent that the United midfielder possesses that puts him alongside the best in the world - his ability to 'play with a joy and freedom'.",
      "\"Our fans are naturally really supportive of the young players and give them great encouragement, but ultimately, you’ve got to show you’re deserving of being in the team,\" Cox told United's club website. \"The manager is quite vocal about the fact that he doesn’t do favours; you have to earn it and you only get there because you deserve it. For Kobbie to be doing what he’s doing, without work experience or a loan, is amazing.",

      "Jess Park scored a brace in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium",
      "If this is to be viewed as Jess Park's breakthrough season at Manchester City, then it was against Manchester United at the Etihad where she truly came of age.",
      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "Man United Women's boss Marc Skinner has yet to meet the Ineos chief but hopes his arrival could help propel the club to success",
      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“We’re excited about any of the plans that come. It feels like a real positive movement. Whatever the plans may be, we have to continue to align our positive energy towards that movement. That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",
      "However, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to the Chigwell Construction Stadium to take on 10th-place West Ham on Sunday.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a number of issues to resolve at Old Trafford for both the Men's and Women's sides, and Marc Skinner's team must not be left behind",
      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Gareth Southgate is preparing to lead England into the fourth major tournament of his tenure, having reached the quarter-finals, final and semi-final of the previous three; England boss has been linked to Manchester United job with Erik ten Hag's future uncertain",
      "By Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett",
      "Saturday 23 March 2024 06:53, UK",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with replacing Erik ten Hag at Manchester United this summer - but would he be a good fit at Old Trafford?",
      "The England manager dismissed the rumours as \"disrespectful\" in a press conference on Friday, and said he \"wouldn't entertain speaking to anybody else\" before the Euros this summer.",
      "But with speculation increasing this week, Sky Sports News senior reporters Melissa Reddy and Rob Dorsett analyse Southgate's spell with England and whether he could succeed in club football.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy:",
      "When the initial whispers of Gareth Southgate being on a shortlist to become Manchester United manager circled at the start of March, several at the club shot down the links as \"easy to make\" due to Dan Ashworth's impending appointment as sporting director.",
      "The pair worked together through the FA, maintain a strong existing relationship, and shared aligned thoughts on the mechanics behind a successful football operation.",
      "The murmurs have now morphed into ear-splitting noise, with Sir Dave Brailsford, who has also collaborated with Southgate through the INEOS Leaders in Sport programme, reportedly endorsing the England manager.",
      "United have not commented on any of the rumours given Erik ten Hag is still in post, no definitive decision has been taken over his future, and there is still the FA Cup plus securing Champions League football to play for. The club are planning for next season with Ten Hag, including with potential recruitments and for summer tour plans.",
      "There is great annoyance that the high point of their season - the late, galvanising 4-3 victory over Liverpool at an enraptured Old Trafford - has been so quickly followed by such speculation.",
      "Some feel Ten Hag is being undercut and there is certain division in some quarters over the suitability of Southgate for the position.",
      "The greatest concern is how someone who hasn't been involved in the club game for 15 years - he was fired from Middlesbrough after overseeing their relegation from the Premier League in 2008-09 - can walk into its biggest job when he's not even in the conversation for any others.",
      "As one source put it: \"Would any other top club be looking at him this summer? Would Liverpool hire him? Bayern Munich? So why would Manchester United?\"",
      "The reaction to the links from a variety of supporters - fan media, forums, social discussion - has been negative. The local paper carried a piece saying \"Ten Hag's popularity has soared\" and that \"even those who prefer him to part ways with the club would rather he continue than Southgate be appointed.\"",
      "There is a framing, whether rightly or wrongly, of the England manager being too pragmatic, risk-averse and failing to truly maximise the depth of attacking talent at his disposal.",
      "Rewinding through World Cups and the Euros, a cautious approach has tended to be a triumphant one, but that wouldn't wash at United.",
      "There is also scepticism over Southgate given his poor record against the strongest international teams, which was reiterated in the defeat to France at the 2022 World Cup. England have won just seven of their 22 matches (32 per cent) against the current world top 10. How England react when they concede first, the manager's substitutions and a lack of ruthless edge have all been criticised.",
      "Appointing a manager that the fans are apprehensive of, and are not all in on from the start doesn't tend to be a wise choice.",
      "However, Brailsford and Ashworth reportedly believe that Southgate's transformation of the culture, quality, and buy-in around the national team is exactly what United need and that his work can be translated to a day-to-day environment.",
      "There's the benefit at England of fielding players already steeped in the reset having represented the youth teams, although Southgate did heavily contribute to the 'England DNA' directive, the fact that much of the squad come in from environments of excellence - Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal - and that a few camps a year is not the same as a blueprint to be implemented daily.",
      "Southgate's authenticity, empathy and honesty would register well as a representative of the club. He would have supporters in the dressing room from the England contingent. Counterpoints have been made over if he would attract elite foreign players in the market, and if those who don't wear the Three Lions shirt at United would be enthused or underwhelmed by his appointment.",
      "Southgate has received a nod of approval from Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Roy Keane.",
      "United haven't made their decision yet. They have to be conscious of financial parameters and compensation for the England manager would be shy of a lowly £1m.",
      "Southgate, whose contract expires in December, has not made any declaration over his future yet either. A choice will need to be communicated before the end of the season to help the FA, United and any other potential opportunity plan.",
      "While everything is still up in the air, one thing is certain: Southgate to United would not be a universally popular appointment.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:",
      "From the very start, when he took over as manager of the national team in 2016, Southgate's mission was two-fold: to make the nation fall in love with the England team again and to make the players fall in love with the idea of representing their country.",
      "He felt that if he could achieve those two things, along with the obvious quality in the ranks of the playing staff, England would have a real chance of winning a major trophy for the first time since 1966.",
      "His entire ethos has been based around trying to make the England squad, and St George's Park, replicate what it's like for a player in their club environment. His philosophy has worked perfectly. Apart from the trophy bit.",
      "When Southgate took over, the England camp was too often split along club lines. There were, at times, cliques within the squad - those that got on and those that didn't. It wasn't uncommon for players to withdraw from the England squad with minor ailments or simply make an excuse not to be there.",
      "The FA staff have encouraged players to spend time together, at work, at play and at mealtimes. What is obvious now is just how well the vast majority of England players get on. That's why Ben White's request to be omitted from England call-ups going forward stands out as unusual.",
      "The evidence of Southgate's success in this area has been obvious when the summer internationals have come round - usually within days of the Champions League final. In 2019, Tottenham and Liverpool - with nine opposing players included in the England squad - went head to head in Madrid. England's Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands was just five days after the final.",
      "The same thing happened in 2021 when Chelsea and Manchester City met in the final in Istanbul. Seven England players featured in that final four days before England played their first Euros warm-up game against Austria.",
      "Southgate knew those would be incredibly difficult situations, with one set of players elated and the other devastated, with club rivalries exposed for all to see. But on both occasions, those players re-bonded immediately once they met up, united by a shared mission to succeed with England. That is no small achievement from the manager.",
      "A big part of Southgate's plan to make the players motivated to go away with England, rather than go to a beach in Dubai, has been a sense of fun. Enjoyment is at the heart of every camp, with the serious business of preparing for elite-level matches weaved in cleverly.",
      "Remember Harry Maguire and Jesse Lingard messing around on inflatable unicorns in the hotel pool during the World Cup, the day after England had beaten Tunisia. Take a glance at the FA social media pages while the players are in camp to see them playing basketball, competing in a silly quiz or taking on a challenge to roll a ping pong ball into various plastic cups, avoiding an outstretched tape measure.",
      "By and large, the England players enjoy their time away with their country. During Euro 2020, when Conor Coady didn't get a minute on the pitch as England made it to the final he described it as \"the best experience of my life\". He just loved being part of the collective. Even though it cost him four weeks of his summer holiday. Extraordinary.",
      "The FA photos and videos of the players arriving at the National Football Centre are always full of smiling faces, warm greetings, players and friends reunited. New additions to the squad are welcomed in, shown around and integrated quickly.",
      "Overall, it's clear Southgate and his staff have created an incredibly positive, welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere for the England players. They have revolutionised England camps, and the mood among the players, and they've seen a massive jump in success on the pitch as a result.",
      "The question is, could that be replicated at one of the big European clubs like Manchester United?",
      "The same fatherly care for the players - both in public and in private - would be a given if Southgate were the manager at Old Trafford, reminiscent of Sir Alex Ferguson's bond with his players.",
      "The same clever motivational techniques and determination to treat the players with respect would also be easily transferrable and roundly welcomed for sure.",
      "But would Southgate's other techniques work so well?",
      "Some England players have told me that being away with their country sometimes feels like a holiday, a break from the club routine. Would that work so well if those activities were the daily club routine?",
      "There are obvious question marks over Southgate's record as a club manager. When he spoke to Sky Sports in December, he was adamant that his time at Middlesbrough was a much bigger success than he was given credit for.",
      "Southgate has been repeatedly criticised by pundits for his tactical prowess or lack of it. Many will never forgive him for the lack of attacking substitutions during extra time at Wembley in the Euro 2021 final when it seemed Italy's ageing defenders were vulnerable.",
      "So, the jury is out. Southgate has done a quite brilliant job with England, but there are doubts whether he would be able to do the same at a club like Manchester United.",

      "Former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique speaks exclusively to Sky Sports about how the game needs to change to stay relevant; Pique won nine league titles in Spain and England, four Champions League trophies, as well as a World Cup and European Championship",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 07:54, UK",
      "\"It's always good to be back,\" announces Gerard Pique with fondness as he declines the offer of a pause between interviews. \"I love being in the UK as I spent four years growing up here. The weather is always grey but at least it's not raining.\"",
      "Osterley's overcast sky is a far cry from Barcelona. But for a man so decorated from an illustrious playing career, not even a deluge could dampen the spirits of someone fresh from an early flight who has won it all. That his medals totalling over 30 are boxed in an office back home betrays an individual in touch with the present.",
      "As welcoming a guest as he was gracious on the pitch, Pique is a world champion turned visionary hell-bent on creating a version of the game that is more in keeping with the demands of the modern world.",
      "There have been other, less successful, ventures but having hung up his boots following 18 years at the sharp end of the professional game, Pique is confident he has backed another winner.",
      "The Kings League is just over a year on from its launch in Spain, an offbeat seven-a-side game where team owners are content creators expanding to the Americas with Mexico hosting an inaugural World Cup in May.",
      "Where late goals count double in 40-minute matches, draws don't exist and audiences are larger than some LaLiga games, what drove one of the greatest defenders of all time to pursue what has been described as the Twenty20 of football?",
      "\"I felt there was a need to appeal to the next generation,\" Pique explains to Sky Sports. \"There's a lot of young people who are attracted more to entertainment that is short and exciting.",
      "\"It was important to find something where they couldn't lose focus. What is happening with traditional football is that 90 minutes is too long for the new generation.",
      "One manager who has been linked with heading to the Premier League is the Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso.\n\n\n\nPique played with Alonso at international level and says his step into management was an inevitability.\n\n\n\n\"For sure, I could see he had what it took to be a successful manager. He absolutely loves football. He understands how to play the game and it's very similar to Sergio Busquets.\n\n\n\n\"Busquets is still playing but he will be another incredible coach. Xabi has demonstrated at Bayer Leverkusen why he is so highly regarded.\n\n\n\n\"He is having the perfect season in not losing. Let's see next year what he's doing. Everyone says Liverpool will be an option after Klopp leaves, so let's see.\"",
      "\"That's not the case for the semi-finals, the final of the Champions League or the last games of the league but there are too many games and people get lost in all the competitions.",
      "\"We wanted to create a product that is similar to football as there are a lot of people who like football and they also like the Kings League.",
      "\"It's a different product with crazy rules but the key is that I see it as being complementary.\"",
      "Penetrating a Spanish-speaking audience is perhaps unsurprising given Pique's global reach. Three Champions Leagues and nine LaLigas with Barcelona, a World Cup and a European Championship with Spain is being put to good use.",
      "The Kings World Cup which runs from May 28 through to June 8 is expected to build on the capacity crowds witnessed at the Camp Nou and the Wanda Metropolitano last year.",
      "Ronaldinho, Andrea Pirlo, Andriy Shevchenko and Sergio Aguero have all brought extra kudos to this form of chaos, but Pique is keeping his cards close to his chest when pressed on future guest appearances.",
      "\"The presidents love to make big signings - legends of the game have played,\" the 37-year-old outlines with the promise of another stellar cast.",
      "\"For the World Cup, top players are being signed. Next Monday, there's a huge player we'll announce is playing in the competition.",
      "\"He's someone who has played in the Premier League and it's very recent that he retired so I think you'll love the name.\"",
      "The culture of player fandom has exploded since the advent of social media and clubs are acutely aware of how page views and following can swell exponentially if footballing talent is matched by off-field marketability.",
      "For a growing number of football aficionados, satisfying that appetite for a deeper connection with the game's biggest stars feels increasingly inaccessible. Pique feels that disconnect has to be addressed.",
      "\"Clubs nowadays are trying to protect players,\" he admits. \"There's good intention behind it as they don't want them to be exposed. So if you really want to get to know a player... what he likes, his dislikes, his personality, it's very difficult.",
      "\"There are young lads coming through at Barcelona but you don't know much about them because they're overly protected.",
      "\"In our world with the Kings League, what we want to do is the opposite. The players create their own channels on Twitch and YouTube. They talk a lot to their communities, and they want to be famous.",
      "\"This is the big difference from traditional football. In our ecosystem, every day there's a lot of content. On Twitch, you can see a coach talking to a player of another club or a president of another club discussing transfers.",
      "\"Football will forever by the king of the sport and the most followed but it's impossible that this could happen in the game we all know.\"",
      "While football's tradition and what Pique describes as a \"fractured\" ecosystem means altering any rule is met with robust opposition, the Kings League is built around the audience voting for changes themselves on a weekly basis.",
      "Recently, 200,000 streamers voted over a change to the colour of the artificial pitch. Green became black.",
      "\"If there is a rule that doesn't work, we change it the next weekend,\" adds Pique. \"The audience feel the Kings League is owned by them as we give them the power to vote on change.",
      "\"You want offside, or you don't? You want 40-minute or 30-minute games? Now, our grass is black. So, it's real football but in a way it's a video game. There's this mix and this balance that works very well.\"",
      "Some critics have labelled the concept a \"circus\" for TikTokers and YouTubers, and Pique would be inclined to agree.",
      "\"In a way, it's true. We are a mix of sport and entertainment. We want to put on a show. But it is very well balanced because they really care about winning.",
      "\"I see a lot of players and presidents crying when they don't reach the finals. But, at the same time you're having fun. The fact finals are being held at a big stadium tells you the interest is there.",
      "\"The players have never been in front of that many fans so for them not to qualify for the finals is very painful. You can see that they really care about winning and that's very important.\"",
      "While Barcelona find themselves eight points adrift of Real Madrid in LaLiga, their presence in the Champions League quarter-finals offers the promise of something greater.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Erik ten Hag's United, and the man whose departure from Old Trafford in 2008 was described by Sir Alex Ferguson as one of his \"biggest regrets\" believes more trust needs to be instilled in the club's academy products.",
      "Reflecting on his two former clubs, Pique says: \"The difference with Barcelona is that this period of transition at Manchester United has been going on now for quite a long period of time.",
      "\"It's been quite a few years that they've not been able to win the title. I think that after Sir Alex left, they lost a little bit their focus and guidance.",
      "\"They didn't know where to go. Little by little, they are trying to put everything back together in order to compete for titles.",

      "Who is the Premier League's most improved team? And who has had the biggest drop off? We take a look at how each Premier League team compares to where they were at this stage last year...",
      "By Ella-Esrene Frederick",
      "Thursday 21 March 2024 18:19, UK",
      "With the Premier League reaching its final stretch of games,  we take a look at where each team were at this stage last season and how they compare to this year with 10 games remaining.",
      "Arsenal find themselves in the same spot as last season, top of the table after five consecutive wins. However, they are five points worse off with 64 points rather than the 69 they collected at this stage last season.",
      "Last season they had an eight-point cushion on Manchester City (who had a game in hand). This year the advantage on Liverpool is just goal difference, with City a point back.",
      "With more experience after a disappointing ending to last season's title race, the Gunners will be hoping they keep their place on top this time.",
      "Liverpool have made the biggest leap of any team from last season, now looking like the Jurgen Klopp teams of old that have gone head-to-head with Manchester City in title races past.",
      "At this stage last season, Liverpool only had 43 points and were facing an uphill battle in their chase for a top-four finish. This season they find themselves back on top with 64 points and only second on goal difference.",
      "Despite the drop-off last season, Liverpool did finish in good form, winning seven of their last 10 games and narrowly missing out on the top four. They will be hoping for similar form in their remaining 10 games in the quest to give Klopp a dream farewell.",
      "Treble hangover? City are only a point off the 64 they had at this stage last season - and much closer to the summit, being a point off top with league leaders Arsenal coming to the Etihad, live on Sky Sports, next.",
      "To City's advantage this is where they usually find their best form. They won an astonishing nine out of the last 10 in the 22/23 season, while also winning the Champions League and FA Cup. A formidable side who will be confident of landing a fourth Premier League title in a row.",
      "Unai Emery's first full season with Aston Villa could not be going much better. After ending last season in the European places, the progress continues with Villa pushing for a Champions League spot.",
      "They have progressed significantly in terms of points, with four more wins than at this point of last season with nine games remaining.",
      "There's a good feeling around Tottenham with Ange Postecoglou bringing excitement back to the club with his attacking style of play - but they are just four points better off than they were towards the troubled end of Antonio Conte's tenure.",
      "However, improving the points total and challenging for Champions League qualification despite selling star man Harry Kane will be a decent return for Postecoglou in his first season in charge.",
      "Are United going backwards? Erik ten Hag had a good first season at Manchester United, beating Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final and securing a top-four finish. With a slow start to this Premier League season, losing three of their first five Premier League matches, United find themselves six points adrift at this stage, 47 to last year's 53.",
      "With a top-five finish possibly securing a Champions league place, Manchester United remain in touching distance but will have to show their best form if they want to overtake Tottenham and Aston Villa.",
      "The Europa Conference League winners were battling relegation at this stage last season, with just 27 points to their name with nine games to go. But this year they have found a better balance between their Premier League and European commitments. The Europa League quarter-finalists sit in seventh place domestically with a much healthier points total.",
      "Brighton were one of the success stories of last season, displaying excellent football under newly appointed manager Roberto De Zerbi and securing a Europa League place in reward for their efforts.",
      "But after losing their midfield duo of Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool and Moises Caicedo to Chelsea, it was always going to be difficult to replicate. Brighton have struggled to find consistency in this campaign, but only sit four points worse off with 10 games to go.",
      "Gary O'Neil has led Wolves to a really good Premier League campaign so far in his first season at the club, earning impressive wins against the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham, despite having to offload some big names for financial reasons in the summer.",
      "After being dismissed by Bournemouth at the end of last season despite keeping the club from relegation, O'Neil has led Wolves to 41 points so far, sitting in ninth place. It's a huge improvement from the 27 points at this stage of last season when they were in the lower end of the table.",
      "The biggest fallers among the top sides, Newcastle's tally of 40 points is an alarming 13 fewer than they had with 10 to play last season. With European football to contend with this season and injuries to key players such as Nick Pope, captain Kieran Trippier, Callum Wilson and Joelinton, Newcastle have not been able to produce the standards of last season thus far. They sit in 10th and will be hoping for a big finish.",
      "After a turbulent first season under Chelsea's new ownership and multiple managerial changes, Mauricio Pochettino has only managed to edge the Blues up by one point so far this term, gaining 39 points to last season's 38 with 27 games played. With the money spent in the summer and Chelsea sitting in 11th place, Pochettino will be hoping to drive his side up the table with the remaining 11 fixtures - as well as delivering FA Cup success.",
      "Marco Silva's team have had a similar season in terms of points in comparison to last year. Despite losing their top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, they are only slightly down on last year when they had 39 points.",
      "Bournemouth have found improvement, led by a sharp-shooting Dominic Solanke who has 15 goals this campaign. The Cherries find themselves with 35 points and have a top-half place in sight - a big step up on their relegation battle last season.",
      "Crystal Palace have remained largely consistent with 29 points compared to last year's 27 - the managerial changes of Roy Hodgson replacing Patrick Vieira and Oliver Glasner replacing Hodgson steering them away from relegation in both seasons.",
      "Brentford were pushing for the European places this time last season. This season, the aim is to avoid relegation. It's the biggest drop in terms of points from any team, with the absence of the banned Ivan Toney not helping.",
      "Everton are one point worse off than they were at this stage last season - but that includes the six-point deduction they've been handed by the Premier League for financial issues. They remain in the relegation scrap, four points above the drop zone. They were just two points above the bottom three with 10 to play last season.",
      "A four-point deduction for financial issues from the Premier League has dropped Nottingham Forest into the relegation zone, where they are six points worse off than at the same point last year under Steve Cooper, who ultimately led them to safety.",
      "With 10 games to go, last season's relegated sides all had more points than Sheffield United (14 points), Burnley (17 from 29 games) and Luton (22 from 19 games) do right now.",
      "Southampton were on 23 points, with Leicester (25) and Leeds (26) marginally better off.",

      "\"You need to figure out where you put recruitment and strategy, you need to get your organisation right and then populate it with people who are best in class.\"",
      "He added: \"It's not a light switch at Man Utd, it's a much longer road to travel, because there's so many aspects of that club and that game that you need to get right.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and ‘the arrogance of timing’ – former Man Utd coach explains why midfielder now called up by England appears to have so much time on the ball.",
      "Tuesday 19 March 2024 14:47, UK",
      "Speaking to Erik ten Hag about Kobbie Mainoo earlier this season, his verdict was as follows: “He looks very composed,” he told Sky Sports. “He is very mature for his age. What he brings to the team is his composure and his game understanding.”",
      "Composure. Ten Hag reached for variations on that word twice in just three sentences. Watching Mainoo, 18, it makes sense. He appears to have time when others do not, finds space where others do not. But why is that? What is it that he is doing differently?",
      "Every player at the top level of the game should be able to control the ball and pass it in a straight line. Much of Mainoo's work looks that simple. And yet, doing that in the heat of the midfield battle, when the opposition are pressing him, should not be this easy.",
      "Paul McGuinness, the former Manchester United academy coach, has an explanation. \"It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,\" he tells Sky Sports. \"What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes.",
      "\"Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it. All the connections are flowing.",
      "\"There is a lot to it. He has to have the picture beforehand. He has to show for the ball quickly and that means making two or three quick steps. That is what gives him more time. If he just waits for the passes to come to him, he will not have that time.",
      "\"As the ball is coming, he has to be looking again, to be on the half turn to know whether he will be able to turn or not.",
      "\"Because he knows what he wants to do before he gets it, what he does is that he makes sure that the first touch gets the ball into the right place to set up the next pass. It looks like he has time because he does not need two or three touches, he has set it up with one.",
      "\"That saves those milliseconds when people are pressing him.",
      "\"He has prepared the space, lost his marker, already had a look when the ball is coming so that he can take it away from the man. Now, it looks like he has time on the ball. But it is all those little things that have to come together. He is a really clever player.\"",
      "But there is another key difference between Mainoo and many other Premier League players. \"He keeps the ball really close,\" says McGuinness. \"That is deceptive. If you keep the ball close to you then it means that you can play the ball at any time.\"",
      "It goes against some of the received wisdom. \"People say that you should get the ball out from under your feet but if the ball is two or three yards away from your feet then the opponent knows that they can press you because you cannot pass it.\"",
      "Former United academy chief Jim Ryan had a phrase for this. \"He used to call it the arrogance of timing,\" adds McGuinness. \"Kobbie has that. He can wait until that last moment and use the press against them.\" His first senior goal highlighted that.",
      "Mainoo's timing when scoring the 97th-minute winner at Wolves was exquisite in more ways than one. As Max Kilman went to close him down, he nutmegged him. \"When he stuck the ball between the lad's legs, that was a perfect example,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"It looks like he is going to pass it again but he can just turn his foot at the last second and play the ball through the legs.",
      "\"There is that little bit of disguise to it. You are making an illusion that you are going to play the ball forward. To do that, you have to have poise, confidence in your own ability, and the disguise has to look perfect. You are like a magician doing an illusion.\"",
      "As well as his tidy use of the ball, Mainoo is a dribbler. Indeed, he completed six dribbles in the recent win over Luton - the most by a Manchester United player this season or last. That is unusual for a central midfielder but it is a product of his close control.",
      "\"Being able to keep the ball close, it gives you more options. You can play it around the corner and go against the flow, beating them with a change of speed. He does not look an outstandingly quick player, so he is doing it with real efficiency, to change the direction.\"",
      "More often than not, Mainoo does keep it simple. That works in his favour too. \"Because he is doing that a lot of the time, he is difficult to read. It looks like a pass to the wide man but at the last second he can play the ball behind the full-back,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"Ninety per cent of the time, he plays the simple pass, keeps it moving, does the right thing. But because he is doing that, he has then got that element of surprise to his game every now and again when he does try to do something out of the ordinary.\"",
      "When Ten Hag talks of composure and maturity, he is also talking about decision-making. Mainoo looks mature because he does the right things. It was noted how he responded to being caught in possession for a West Ham goal earlier in the season.",
      "\"He has the personality,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"That is what you need if you want to play here.\"",
      "When the game at Luton became frantic, Mainoo was the one who maintained his calm even as more senior players appeared caught up in the frenzied atmosphere. Sometimes the bravest thing in football is not to run around but to put a foot on the ball.",
      "\"The ball carrier is in charge of the game,\" says McGuinness.",
      "\"He looks like that. It is as if he is saying, I am in charge, I will decide.\"",
      "The football style of the future, perhaps? \"It has become a bigger feature because of what the defenders are doing at Brighton. They are baiting them, drawing them on like a matador and then using the space that they have left behind them.\"",
      "Whether Manchester United are going to be at the vanguard, among the better exponents of the possession game, remains to be seen. It looks a long way off right now despite the best efforts of Mainoo. Those patterns are not quite there in their game.",
      "For McGuinness, it brings to mind a comment from Danny Welbeck when the former Manchester United forward was on England duty.",
      "\"I remember him saying when he was in the squad with Marcus Rashford that even though he had not really played with him, they could connect easily because they were looking for the same things. That is why you need stability in a club.",
      "\"Clubs try to buy success but if you do not have a core of players who are on the same wavelength, you are not going to have success. That is why having homegrown players can be really useful because they have grown up together. The timing is right.",
      "\"That was a big feature with the Class of '92. In the last few years, Manchester United have not only been changing players and coaches but changing styles. That makes it really difficult. A player like Kobbie can keep that connection to the United style.\"",
      "The hope is that Kobbie Mainoo will define it over the next decade.",
