      "The former Premier League referee Mike Dean is adamant that Anthony Taylor should have sent off Diogo Dalot during the Manchester derby. The full-back was only shown a yellow card after his studs made contact with Jeremy Doku's knee, which buckled under the impact.",
      "\"At normal speed, to be fair, you can't tell. It just looks like it's a late tackle and he's caught him.",
      "\"But when you see the replays, the replays aren't good; for me, that's a red card. I know they said don't go looking for things, but it's high, it's across the kneecap, it's a red card all day.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The Premier League's official match centre account on X said: \"The referee's call of a yellow card to Dalot for a reckless challenge was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the contact deemed to be glancing and not with excessive force.\"",
      "Gary Neville said on commentary: \"Not good. It is knee high. The ball is there, and Jeremy Doku shifts it. Diogo Dalot is very late. He is clearly looking for the ball, but Doku is too quick for him.\"",
      "Daniel Sturridge, referring to the explanation given for the cautioned not being upgraded, added: \"That's not a glancing blow. That's 'taking a knee in a boxing match', you've got a good punch to the jaw.",
      "\"That to me there, looks like a red. If I'm Doku, I'm staying down. If he stays down longer...\" Roy Keane interjected: \"He helps him, definitely.\"",
      "Sturridge concluded: \"That's a red card.\" On the subject of whether in happening within the first 10 minutes of the match was a factor, Keane said: \"Well, maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean?",
      "\"We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?' Bad tackle, like that?",
      "\"Listen, I've been down this road before: I've given out some heavy tackles and been on the receiving end of a few. To me? I'm no expert on red cards, but...I think it's a red.\"",
      "Alan Shearer also agreed on X. He posted: \"That’s a red all day man. What on earth are they thinking?\""

      "Rio Ferdinand does not agree with Roy Keane's comments on Jonny Evans(Image: PA)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Jonny Evans following Roy Keane's criticism of Manchester United for appointing the former defender as a first‑team coach. This week, Keane questioned Evans' arrival on Michael Carrick's coaching staff, claiming he isn't qualified enough in a brutal rant.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week… If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?”",
      "Keane launched his rant after Gary Neville expressed his satisfaction with Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they’re all brilliant,\" Keane added. \"You said you don’t know anything about Jonny Evans coaching because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man Utd and you're going, 'oh that’s okay because we’ve got Stevie Holland,' A new guru!\"",
      "Since Keane's comments, Ferdinand has argued that Evans deserved his opportunity, insisting the former defender knows the squad well, having played alongside nearly every player - and could help Carrick get the best out of the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"The stuff with the coaches and stuff like that, and calling out the coaches, like, Jonny Evans is a young coach. Why shouldn't he get a chance?,\" Ferdinand said on BBC 5 Live.",
      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club? He knows every single player in that club better than any coach on the planet right now, other than the ones that have been there recently, because he's played there. He knows them all. Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand. If you want to get to know what Kobbie Mainoo is like, because you want to reboot him and put him in a team, I wouldn't mind having somebody that knows him, who's been in the changing room, who knows how he works, closer to me.",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",

      "Jonny Evans during a first team training session at Carrington this week(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "\"I actually understand why someone like Steve Holland's there. He's experienced. Michael Carrick wants an experienced coach alongside him. He's gone for someone like him. Like, what, should he have gone for what?",
      "\"Who else has got experience that he should have gone for? I just, I don't know. It was a... I didn't agree with it, with that, and that's where it starts, and that's fine.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been turning heads during his loan stint at Barcelona but ex-Barca ace Gary Lineker fears the England star might find it tough to reclaim his starting spot from the in-form Raphinha. Rashford, who moved to Barca on a season-long loan from Manchester United with an option for a permanent deal in the summer, only saw 32 minutes of action across two SuperCopa matches in Saudi Arabia as Hansi Flick's side won the trophy.",
      "Rashford was brought on for the last 25 minutes of the semi-final victory over Athletic Club with his team already leading 5-0. Raphinha, starting in Rashford's favoured spot on the left, contributed two goals and an assist before adding another brace in the final triumph over Real Madrid - a game in which Rashford was only handed seven minutes by manager Flick.",
      "The German boss' use of Rashford in recent weeks may well feel like a statement on where he sees Rashford in the hierarchy. There's still a place for the Englishman in the squad but perhaps not in the manager's strongest XI.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford, he didn't come on until quite late on,\" Lineker said on The Rest is Football. \"I did see a thing from the club saying they're very pleased with the way Marcus has settled in. I know he didn't get much of a look in in the Super Cup... [and] he came on just after half-time in the other game in the Super Cup against Athletic.",
      "\"With Raphinha in that sort of form, it's going to be difficult for him to play too much football. But then, as we saw in the first half of the season, Lamine Yamal was injured for a spell, [Robert] Lewandowski was injured for a spell, Raphinha was injured for a spell. They can see that he's doing really well and apparently they want to see if they can negotiate with Manchester United.\"",
      "Fellow presenter Alex Aljoe suggested Rashford wouldn't make it into Barcelona's strongest line-up for the big matches, at least on current form. However, both she and Gary Lineker believe the forward will still have a role to play as manager Flick makes full use of his squad.",
      "\"There's no real drop-off particularly with the players that they've got, particularly in those front positions,\" Lineker said. \"So I think he'll (Rashford) play plenty of football and he seems really happy there.\"",
      "This season, Rashford has contributed seven goals and 11 assists in 28 appearances at a rate of one goal involvement for every 95 minutes on the pitch. His standout performances include a brace in a Champions League victory over Newcastle United and two goals plus an assist as Barca ran riot against 10-man Olympiacos.",
      "Raphinha's recent form has made it tough for Rashford to start matches(Image: Yasser Bakhsh, Getty Images)",
      "After a run of substitute outings around the turn of the year, the England star was included in Flick's starting XI for the Copa del Rey round of 16 match against Racing Santander. The Catalan club secured a 2-0 win thanks to goals from Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal, while rivals Real Madrid suffered a surprise defeat against second-tier Albacete.",
      "Rashford's performances at Barcelona have also caught the attention of England manager Thomas Tuchel. The forward was part of the Three Lions' camp for the September, October and November international breaks, scoring in a 5-0 victory in Serbia and assisting one of Harry Kane's two goals in a 2-0 win away to Albania.",
      "\"He can be one of the best in the world because of the quality I see in training, the finishing with both legs and with the head,\" Tuchel said of Rashford in October. \"He is explosive, he is fast, he is strong in the air, so where are the limits?\".",
      "\"There are no limits - but the numbers don't reach the potential. He needs to push himself into goal involvements, that means goals and assists, it is as easy as that.\"",

      "A former Manchester United star reflected on his transfer saga(Image: Shaun Botterill, Getty Images)",
      "Dimitar Berbatov has revealed how easy he found it to turn down Manchester City in favour of joining Manchester United. The two clubs are set to reignite their rivalry in the Manchester derby this weekend.",
      "Berbatov, 44, became United's record signing in 2008 when he arrived from Tottenham Hotspur in a £30million transfer. Having previously established himself as a prolific goalscorer at Bayer Leverkusen, the Bulgarian scored 46 times in 102 appearances for Spurs.",
      "His knack for finding the net attracted attention from multiple clubs during the transfer window, including City, who had just been bought by Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour. The takeover marked the start of what would become a period of dominance in the blue half of Manchester.",
      "However, at that point, United remained the top power in English football. Sir Alex Ferguson's side were recruiting from a position of strength after securing a Premier League and Champions League double. Berbatov chose to join United, later confessing that the decision was not a difficult one.",
      "\"Look at the shirt: the red, the gold, the badge. The history, the manager, the players, the trophies,\" Berbatov said during his appearance on BT Sport's What I Wore. \"Back in the day, there was no comparison [between Man Utd and Man City].",
      "\"There was no second-guessing or choice to be made. Just one [team]. In my mind, this was the moment to make, maybe, the last step on my mountain... my personal top.\"",
      "The chance to line up alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney proved irresistible for Berbatov when deciding to join United. \"One of the reasons I wanted to be part of this team is because of the players,\" he explained.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to play with players like [Ronaldo, Rooney and Tevez]? You want to be there and be part of that team. You want to test yourself against the best players.",
      "Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney enjoyed a good partnership at Man United (Image: Photo by Ian Walton/Getty Images)",
      "\"It was challenging, it was fun – of course, you need to have fun along the way. And you need to hold your own – if somebody yells at you, yell back. Otherwise, they're going to walk all over you. You need to show how strong you are.",
      "\"The mentality was different because we are talking about a winning team. You fight between each other...scream, yell and curse...but everything is about the win. You stop...the training session or the game, and it stays on the pitch.\"",
      "Dimitar Berbatov poses with the Premier League title in 2009(Image: Photo by John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "During his four-year spell at Old Trafford, Berbatov netted 56 times in 149 appearances, claiming two Premier League titles. Beyond sharing the Golden Boot with former teammate Carlos Tevez in the 2010/11 season, he guided United to Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011, though both ended in defeat against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona.",
      "The Premier League icon will likely be watching the Manchester derby on Saturday as new United caretaker boss Michael Carrick takes charge of his first match. Meanwhile, City will be hoping to close the gap to Arsenal in the title race as well as looking to leave Old Trafford with bragging rights.",

      "Ruben Amorim with Kobbie Mainoo during the 2024/25 Europa League(Image: PA)",
      "Former Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim may have been hesitant to deploy Kobbie Mainoo during his tenure but he never completely dismissed the midfielder's potential. Amorim's tactical system seemingly offered little room for Mainoo, as the boss didn't consider him the ideal partner for Bruno Fernandes in a midfield pairing.",
      "Amorim's spell at Old Trafford was brought to a premature end earlier this month, with his final fixture coming against Leeds United at Elland Road. Mainoo was absent through injury for that match, having also missed the previous three encounters, though he would make a return to the substitutes' bench at Burnley before earning a starting berth in the FA Cup tie against Brighton.",
      "While Amorim remained in the dugout, Mainoo appeared destined for an exit. He's yet to feature from the start in a league fixture this campaign, though he was seeing increased involvement under Amorim before injury intervened.",
      "Despite speculation linking the England international with a transfer that could potentially revive his World Cup ambitions, most reports suggested any departure would be temporary rather than permanent. Furthermore, Amorim's public statements - even while he continued to overlook the 20-year-old - hinted at a conviction that Mainoo still had a future at Old Trafford in some shape or form.",
      "\"I think he's playing in one position, he's fighting with Bruno. They can play together. We need to improve that position and you can see it against Fulham, so I just expect the best from Kobbie, the same as everyone.\"",
      "These remarks followed United's second fixture of the campaign against Fulham, marking the second consecutive match where Mainoo remained on the bench throughout. The youngster would eventually make his first start of the season in the FA Cup clash with Grimsby, but a sustained run in the league side failed to materialise.",
      "Mainoo playing against Brighton in the FA Cup(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Fernandes' remarkable fitness record meant Mainoo's involvement was largely limited to substitute appearances, though a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth suggested Amorim might be prepared to deploy him the following week as cover for the suspended Casemiro. Sadly for the player, injury intervened before that fixture, and he remained unavailable whilst Fernandes himself was forced off injured against Aston Villa.",
      "A January loan switch to Napoli, where Mainoo could have reunited with former United colleagues Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund, had looked the most likely outcome. Now, though, Michael Carrick's appointment as interim boss could provide him with a fresh opportunity - particularly given Carrick's previous statements about the importance of United's youth system.",
      "\"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it... I think Man United's got to have an element of that. It always has done and always should have,\" Carrick said in 2025. \"To have a talent like Mainoo, which he's shown already, you've got to have players like that [in the team], players that you can say, 'They get it. They know it. Let's help them and stick with them'. I think there's definitely a place for him there, for sure.\"",

      "His final playing stint was with Derby County, where he became permanent manager after retiring. After leaving the Rams, Rooney spent just over a year managing DC United in America before returning to England. His spell at Birmingham City proved short-lived, being dismissed in early 2024 before taking his most recent position with Plymouth Argyle, which ended later that year.",

      "Michael Carrick will take charge of his first Manchester United game on Saturday afternoon(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire.)",
      "New Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick has been handed a dilemma over midfielder Casemiro between now and the end of the season, with a reported extension clause in his contract emerging. The 33-year-old is out of contract in the summer, but the deal has an option for another year.",
      "The Daily Mail report that Casemiro’s deal was worth £350,000 per week when he signed for the club in 2023. Failure to qualify for the Champions League has, however, seen his wages drop to under £300,000 per week.",
      "However, it is reported that there is a clause in the player’s contract that could see his deal automatically extended by a year. The further year would see him restored to his original £350,000 a week wage.",
      "It’s said that the clause is triggered if Casemiro starts 35 games in all competitions throughout the 2025/26 season. United’s early exit from both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, as well as their lack of European football this year, means that games are running out for that to happen.",
      "In fact, Casemiro would need to start every Premier League game between now and the end of the season for the threshold to be reached.",
      "The midfielder is expected to be back in the starting XI in this afternoon’s Manchester derby, having been named on the bench against Brighton in the FA Cup last week.",
      "The midfielder has been a regular in United’s starting line-up in the Premier League this season. Of the games he has been available, he’s started all but one, with the one being a 3-0 loss against Man City back in September.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract with Manchester United this summer, but reportedly has an appearance-related extension clause. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Carrick now has a decision to make over Casemiro. The midfielder is expected to leave United at the end of his contract, and letting him leave would save the club £15.6million in wages if they fail to qualify for the Champions League again. If they do make it into Europe's elite club competition, his original wages would be reinstated and cost United a whopping £18.2m next term.",
      "But, to avoid triggering the reported clause in his contract and make an exit much easier, the interim head coach will have to leave him out of the starting line-up for one of the remaining Premier League games. That's something that's not happened since September when the midfielder has been available.",
      "The return to fitness of Kobbie Mainoo could make the situation easier to handle. The academy graduate is desperate for more game time, having fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He has been linked with a move away from the club in the January transfer window amid his lack of game time. But the dismissal of Amorim could change that.",
      "Mainoo will now be looking to impress Carrick and could be given more of a chance by the interim boss between now and the end of the season. The midfielder could potentially take Casemiro's place in the starting line-up, and therefore avoid the clause being triggered.",

United legend Wayne Rooney became embroiled in controversy after the game when it was revealed he was out partying with City players following the hammering and the England icon has now revealed why.",

      "Edin Dzeko got a brace and David Silva scored to see City bag three goals in only four minutes to really rub salt into the wounds of United fans and players.",
      "Speaking about the result itself, Rooney said: \"I think that was a big moment for City back then because you could feel City coming up and getting closer to us.",
      "\"But to come to Old Trafford and win 6-1, I think that was a statement. I remember being on the pitch and it was horrible. It was like in the second half, just felt like it was goal after goal, and you're just like, 'oh, get me off this pitch'.\"",
      "City inflicted the biggest-ever Premier League defeat on their rivals and it was the first time since 1930 that United conceded six goals at their home ground.",

      "Michael Carrick has huge decisions to make before naming his first Manchester United squad(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United Under-21s' line-up for their Premier League 2 match against Fulham on Friday night hinted at potential additions to Michael Carrick's first squad as interim head coach. United face Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday, aiming to put a dent in their city rivals' title hopes.",
      "It is Carrick's debut match at the helm after being appointed as interim head coach until the season's end. United come into the game following two disappointing results after Ruben Amorim's departure. First came a 2-2 stalemate with Burnley in the league. United were then knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "In the last two matches, academy player Shea Lacey was brought on from the bench by Darren Fletcher; however, the forward will miss the City clash after receiving a red card against Brighton. Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher remained unused substitutes at Old Trafford, while Bendito Mantato has also seen first-team action this season, featuring for over 15 minutes in the 1-1 draw against Wolves.",
      "On Friday night, Tom Curtis' side secured a 2-2 draw at Fulham, preserving their three-point lead at the top of the table. Lacey scored twice in the first 22 minutes to give United the lead before Farhaan Al-Wahid netted a brace to equalise.",
      "The squad chosen at Motspur Park was far from full strength, suggesting certain players would be at Old Trafford instead. Jack Fletcher, Tyler Fredricson, Tyrell Malacia - who found the net in the Under-21s' triumph over Wolves earlier this week - and Mantato were all conspicuously absent.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Lacey and Tyler Fletcher featured in the starting line-up alongside Diego Leon. Chido Obi was introduced from the substitutes' bench after 60 minutes, despite having netted twice in the 4-1 thrashing of Wolves.",
      "Whether the quartet who sat out Friday evening's fixture will feature in the United squad for the City encounter remains unclear. Carrick will benefit from having Amad and Bryan Mbeumo available for the first time since their return from the African Cup of Nations.",
      "Amad returned to training along with Bryan Mbeumo following their AFCON absences(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Harry Maguire has also recovered from injury, having made his comeback in the cup loss to Brighton. Matthijs de Ligt remains sidelined, though optimism surrounds his imminent return.",
      "Carrick said: \"Matthijs de Ligt has been carrying a bit of an issue, but hopefully, we'll get him back in some time soon. It's been a little bit slower than they thought previously.",
      "\"All in all, the boys are in good shape. I just feel the energy, whether it's fresh or not!",
      "\"Obviously, I'm delighted to be here. I want to work a certain way, I want to enjoy what we do and work hard to get success. The boys have put the work in this week, and we feel we're ready.\"",

      "Michael Carrick is ready for the challenge(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has returned to Manchester United and will take the reins as head coach for the rest of the season. The former Red Devils captain was announced as Ruben Amorim's interim successor on Tuesday evening and will take on Manchester City in his first game in charge.",
      "The former Middlesbrough manager had been out of a job since his sacking from Boro in June 2024. He led the Championship club to the play-offs in his first season in charge and also guided them to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup in 2023/24.",
      "Carrick described returning to Old Trafford as an \"unbelievable feeling\" as he said: \"It's been part of my life for so long. The fact that I left the club for a number of years recently has never really left me, you know. I'm quickly focused on doing the job.\"",
      "Travis Binnion, a former defender, will serve as one of four assistant coaches. The 39-year-old was previously the main coach for United’s Under-21s and the academy's head of player development and coaching.",
      "It is understood that Binnion will aim to maintain a good bond between the academy and the first-team squad throughout the interim period.",
      "Travis Binnion has made the jump from the youth set-up to the first-team squad(Image: Manchester United/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Prior to Carrick's announcement, the ex-Sheffield United star had already been supporting the senior squad and had assisted Darren Fletcher against Burnley and Brighton.",
      "Jonny Evans was playing for United as recently as last year with 241 appearances under his belt at Old Trafford. The towering defender won three Premier League titles, a Champions League and a slew of domestic cups under various managements, including Ruben Amorim.",
      "Jonny Evans has went from player to coach in just 12 months(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Evans will work alongside former teammate Carrick, who he played with 130 times, in the dugout. This will mark the 38-year-old's first official step into management after retirement from professional football.",
      "Steve Holland is best known for his time as assistant manager to Gareth Southgate for the England national team. He was awarded an MBE for his services to football in 2022 after the Three Lions reached the final of Euro 2020 against Italy, which they lost on penalties.",
      "However, Holland is most remembered for his alleged bust-up with Arsenal defender Ben White at the World Cup in Qatar. The Athletic reported that the pair argued after Southgate's No. 2 accused the centre-half of not taking on board the tactics and training data he was sharing with the team.",
      "Steve Holland is best known for being Gareth Southgate's No. 2 in the England set-up(Image: Alex Pantling - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Holland also brought up that White admitted he wasn't interested in football beyond his own career. In November 2022, he said: \"Sitting down and watching a 90-minute game after I've trained all day and had four or five meetings about football, the last thing I want to do is watch more football.\"",
      "White left the England camp not long into the World Cup and hasn't played for his country since, after turning down the opportunity to be called up again in 2024.",
      "Holland also had spells at Crewe Alexandra, Chelsea and Yokohama F. Marinos.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate worked with Carrick at Boro(Image: Stu Forster/Getty Images)",
      "Jonathan Woodgate worked with Carrick during his time at Middlesbrough, where he began his professional career. Woodgate also managed Boro after a spell as caretaker boss and then moved on to Bournemouth.",
      "During his playing career, the defender played for the likes of Leeds, Newcastle and Tottenham and even spent three years with Real Madrid. However, his debut will be remembered for all the wrong reasons as Woodgate scored an own goal in the first half and was sent off after the break for a second yellow card.",
      "Woodgate's career was ravaged by injury and he made just 14 appearances in Spain before returning to Middlesbrough.",
      "And now the England international will join Carrick in the dugout as one of his first-team coaches.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Frederic Veseli dared to cross the Manchester divide(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Frederic Veseli was just a teenager when he joined an elite group that boasts names like Denis Law and Carlos Tevez. Aged only 19 at the time, Veseli found himself training alongside the likes of Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at Manchester City, but breaking into the first team at the Etihad Stadium proved difficult.",
      "After spending three-and-a-half years without making a senior appearance, Veseli decided it was time to move on. His next club was not only an unexpected choice, but also a very short journey away.",
      "Despite Roberto Mancini's attempts to persuade Veseli to pen fresh terms, the youngster's ambition to further his career saw him join Manchester United, with Sir Alex Ferguson instrumental in convincing the defender to make the switch.",
      "Veseli's former agent Adam Bouskouchi previously said: \"These days, Manchester City are chasing titles and major trophies. It is difficult for them to have faith in youth because they obviously feel experience is the best way for them to get where they want to go.",
      "\"But that attitude didn't help Freddie, who just felt like he wasn't progressing. Freddie spoke with several clubs, here and abroad. But he wants to be a top player in England.",
      "\"When Sir Alex spoke to him, it made such an impression. He is a difficult man to say no to and his track record was enough for Freddie to feel he was making the right choice to join United.\"",
      "Veseli kept turning out for City's reserve team throughout the final 12 months of his deal whilst contract talks rumbled on, with Ferguson making an appearance at one of his matches. \"We could never agree terms,\" the now 33-year-old explained.",
      "Veseli spent three-and-a-half years at Man City (Image: Getty Images)",
      "He's gone on to make 44 caps for Albania(Image: Valerio Pennicino)",
      "\"Mancini would ask me all the time what was happening. I carried on playing. I played against United's reserves who had Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager. United had a lot of first-teamers, we had reserves only and we drew 1-1. Fergie was there watching. I had a really good game.\"",
      "Yet it was prior to the iconic Scot's first involvement that the groundwork for a possible switch to United began taking shape. A chance meeting with then-United assistant Rene Meulensteen at a local pub whilst Veseli was picking up his girlfriend led to discussions about his circumstances at City.",
      "Veseli recalled: \"Mancini was disappointed and was always asking me to renew. I didn't know what to say to him. My contract was up and City released me and signed a paper saying I could leave on a free.",
      "The Albania international left Old Trafford after one season(Image: John Peters)",
      "\"The next day, I drove to City's training ground at Carrington to collect my stuff. I didn't tell anybody what I was going to do next. I told the gaffer that I was leaving the club. He asked me where I was going. I told him: 'United'. He couldn't believe it, but he had to take training. He wished me good luck.\"",
      "Veseli's stint at Old Trafford lasted only a season, and he didn't manage to break into the first team before being let go in the summer of 2013. Following spells at Ipswich Town, Bury, Port Vale and Lugano, he moved to Italian outfit Empoli, where he spent the next four years.",
      "After a whirlwind five years playing for five different clubs, Veseli now plies his trade with Serie B side Sudtirol. Meanwhile, the two Manchester giants are set to clash at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime, with City looking to complete a double over their rivals after a 3-0 victory at the Etihad earlier in the campaign.",

      "Jose Mourinho secured the striker's services for 12 months with the option of a second-year extension to help boost the club's hopes of silverware. During his time with United, Ibrahimovic won the League Cup and Europa League.",
      "He played in the same team as defender Rojo, who had a mutual friend with Ibrahimovic in Ezequiel Lavezzi, which boosted their relationship as a result. Speaking to TyC Sports in 2023, Rojo revealed just how animated the Swede could get in the dressing room with his team-mates, who tended to stay quiet during his rants.",
      "He said: \"He appeared in the group on a Friday, he had trained one day, and we travelled. He started the game and scored an incredible goal.",
      "\"They tied us, and they were hitting us with balls. He came in firing, 'You don't play football like that, this is a big club!' This guy arrived 10 minutes ago, and he's already screaming. [Wayne] Rooney and [Bastian] Schweinsteiger were there... nobody said anything to him. And I was thinking, 'Whoa, this is very spicy.'\"",

      "\"I tell him, 'You stop yelling at me', he told me, 'No, you pass the ball to me, play forward'. He came, and everyone stopped. I stopped too, but I was saying, 'Grab this one', then Mourinho came in furious, he started kicking everything.\"",

      "It's Manchester derby day! Manchester United will be hoping to boost their chances of European qualification this season with a win this afternoon, while Manchester City will look to pile the pressure on Arsenal by taking three points from their trip to Old Trafford.",
      "City are currently six points behind leaders Arsenal after a run of three league games without a win. United are seventh and have failed to capitalise on a favourable run of fixtures, though they are still just three points off Liverpool in fourth.",
      "Here are the starting XIs for today's game:",
      "UNITED: Lammens, Dalot, Maguire, Martinez, Shaw, Casemiro, Mainoo, Amad, Fernandes, Dorgu, Mbeumo",
      "CITY: Donnarumma, Lewis, Khusanov, Alleyne, Ake, Rodri, Silva, Foden, Doku, Semenyo, Haaland",
      "We'll have build-up, updates and reaction throughout the day so stick with us.",
      "That should be that for City, more poor defending and United are in dreamland. Another problem for Guardiola is that he doesn’t have any options to bring off the bench that could really change it. Cherki is already on and the rest are just kids.",
      "From nothing it is 2-0. Dorgu with it! Cunha crosses in and Lewis switches off as Dorgu nips in and the ball clips the post and that's two!",
      "Lewis is booked for pulling back Dorgu.",
      "Casemiro is clutching his mouth after a coming together with Haaland. He should be able to continue.",
      "Cunha ON",
      "Mbeumo OFF",
      "Cherki's free kick is flicked over by Dalot for a corner.",
      "Amad fouls Doku and this is a good position for City.",
      "Amad goes for goal but drags his shot wide.",
      "Rayan Cherki went and got the ball and brought it to the centre-circle before trying to gee his teammates up. It was his free-kick that was countered so well by United but he is still one of the only ones trying to make something happen for City. They have to now, or they can just about say goodbye to their title hopes.",
      "Mbeumo slots in for United! United break quickly from a City free kick, Fernandes plays it through to Mbeumo who finally beats Donnarumma.",
      "Mbeumo the latest to be denied by Donnarumma. Brilliant close range save.",
      "Something happened off the ball in the area then and Fernandes was down briefly but VAR has checked it and nothing doing.",
      "A bit of joy from City in their attack, with Haaland actually getting onto the ball. Cherki looks determined to play a part after coming off the bench but City need to be careful at the other end as they try and open up United.",
      "In the first half City had Nathan Ake at left-back and United could try to exploit his lack of pace to beat the offside trap and get in behind him. For the second half they have Nico O’Reilly, who is much faster but also isn’t a defender by trade so is not as aware as he could be of the offside line. United will keep using the tactic and you can see why.",
      "Amad is denied first by Donnarumma it falls to Casemiro and somehow he saves again and hits the midfielder before going out for a goal kick. Casemiro should have scored.",
      "A quick free kick almost picks out Fernandes but it rolls through to Donnarumma. The flag was up anyway.",
      "Haaland gets his first sight at goal but Martinez slides in to deflect it over for a corner.",
      "Shaw sends a through ball looking for Dorgu, it looked like Khusanov brought him down but the referee says no. That would have been a free kick in a good area.",
      "Neither Foden nor Alleyne looked injured so the subs appear to be a recognition that the idea of the team hadn’t worked and needed to be changed. That said, with the way City have started the second half and with O’Reilly already booked things haven’t got any better yet.",
      "O'Reilly booked for tugging back Amad.",
      "With Alleyne coming off and O'Reilly coming on, the latter has moved to left-back with Ake moving into the centre-back role.",
      "Dalot drills a ball across goal but Mbeumo, Dorgu and Fernandes can't reach it.",
      "The second half is underway at Old Trafford with United kicking off towards the Stretford End.",
      "Cherki, O'Reilly ON",
      "Foden, Alleyne OFF",
      "At the end of the half, Haaland needed treatment and he limped off the pitch after being stood on, it seems. One to keep an eye on.",
      "It feels like one of those games where City will come out and look significantly different in the second half. Guardiola hasn't been able to get his team into the game and nullify how United have been pressuring them, but there have been a lot of games this season that have looked like this and then Guardiola or Lijnders has done something at half-time to help. It's been a messy first half though and United are certainly going in with the momentum.",

      "Michael Carrick will take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager this weekend(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick wasn't your typical English holding midfielder. A classy, controlling passer, for a while he was considered England's answer to Pep Guardiola. Nine years ago, Guardiola himself called Carrick \"one of the best holding midfielders I've ever seen in my life\".",
      "How far do the comparisons go? If Carrick was the English answer to Guardiola in midfield, could he also be the English answer to Guardiola in the dugout? It's not exactly a perfect comparison, admittedly. The current Manchester City manager never had a three-season spell in the Spanish second tier that ended with shrugs of shoulders all round.",
      "But there has often been a sense around Carrick that he has the talent to make a success of a managerial career, never more so than the early months at the Riverside when he supercharged a play-off push after inheriting a team shaping up for a relegation battle. Coming on the back of a three-game spell as a caretaker at Old Trafford that produced wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw with Chelsea, it hinted at promise.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The momentum has stalled since then, and it looked like Carrick was considering whether he wanted to continue pursuing a career in management, but when the club that shaped his career came calling last week, he couldn't say no.",
      "On Saturday lunchtime, he will walk out of the Old Trafford dugout and take charge of his third Premier League game as a manager. Next to him will be Guardiola, his stylistic equal as a player but a coach who has now amassed more than 1,000 games as a boss, almost all of it at the very elite level",
      "The contrast in experience is stark, and although Carrick, 44, ticked the box as a former United great, his CV and lack of experience weren't necessarily deserving of a 17-game spell in charge at Old Trafford, but he insists he feels ready for the challenge ahead.",
      "\"I've never really thought about it like that,\" he said. \"I just feel comfortable, I feel at home. Not comfortable in the fact that it's nice and everything's great, it's comfortable in the fact that I'm happy in my skin, happy in this role.",
      "\"I know what it takes, I worked closely with Jose [Mourinho] and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] for some time, so when I took over it felt quite a natural step. I understand the questions and that's how it is, you always question until you've achieved something. All I can say is I feel at home, I feel I'm ready and I'm really looking forward to getting to work.\"",
      "Carrick has taken over a squad visibly lacking in confidence and a team sitting seventh in the Premier League, with just one win in seven from a forgiving schedule. He stressed his arrival would act as a \"fresh start\", but games against City and Arsenal in his first two fixtures are a daunting beginning. Despite that, he believes the culture around the training ground and the attitude of the players has encouraged him this week.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days, and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything,\" he said. \"The players have been really good, willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put in better performances.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day to day, it's not something I sit here and talk about and a few words here and there and it makes it sound good, it's how you behave and what you end up doing day to day.",
      "\"That's something we've got to build, but certainly at the moment I feel it's a good place and the training ground has been a really good place and we need to make Old Trafford tomorrow an even better place with the help of the supporters as well and that's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",

      "The Portuguese defender was initially booked for catching Doku on the knee with a high boot before VAR reviewed the incident. However, referee Anthony Taylor's on‑field decision stood, as officials felt there was not enough intent to upgrade it to a red card.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre, which clarified the incident, deemed the challenge neither forceful nor intense.",
      "A tweet on X read: \"The referee's call of yellow card to Dalot for a reckless challenge was checked and confirmed by VAR - with the contact deemed to be glancing and not with excessive force.\"",

      "“Looking at the group of players they have, it is going to be a big ask. You look at Michael Carrick, his remit at Middlesbrough was to get promoted, he didn’t do that, so you could say he failed there.",

It is great for him, but I look at the staff he has brought in and we sit here every week and talk about Man United being the best of the best and at this moment in time I don’t see that, even with the appointment and the staff, but that doesn't mean to say they can’t get results.",

      "Moving on to Evans, Keane said: “I like Jonny Evans. He’s rock solid and I have signed him twice. It isn’t an issue with Jonny Evans; it is more an issue with the club and the decision-making of who they are bringing in.",

      "Good morning and welcome to our Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "It's been a busy week at Old Trafford with Michael Carrick appointed as their interim head coach on a deal until the end of the season and all eyes are now on the club's owners to see if they can bolster his squad before the January transfer window closes.",
      "United have not yet added to their squad this month, with Ruben Amorim's departure putting any transfer activity on the back burner.",
      "However, that hasn't stopped speculation from around the globe with United linked with a number of incoming and outgoing transfers.",
      "United are understood to be among a number of clubs that could sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from AC Milan. According to TeamTalk, United have been 'offered' the ex-Chelsea midfielder by the Italian side.",
      "Milan are believed to be willing to sanction a loan deal with an obligation to purchase permanently in the summer. Additional clubs who are also interested reportedly include Newcastle, Sunderland, Fulham, Aston Villa, Everton and Brentford.",
      "The 29-year-old departed from the Blues in 2023 after an eight-year stint, making a permanent move to Italy following loan spells at Palace and Fulham. Throughout his career, the midfielder has scored 30 goals and provided 32 assists in 367 appearances.",
      "Marc Guehi and Oliver Glasner, who could join United in the summer, are already leaving the Eagles.",
      "Napoli boss Antonio Conte has digged at ex-Man United head coach Ruben Amorim after Rasmus Hojlund was shipped out of the club to join the Italian giants.",
      "\"Certain young arrogant head coaches these days don’t want to adapt , they see a young striker (Hojlund) struggling instead of coaching him they blame him , always moan and blame everyone but themselves because they are spoon fed.\"",
      "In case you missed it yesterday, Manchester United have decided to recall goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at Shrewsbury Town.",
      "Harrison started for the League Two outfit against Wolves in the FA Cup last Saturday, but his minutes in the league were limited after Will Brook took his place between the sticks.",
      "A club statement confirming the decision read: \"Manchester United have recalled young goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at League Two club Shrewsbury Town.",
      "\"The 19-year-old spent the first half of the season with the Shrews, managed by United Academy graduate Michael Appleton, after joining the club in July.",
      "\"He made his Football League debut against Colchester United and also gained senior minutes in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Vertu Trophy.\"",
      "Not sure I see any merit in this, to be honest. Dalot is 26, there is no point sending him on loan to develop and he is the first-choice right-back and a member of the leadership group.",
      "He's had a difficult season and the criticism of him from supporters has been noticeably louder this year. I'm not sure he's the long-term answer at right-back but there is no replacement ready to go either. Even if Noussair Mazraoui takes that place next week, Dalot would be needed as back-up.",
      "There is probably an argument to sign a right-back in the summer, although midfield has to be the priority. It feels inevitable that Dalot will face more competition at some point.",
      "Oliver Glasner's decision to leave Crystal Palace has led to a big move in the markets for him to become the Man United manager for the first game of the 2025/26 season. Glasner has been backed from 6/1 into 3/1 after he confirmed he will be leaving Palace at the end of the current season.",

      "\"I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in the October international break, a dinner, a very long talk and I told him I would not sign a new contract.",

      "Wayne Rooney has urged Michael Carrick and Manchester United to swoop in for any players they have on their radar should they become available this month, via the most-recent instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "The problem United have got at the minute is if players become available now, I think we have to go for them.",
      "Because when it comes to the summer and you're in competition again with the teams who are more successful at the minute, it becomes more difficult to sign the players they want. If the players become available now who you think, 'Yeah,' we can go for him now.",
      "And maybe you're paying over the odds to get him a little bit. I think they have to take it now.",
      "Manchester City could have signed a new player in the January transfer window ahead of the Premier League clash against Manchester United.",

Keane recently expressed doubts about Evans' qualifications for the role on Michael Carrick's coaching staff during a scathing tirade.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane remarked on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week... If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.",
      "\"What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?\"",
      "Keane's outburst came after Gary Neville voiced his approval of Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they're all brilliant,\" Keane continued.",

      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club?

Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand.",
      "Jonny Evans has been appointed as Michael Carrick's first team coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",

It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation — and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's comments on backroom teams come days after the announcement that his former England assistant manager, Steve Holland, will support Michael Carrick at United until the end of the season. The former Chelsea assistant is part of the coaching team alongside Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post continues: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has been tentatively linked with the Man United manager's job(Image: Burak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously criticised the Glazers for their management of Manchester United, leading to speculation that the esteemed manager could be a potential candidate to succeed Ruben Amorim in the summer. The Old Trafford hierarchy chose to part ways with Amorim following an outburst that appeared to question his position within the club.",
      "Amorim was the first full-time appointment made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their joint ownership of United.",
      "With no immediate successor for Amorim in sight, they have appointed Michael Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season..",
      "Consequently, the list of possible candidates for the summer is expanding, including international managers such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann who may be available, reports the Mirror.",
      "There's also Ancelotti, currently managing the Brazil national team, whom former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes should be considered by the club.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" Meulensteen said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It remains uncertain whether Ancelotti would consider a switch to Old Trafford, or if the club's decision-makers are even considering the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss. Nevertheless, when it comes to alignment, questions may arise regarding the Glazers' involvement.",
      "Whilst the partial sale saw Ineos and Ratcliffe acquire a minority share of the club, alongside control of footballing matters, the Glazer family retain majority ownership. This could potentially create tension, particularly given Ancelotti's candid remarks about the family back in 2016.",
      "\"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers,\" Ancelotti said.",
      "\"That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "Whether Ancelotti genuinely features on United's shortlist for a new head coach remains uncertain, but speculation will persist about the club's requirements moving forwards. The notion of 'Man United DNA' has become a recurring talking point in debates over the next managerial appointment.",

      "Michael Carrick takes charge of his first United training session(Image: )",
      "It's rarely quiet at Old Trafford but the first two weeks of 2026 have been explosive even for the standards of Manchester United. Michael Carrick is the club's third head coach of the year already.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dramatic end and Darren Fletcher's caretaker spell have led to the appointment of Carrick until the end of the season and the challenge that now awaits is to steer the club back into European competition.",
      "That won't be easy and the start is a daunting one, but there is now a sense of calm at Carrington once more. This is the story of a remarkable two weeks and how United got to the point where 44-year-old Carrick was summoned from a beach in Barbados to take charge of the first-team.",
      "There was frustration bubbling away at Carrington on the second day of 2026, but no sense of the explosion that was about to go off at the club's training ground.",
      "The failure to beat Wolves a few days earlier had stuck in the craw of key executives, particularly given Amorim had gone back to his favoured back three formation. Wolves boss Rob Edwards revealed post-match he had always expected Amorim to do just that, while the United head coach said he had wanted to match up the visitors.",
      "That negative approach set alarm bells ringing again. Amorim had gone to a back four and a more attacking ethos against Bournemouth and Newcastle, but reverted to type for a game against a team that, at that point, were still to win in the Premier League.",
      "When director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to Amorim about it at a pre-planned meeting on the morning of Friday, January 2, the head coach \"blew up\". He hinted at the unhappiness in his press conference ahead of the game and then cancelled a planned broadcast interview.",
      "The Amorim era came to a dramatic end at Leeds(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Two days later, he used the final question of his post-match press conference to essentially air his grievances with Wilcox in public. If it was a power play, it was never going to succeed.",
      "Amorim pulled into Carrington the next morning well aware he was about to be put out of his misery. His dismissal was about results, but it was also about his behaviour, not just in that showdown with Wilcox, but in the public criticisms he had aired against some players as well.",
      "There is a feeling that Amorim never quite 'got' United. He never understood the club's values or bought into the tradition of the type of football they should play. He certainly didn't sound like a United manager at times.",
      "It has been suggested that the 40-year-old was taken aback by the sheer scale of the task at hand and the noise that reverberates around the club. He called out people paying too much attention to pundits in his final press conference, but he has never had to deal with a struggling super club before and the spotlight will always be harsh.",
      "It's something Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag had to come to terms with as well, so with only 17 games left to salvage something from this season, United couldn't afford to appoint someone who needed time to get their feet under the table. That is why Wilcox looked to the days of United's past.",
      "Jonny Evans oversees United training on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "There was some schadenfreude at a shortlist of Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the nostalgia was deliberate. All three understand the club and are used to the noise. There will be no adaptation period required.",
      "In what became a straight shootout between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former's knowledge of a group of players who are yet to click together this season impressed Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. He is also a progressive appointment whose best days as a coach might be ahead of him, whereas it feels like Solskjaer's best days in management are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox also felt Carrick could work in a collaborative structure that Ineos are putting together at Old Trafford. He is a hands-on coach, whereas Solskjaer's experience at United is more managerial, although that is partly due to the absence of a clear structure when he was in charge between December 2018 and November 2021.",
      "Carrick's coaching pedigree helped him win the race and it didn't harm his cause that he had made an impact with some of these players as well. His three-game stint as a caretaker in 2021 is remembered fondly, but he also led much of the training when Solskjaer was in charge, along with Kieran McKenna.",
      "He is still a popular figure with some members of that squad who remain at Old Trafford and his ability to quickly assemble a coaching staff has gone down well. In particular, the appointment of experienced No. 2 Steve Holland is considered a wise move.",
      "For a while under Ineos, it felt like the sight of Holland pulling into Carrington was inevitable, alongside former England boss Sir Gareth Southgate. However, interest in Southgate has waned, and Holland's appointment isn't directly related.",
      "Instead, the search is now underway for a permanent head coach, although there is intrigue surrounding the removal of the word 'interim' or 'caretaker' from Carrick's job title. His job is simply that of head coach, albeit on a contract that runs until the end of the 2025/26 season. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2018 season, and Rangnick was the interim manager in November 2021.",
      "United stresses that those decisions were made under a different regime, and the decision not to use the words 'interim' or 'caretaker' is due to the length of time he will be in charge. The process to appoint a permanent head coach will be a thorough one, but Carrick will inevitably be in the picture. The results will dictate the strength of his case.",
      "Carrick, Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were in place at Carrington on Wednesday morning to welcome the players. There were \"good vibes\" around the place, as one source put it.",
      "Plenty of the squad already know Carrick and some know Holland as well. Carrick's career means he commands respect from the squad. He held a relatively brief introductory team meeting on Wednesday morning before a first training session on the grass which was watched by Wilcox.",
      "Gym work followed for many of the squad, but there were no significant changes implemented by Carrick on day one. Although club media filmed some of the session, there was a desire not to reveal too much.",
      "There will be two more sessions before City arrive on Saturday and the Carrick era truly begins.",

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the asking price of French club OGC Nice, in a continued bid to end his stake in the team.",
      "That's according to Bloomberg, which states that Ineos had been seeking over €200m (£173m) to complete a full sale of the club in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Ratcliffe had put Nice up for sale last year, but there are claims that investors were not willing to pay the asking price for the Ligue 1 outfit, so the price has \"come down significantly\" to aid in offloading them.",

      "DAZN had originally taken on the rights, but after a deal collapsed, Ligue 1 have been managing and distributing their own broadcast deal among clubs.",
      "Any deal for an investor to buy the Ineos stake in Nice would end nearly seven years of the company at the head of the French club, which has come with mixed results.",
      "So far, Les Aiglons sit 14th in the league with just a six-point buffer to the relegation places, while they are yet to register a single point in the Europa League, with criticism coming in for the management of the club in recent years.",
      "It comes at a time when Manchester United face their own challenges and turbulence under the part-ownership of Ineos and Ratcliffe.",
      "There have been signs of improvement, following last season's dismal showing in the Premier League when they finished 15th, but chaos has ensued following the decision to sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese coach was the first full-time head coach hired under the new ownership and sporting structure, which has seen Ratcliffe's group attempt to transform the way they operate behind the scenes.",
      "This clearly caused tension for Amorim, who outlined the fact that he wanted to be a manager and not a head coach at the club, despite the new structure featuring a director of football in Jason Wilcox.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said in early January when asked about his optimism with the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "His exit, along with the hiring of Michael Carrick as caretaker manager, outlined the need for Ineos to get the next hire right to help push Man United in the right direction again, while there has been some scrutiny over the situation with the departing head coach.",
      "That change in direction will have to coincide with a clear game model implemented from the sporting department, along with the right types of players signed by the recruitment department to play specific roles.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "Man Utd then announced Michael Carrick as the interim manager until the end of the season earlier this week with the former midfielder’s first match against Man City in the early kick-off on Saturday.",
      "Keane, clearly unhappy at the way Man Utd are currently being run, hit out at the club’s hierarchy and called it “a bit of a circus act at the moment”.",
      "“It just seems a bit of a circus act at the moment. But if they start well and get momentum I still think there’s a great chance for the team to get in the Champions League, which has got to be the aim.”",

      "“I wouldn’t want to work with people above me who are dictating who your staff are, telling you what players to bring in.",
      "“There’s chaos going on in the background. I’m not saying the previous manager hasn’t helped himself but I guarantee he’d come out one day and say there were decisions made that he wasn’t happy with.",
      "“Most managers go down that road and I get it, he was stubborn and his results weren’t great. There’s no reason why these four new staff members, as much as I’m concerned about them, can’t get some momentum going, they can do.”",
      "Jonny Evans came back to help Fletcher as caretaker manager just 30 days after departing Man Utd as loans manager, something which doesn’t sit right with Keane.",
      "Keane continued: “Jonny Evans rocks up, they’ve signed him twice. It’s not an issue with Jonny Evans, it’s an issue with the club and the decision-making, who they’re bringing in.",

      "“Although it is significant to point out that whilst it wasn’t the crucial factor that led to the sacking of Ruben Amorim a week ago, there was a difference of opinion between Amorim and his bosses here, Jason Wilcox, the director of football, in particular, about whether they should strengthen in January because they are just outside the Champions League places.",
      "“Amorim was keen on getting more attacking options – he likes Jean Philippe-Mateta, he likes Danny Welbeck at Brighton as well.",
      "“But United were never going to sanction any more attacking moves, any more attacking players being brought in when they spent almost £200 million on three attacking players on three attacking players in the summer, and also because Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are expected to return this week.",
      "“With all that in mind, no, Manchester United are not planning to spend big in January, no, Carrick hasn’t asked for any reinforcements. That’s not to say they won’t do any business at all. It’s been made clear to me if there is a long-term target who United have had, who becomes available in January at the right price, they will make a move for him, but certainly the changing of the head coach will make no difference to the chase of new transfers.”",

      "Let’s be honest, the January window has become really boring as most of the transfer excitement is reserved for the summer.",
      "This is partially thanks to Profit and Sustainability rules dissuading clubs from making panic buys, while it is also the case that the best players on the market are available in the summer, not the winter.",
      "We are now past the halfway point of this window, and there has only been one transfer worth more than £50m, which is not good enough if you ask us.",
      "The race to sign Antoine Semenyo was fun while it lasted, while the Conor Gallagher saga has been one of the very few deals to provide some thrill this month.",
      "In Gallagher’s case, this is because Tottenham Hotspur pulled one off one of those incredibly fun transfer hijacks, having been forced into a £34m deal to beat Aston Villa to the signing. More of this goodness is required if this transfer window is to be saved.",
      "So, here are six more players who could follow Gallagher in being at the heart of a forced hijack transfer in the coming weeks, with Liverpool and Manchester United potentially dragged from their slumber to do some business…",
      "",
      "Teenager Diomande falls into the bracket of a player who is far more likely to secure a move in the summer than this month, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that Spurs have already tried and failed to sign the winger in this window.",
      "The teenager has eight goal involvements in 15 Bundesliga games this term, so it is no wonder that he is being earmarked by current club RB Leipzig and several Premier League sides for a big-money transfer in the near future.",
      "Leipzig are rightly opting to hold out until the summer, by which point there will be more competition and likely a higher valuation for Diomande. But plans could always be brought forward if a club makes a silly and irrefusable offer, which Spurs have already proven with Gallagher that they are willing to do.",
      "Diomande will likely have clubs higher up the food chain looking at him in the summer, with Liverpool among the sides who should bring their plans forward if their hands were forced with a sizable Spurs bid.",
      "Were this to happen, Diomande would obviously choose to join Liverpool over Spurs to bolster their winger department, which suddenly looks rather weak following the exit of Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah’s decline.",

      "One certainty in the transfer market this year is that Man Utd will revamp their midfield as part of a long-overdue overhaul.",
      "United’s focus on signing attackers and Bruno Fernandes’ failed transfer meant INEOS had to push back their midfield plans, with £100m-rated Carlos Baleba among those put on the back burner.",
      "All reports indicate Baleba remains an option for Man Utd, along with Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson, but they need more than only one of these Premier League standouts if they are to fix their midfield.",
      "Man Utd’s next marquee signing is likely to be one of those three, but this future deal could be supported by one or two affordable signings to cover the potential losses of Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and/or Fernandes.",
      "Gomes, who is reportedly valued at £43m, is certainly a more realistic target for Man Utd this month than those aforementioned midfielders, but Atletico Madrid are currently working on a deal as Wolves seemingly look to cut their losses before his value drops further following relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old will become much cheaper in the summer, but Atletico’s interest could complicate matters and force Man Utd to show their transfer muscle to win a transfer race, which they continue to do despite their woes on the pitch.",

      "Guehi’s proposed move to Man City is likely too far along for Liverpool to pull off a hijack at this stage, but this is what we want to happen, not what we think will happen…",
      "Liverpool’s collapsed deal for Guehi in the summer was all their doing as they wasted far too much time before striking a £35m agreement with Crystal Palace, who had no choice but to pull the plug on deadline day over their inability to source a suitable replacement.",
      "By all accounts, Guehi had one foot in Liverpool in the summer and they have remained a frontrunner for his services in recent months, but their failed deal in the summer opened the door for them to miss out completely if another club decided to make a serious move for his services, and this is what is currently playing out…",
      "Injuries to Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol gave Man City the impetus to step up their interest in Guehi and they have been rewarded for their proactiveness.",
      "The arrivals of Guehi and Semenyo provide a significant shot in the arm for Man City’s title challenge, while Liverpool have been punished for standing still, as they will miss out on their top centre-back target unless there is a rather dramatic hijack at the eleventh-hour…",

      "The former Wolves standout is among the considerable examples of players to head to the Saudi Pro League when he still had plenty to offer at the top level in Europe, and this remains the case as he is still only 28.",
      "Neves’ situation makes him a no-brainer signing for most Premier League clubs, including interested sides Man Utd and Newcastle United, and it feels increasingly likely that he will end up back in England at some point this year.",
      "A free transfer would be most beneficial to Neves personally, but a deal could always be brought forward if a club is the first out of the traps in this window.",

      "Still, the player often wins in this scenario and West Ham will likely swerve the headache of keeping him if their valuation is matched, with this offer most likely to come from a Premier League club.",
      "Paqueta has his heart set on a move to Flamengo, but he may have to make adjustments if he’s to leave West Ham this month and a switch to Aston Villa, after Fabrizio Romano cost them in the summer, could still be an answer.",

      "We were all very wrong about Brentford this season and this is largely thanks to Thiago filling the void left by Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa, scoring 16 goals in 21 games as the second-best striker in the Premier League this term.",
      "Unfortunately for Brentford, Thiago’s goalscoring exploits mean the London side will be expecting to lose their prolific striker this year.",
      "The most tempting offers for his services are likely to come in the summer, but Spurs could spoil Aston Villa’s plans with another hijack if each club goes for Thiago this month.",
      "Spurs have been toothless in attack in most matches this season, while Villa need to strengthen after offloading Donyell Malen to AS Roma. Therefore, a swoop for Thiago is not completely out of the question and Brentford could benefit from their respective desperation when negotiating a price.",

      "",
      "As first impressions go, Andrews’ was a shocker. In his first game as a head coach, Brentford were 3-0 down at half-time on the opening weekend of the season after Forest ran all over them, prompting much smugness amongst those of us who pinned Andrews’ side as relegation fodder.",
      "There’s a chance we may have been wrong.",
      "",
      "Few could hold defeat in his opening game against Edwards, so poor were the team he took over. Second-half goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino took Palace fourth and left Wolves bottom and winless in 12. It took eight more games for Edwards to taste victory when Wolves met the only side as f***ed as they are.",
      "",
      "No new returning manager bounce for Everton – not immediately – with Moyes seeing his side sunk by Ollie Watkins five days after he replaced Sean Dyche. After one win in 12, sat in 16th place, it was a sobering illustration of the task at hand.",
      "But Moyes then turned Everton around, winning four of their next five and avoiding defeat in their next nine.",
      "",
      "“I am not happy we have not won the game but happy overall. In terms of attitude, desire and commitment it was better than I expected,” said Arteta after his first match as a head coach in any capacity, when he could not give away shares of trust in his process.",
      "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised after Dan Gosling’s opener to give Arteta a point against Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. That sentence makes no sense in big 2026. Thierry Henry was not impressed.",
      "",
      "On humble beginnings this Fulham revolution has been built. The Cottagers had been relegated but managed to improve on their managerial situation, with Scott Parker leaving by mutual consent en route to Bournemouth as Silva took up his first post since leaving Everton about 18 months before.",
      "It was an undoubted coup, just not one made immediately obvious by a draw with Neil Warnock’s Middlesbrough. Harry Wilson scored a delightful goal from outside the area because obviously.",
      "",
      "Farke’s first Leeds side on the opening day of the Championship season in 2023/24 featured only three players who played in the last Premier League game in May.",

      "",
      "After a summer of bleating about how harshly Gary O’Neil had been treated by nasty Bournemouth, the time had come for the Cherries to show their working out. A draw with West Ham was respectable enough without coming close to confounding the critics.",
      "Solanke equalised after Jarrod Bowen’s opener, meaning that West Ham had conceded decisive goals scored by summer transfer targets in the first game of consecutive Premier League seasons. Which feels particularly on brand.",
      "",
      "Nuno replaced Graham Potter on the Saturday before a creditable draw at Everton on the Monday. The new manager made a point of acknoeldging the away support: “It’s our priority to become closer with our fans and bridge the gap, and to deliver so they appreciate the work of the team.”",
      "It’s not going well.",
      "",
      "Taking charge of the Europa League winners, Frank’s first official game in charge was the UEFA Super Cup final against Champions League winners PSG. And it was all going swimmingly when Spurs led 2-0  – Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero on target – with five minutes of normal time remaining.",
      "But, Spurs. Nine minutes later, they had been pegged back before they fluffed a penalty shoot-out.",
      "",
      "A victory, but for once that wasn’t really all that mattered. After months of forewarning that Our League would not simply bend to his will and Guardiola would be found out against the sort of proper competition neither La Liga nor the Bundesliga could provide, this was a thoroughly underwhelming start.",
      "The hosts needed an 87th-minute Paddy McNair own goal after an early Sergio Aguero penalty to prevail against a Sunderland side which would be relegated come what May, with the unceremonious axing of Joe Hart from the starting line-up a major point of early contention.",
      "",
      "Le Bris was appointed in the summer of 2024 and whatever scepticism there may have been of the Frenchman on Wearside soon dissipated when an away win at Cardiff, thanks to goals from Luke O’Nien and Jack Clarke, formed the first of four successive wins to kick off the Championship season.",
      "Le Bris’ team featured only two names – Trai Hume and Eliezer Mayenda – who started the opening day of the following season in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "A high-scoring draw in which Newcastle led but needed two equalisers to salvage a point despite having more than twice as many shots, leaving them bottom of the Premier League in late November, confirmed for many the suspicion that this would be a rehash of his exciting but defensively-flawed Bournemouth reign.",
      "Joelinton scored in a neat indicator of his prosperous future under Howe, who was actually confined to a hotel room with the ‘rona and so happily handed over the reins to a bashful and reluctant Jason Tindall. If Newcastle’s manager would prefer we can instead assess his first game in the dugout: a 2-0 loss to Arsenal the following week.",
      "",
      "Ipswich provided a first taste of English football for Slot, who would have known that while anything but a win against their promoted hosts would have been a disaster, no standard of victory could possibly have dispelled those festering post-Klopp concerns.",

      "“I am so happy… it was a special day today,” said the new Villa boss after taking charge for the first time, when they made United look very much second-best. Villa fans almost universally welcomed Emery’s appointment after a year of Steven Gerrard and the players buzzed off it too, racing into a two-goal lead inside 11 minutes. Even when United pulled one back courtesy of a lucky deflection, Villa still kept their visitors at arm’s length and ran out comfortable winners.

      "Gareth Southgate taking to LinkedIn to somehow both support and one-up Liam Rosenior’s “if you split the two words it’s ‘man’ and ‘age’ – you’re ageing men” spiel is a great bit.",
      "Those are 14 unimprovable paragraphs on a Leader, Manager, Coach ethos presumably inspired by John Terry, and the modern ‘erosion of a Manager’s authority’. And yes, Southgate obviously capitalises the word ‘manager’. Probably does the same with ‘club’ too, ffs.",
      "Jeremy Cross of the Daily Mirror was among the many to read that Southgate thinkpiece, and he goes with this opening paragraph:",
      "‘The timing of Gareth Southgate’s comments couldn’t be more ironic.’",
      "It’s not exactly like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife, is it? Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid have all dispensed with head coaches recently after losing the ‘power struggles’ of which Southgate speaks.",
      "On goes Cross:",
      "‘Within 48 hours of Steve Holland being parachuted into Manchester United, Southgate has gone public with his views on the current power struggle between managers and club bosses.’",
      "Not entirely sure that Steve Holland or his short-term appointment to a new Manchester United coaching staff is emblematic of ‘the current power struggle between managers and club bosses’ but okay.",
      "Cross continues, quoting Southgate:",
      "‘”The erosion of a manager’s authority has been a gradual process over many years,” he said. “It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of Football, Technical, or Sporting Directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the Head Coach.",
      "‘”Personally, I have no issue with this evolution. Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation – and a football club is no different.”",
      "‘Is it a nod to United co-owner and friend Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he’s still around and available for work?’",
      "No.",
      "Cross ends an almost entirely pointless opinion piece by saying that whatever happens at Manchester United going forward, Southgate ‘is keeping himself relevant’.",
      "By posting his thoughts to 29,137 followers on the hub of viral activity that is LinkedIn? Cross’ definition of ‘relevant’ sounds about as accurate as his grasp of ‘ironic’.",
      "",
      "That Southgate post is manna from heaven for an uncomfortable number of shameless outlets.",
      "The bloke literally wrote about the inherent problems in ‘moving from the title of Manager to Head Coach,’ dismissing the idea it is pure ‘semantics’ and writing:",
      "‘When I was offered the role of Head Coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to Manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.’",
      "A reminder of how Ruben Amorim basically sealed his Manchester United fate.",
      "So yeah, this was no come-and-get-me plea from Southgate, no ‘nod’ to Ratcliffe and Ineos that he is willing to swoop in and rescue them. If that was A Thing then Manchester United would probably have appointed the unemployed man already, instead of just picking his former assistant up for a few months.",
      "We thus get headlines from the likes of usual bastions of reliabilty GBNews, such as ‘Gareth Southgate makes sly dig at Man Utd set-up amid speculation over future aims’.",
      "And the Daily Express website wilfully ignoring Southgate’s point to instead write that he ‘has said he has no problem with directors of football eroding a manager’s authority,’ without stopping even for a second to wonder how batsh*t insane a thing that might be for an actual manager to say.",
      "Happy to confirm what we all suspected: nothing good can possibly ever come of a story based on LinkedIn quotes of all things.",
      "",
      "Mediawatch does not especially disagree with the general sentiment that there are a handful of Premier League clubs who could do with, as Andy Dunn of the Daily Mirror puts it, ‘the ‘ice-cold finisher’ Ivan Toney.",
      "The bloke scored 20 goals in his last full Premier League season less than three years ago. If he is available and affordable then Your Evertons and The West Hams Of This World could probably do with that level of attacking quality – if indeed it still exists after a season and a half in Saudi.",
      "What Dunn can and should be pulled up on is the feigned surprise that Toney is ‘somehow’ not really part of the England conversation any more.",
      "The 29-year-old does indeed have 18 goals in 24 games for Al-Ahli this season, but eight of those have been penalties and he has not scored or assisted in any of his last four appearances for his club and country as a substitute: the role he absolutely would be still playing for England if he was in the picture.",
      "That feels more pertinent than him making someone look silly with a stoppage-time penalty recently.",
      "But as Dunn writes, Toney’s World Cup hopes are basically ‘non-existent’.",
      "‘They should not be,’ he adds, because ‘Toney’s form and composure surely demands Tuchel take another good look at him,’ since having him in the squad means ‘you are taking a penalty taker of the very, very highest order’.",
      "Two points:",
      "1) Are England really still doing the ‘make space in the squad specifically for a specialist penalty taker’ in 2026? They’re all quite good at them now; Toney did score in the shoot-out against Switzerland at Euro 2024 but so did everyone else.",
      "England last missed a penalty in the final of Euro 2020. They definitely need to use a squad spot on someone who won’t play unless there is a sniff of a spot kick.",
      "2) When Jordan Henderson moved to Al-Ettifaq, one writer condemned the ‘significantly lower standard of play’ and ‘mediocrity of the Pro League,’ adding that ‘life in the Saudi Pro League means Henderson’s days in an England shirt are surely coming to an end.",
      "‘He cannot go to the Euros on the back of an entire season in Saudi,’ Dunn added back then. If only Henderson had mugged off Mailson of Al-Taawoun; he’d have been an obvious squad pick.",
      "",
      "‘Jones almost certainly would not refer to himself as a United legend but someone ill-informed in the club’s corporate department thought he was worthy of the title.’",
      "Are things okay at home, Samuel?",
      "Liam Rosenior can’t even crack the top five with a 5-1 win in his first game in charge of Chelsea, while Michael Carrick will hope to be more Emery, less ...",

      "Man Utd ‘are desperately seeking to revamp their midfield in the upcoming summer transfer window’ and the Premier League giants ‘have identified the young Spaniard as the ideal playmaker for their new project’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy are convinced that Barrios ‘would bring the clarity and passing ability that the current squad urgently needs to generate attacking football’.",
      "On the potential signing of Barrios, the report adds: ‘The signing of the Spanish Under-21 international reflects a clear intention to rejuvenate the squad with technically gifted players hungry for continental glory. Manchester United doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes and prefers to invest in proven players from top-level leagues rather than unfinished prospects.",
      "‘Pablo Barrios fits this description of a versatile player who can operate both as a holding midfielder and an attacking midfielder, consistently making runs into the opposition’s penalty area.’",

      "“Gallagher has obviously been spoken about as a midfield option but Barrios would actually be a very good fit for what United want long term – and Amorim doesn’t just want a loan in midfield or to sign someone for the sake of it. He wants players that fit the longer vision.",
      "“Atleti won’t want to lose him because he has become very important in their midfield but I think there could be some potential for them to have a fight on their hands to keep Barrios across 2026.”",

      "The former Middlesbrough boss is expected to start with a back four as Darren Fletcher did in his two games in (even more) interim charge, and former Red Devils defender Paul Parker expects Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw – who look set to start as the full-backs – to struggle against City’s wingers.",
      "“Well, you don’t have to be an ex-full-back or an ex-defender. you can be the man on the street, and you know that the full-backs that United have got are going to struggle,” he told Metro via online casinos UK.",

      "“When it gets close to the goal and then you’re a little bit more congested as a team, compact, then yes, you can understand it and that makes it easier because there’s more players around. But the last thing you want to be doing is getting caught too far up the park one-against-ones.",

The snarling, the shouting, the talk of standards never translated into building a team or managing people. Once that door closed, the managerial career ended and the pundit persona took over.",

      "It included a Brighton loan, 2 academy players, a free agent, a player who has been injured for 4 months and a goal keeper, £1.3 billion???? It’s a Private Equity business so the reality we are being driven on a model similar to Dortmund. Identify and purchase the best young talent, develop and sell. Next year we should see the arrival of Penders, Sarr, Quenda, Emegha, Barco, average age 20.7!!! The injury to Palmer may buy us an extra year with him, but Cucurella and Fernandez possibly off to City and PSG respectively.",

Look at the managers, apart from Guardiola, there is no super managers here. You may make a case for Emery and Arteta if he wins this year. But the rest are definitely potential only.",

      "Interesting to see Garey Vance bring up Wenger’s “daylight” offside proposal this morning. I’d coincidentally read a reference to it a couple of hours previously so it was fresh in the mind.",
      "So far as I can tell, the arguments for a (big) revision to the offside rule are that it will help to clarify the current VAR mess, and that there will be more goals if attackers have more leeway. In theory I suppose they’re both correct, but in practice would it really be the case?",
      "Taking the VAR angle first – the lines don’t go away if the point of intersection between onside/offside is moved. Instead of a toe ahead of the defensive line being the determinant as it is now, we’ll just see a toe intersecting with the last defender’s silhouette. We’ll still be at the mercy of the competence or otherwise of the same set of minions at the PGMOL.",
      "Maybe more important though is the knock-on effect of allowing attackers a generous margin for error when making their runs. Taken in isolation, it sounds great and should allow them to unpick defences with far higher regularity. More chances = more goals, better game to watch, everybody wins.",
      "But how will defenders react to having their margin of error narrowed dramatically? I can only think of one natural response, and that’s to close off the spaces in behind. Start with a line 10-15 yards deeper so they’re in a more secure position when possession turns over, and adopt a low block as a necessity when the opposition has sustained possession.",
      "Of course players will still manage to get in behind when an attack is quick enough or imaginative enough to pull that defence apart, but I’m not convinced that we’d necessarily have a flood of high-scoring games as a result of such a dramatic change to the rule.",
      "No issue with seeing this trialled at some level of the game, it would still be an interesting experiment. But does anyone else think that there should always be a place in the game for defending to be preserved as an art and an appropriate challenge to the attackers?",
      "Football is a low-scoring sport by nature, and that has never prevented it from becoming the most popular game in the world. It can definitely be improved, and VAR reform is definitely part of that. But there has to be a way to align it with the spirit of the game instead of looking to rewrite one of the core laws of the game, doesn’t there?\nKeith Reilly",

      "Wirtz was offside. It was obviously offside. He himself didn’t celebrate as he knew he was offside. The commentary team described it as offside. And both the ref, and the lino, flagged it as offside. Everyone in the ground was on the same page.",
      "However, after a delay, the goal was given.",
      "Not because VAR could prove the ref was wrong, but because they have declared that the technology is not good enough to accurately determine when exactly a ball is kicked, and so to that end being ‘forensic’ about lines on a screen is a faux science. There are therefore ‘thickening the lines’ of offside players to give the benefit of the doubt to the attacking side.",
      "So-as to be consistent with potential future cases which may require the benefit of the doubt, they granted an offside goal.",
      "It is, as far as I am aware, the first instance of VAR over-ruling a correct decision. Or at the very least, of VAR over-ruling an on field decision because the person in a booth could not confirm if the ref was correct.",
      "This breaks the game.",
      "And beyond that, the dangerous loon in a suit who created this law has said it should be ‘good news’ to fans as it rewards attacking play.

      "Michael Carrick has refuted suggestions that Manchester United is a soulless club and says he's returned to a \"magic\" at the club's Carrington training complex.",
      "The former United midfielder returned to the club - where he had also previously held an assistant coaching role and been caretaker manager in 2021 - this week after replacing Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese left the club after 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Middlesbrough boss is the 11th different person to sit in the hotseat at Old Trafford since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Another managerial switch has added to fan discontent with protests planned for next month.",
      "Asked whether he felt the club is now soulless within their current slump, Carrick said: \"I certainly don't think it's soulless. I think there's a magic around this place. I feel it and I feel at home straight away, coming into the building.",
      "\"Results and sometimes from the outside things look a little bit different, but it certainly doesn't feel majorly different on the inside.",
      "\"Part of my role and the responsibility is shaping what we want to look like going forward as a group. What happens on the pitch and the tactical side and the performances is one thing, but certainly the culture as well and how we think, how we act, how we behave, what it means to us to be here - that's something that is part of my responsibility to spread in the right way.\"",
      "Carrick adds that player mood has been positive and that the training ground has been in a good place.",
      "\"I've been back in this role for three days and there's nothing that I've looked at that's really red-flagged anything. The players have been really good.",
      "\"[The players are] willing to listen, willing to learn, wanting to do better, wanting to do better for the club, wanting to put on better performances. That's the feeling I've got.",
      "\"The support staff and everyone is desperate to do well and we need to channel that.",
      "\"The culture is something that happens day-to-day. It's not something I sit here and talk about - a few words here and there and it makes it sound good.",
      "\"It's how you behave and what you end up doing day-to-day. That's something we've got to build but certainly at the moment, I feel it's a good place and the training ground's been a really good place.",
      "\"We need to make Old Trafford an even better place with the help of the supporters as well. That's the magic of what we're trying to do.\"",

      "Friday 16 January 2026 18:08, UK",
      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend and tips Manchester City to win a thrilling Manchester derby.",
      "Brentford rocking up at Stamford Bridge doesn't feel like a mismatch anymore - in fact, it's becoming a fixture they quietly look forward to. They've lost just once in their last eight visits across west London and that tells you everything about the mentality of this team. There is no fear.",
      "And right now, they are absolutely humming.",
      "Brentford are in the middle of their best unbeaten Premier League run of the season - six games without defeat, winning four of the last five. And since December 14, no Premier League team has picked up more points than the Bees (14). They are 11/10 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "Leeds are a great watch and their games are quite chaotic by design. They play on the edge, get in your face and they ask questions of the opposition, but they also invite pressure. Across their last 18 fixtures their games are averaging 3.5 goals and they've kept just one clean sheet in that period.",
      "Fulham arrive as the perfect dance partner to punt on goals with over 2.5 looking very generous at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "They've scored in their last 12 matches across all competitions, showing a level of attacking consistency that travels well. Marco Silva's side don't need huge dominance to find the net either - they're sharp in transition, clever in the half-spaces and dangerous from wide areas.",
      "Arne Slot's Liverpool are beginning to look like a serious team again.",
      "The big shift has come in their structure in defence. Slot has clearly prioritised control without the ball, giving Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate proper protection in front of them rather than leaving them exposed, which in turn has cut out the silly errors costing them goals.",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have conceded just five goals. That's not smoke and mirrors either. The expected goals against data backs it up nicely at 0.8 per 90, pointing to a side that is limiting high-quality chances rather than relying on last-ditch defending or goalkeeping heroics.",
      "When you combine Liverpool's improved defensive process with Burnley's limited attacking threat, Liverpool to win to nil shapes up as a shrewd play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace arrive off the back of that damaging FA Cup exit, knocked out in the third round by non-league Macclesfield. The instinctive reaction is to expect a fierce response. But history strongly pushes back against that idea.",
      "Looking at the last 13 Premier League teams dumped out by League One opposition or below at that stage, the next-game record reads poorly: three wins, four draws and six defeats. And even those three wins were by the bare minimum - a single-goal margin. There's no evidence of a bounce-back surge. If anything, the hangover lingers.",
      "Sunderland remain unbeaten at home this season - a run built on energy, structure and a crowd that turns the Stadium of Light into a very uncomfortable place to visit. They look a great price on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville are the livewires for West Ham. Stop them, and you largely stop West Ham.",
      "The problem for the visitors is that they're running into a Tottenham side specifically designed to take that weapon away.",
      "One of the defining traits of Thomas Frank's Spurs is how well they manage transition moments. They don't allow games to become stretched, they recover their shape quickly and they suffocate counter-attacks before they ever get going. That's backed up by the numbers.",
      "Across the season, Spurs have conceded the second-fewest fast breaks in the league (11) - and crucially, they haven't conceded a single goal from a fast break.",
      "There's also a very strong angle under Frank in that nine of his 10 wins as Spurs boss have come to nil. When Tottenham win, they don't just win, they shut the door. It's 2/1 with Sky Bet to land again.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes is quietly becoming a magnet for fouls. Not because he's theatrical, but because of how Arsenal use him. He steps in aggressively during build-up, carries the ball forward into pressure and is constantly involved in physical duels at set pieces. That combination naturally invites contact and referees have been happy to blow the whistle.",
      "The recent numbers underline that trend. Gabriel has been fouled at least once in nine of his last 10 starts, averaging 1.53 fouls drawn per 90. That's a healthy baseline for a centre-back, and it puts the 2+ fouls line well within reach in the right type of game at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Here, he's coming up against Igor Jesus.",
      "The Forest striker is aggressive, raw and still learning when to step in and when to back off. He's committed 22 fouls across his recent matches.",
      "Wolves have quietly become a very difficult team to score against. The standout trend in their recent performances is defensive improvement, and it's backed up by serious underlying numbers.",
      "Across their last six games, only Arsenal can better Wolves' expected goals against process of 0.99 per 90. That's elite territory. Wolves have faced Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United in that spell. So while the sample size is small, the quality of opposition gives those numbers real credibility.",
      "We know Newcastle are a very different proposition away from St James' Park - and it's the attacking drop-off that's most striking. In their last 17 Premier League away games, they've scored more than 1.5 goals just three times.",
      "On average, Newcastle are managing just 1.2 goals per away game in that run, struggling to generate sustained pressure or high-quality chances on their travels. The 6/5 with Sky Bet on them scoring under 1.5 goals again on the road looks a winner in waiting.",
      "David Moyes' record away from home against top-level opposition is horrendous.",
      "Going all the way back to his West Ham days, his record away at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City reads 20 losses from 21 games. It's a brutal return.",
      "Those games tend to follow the same script too: sit deep, limit damage, slow the tempo and hope to stay in the contest for as long as possible. Now, this fixture doesn't technically fall into that bracket - but at what point do we start calling Aston Villa an elite home side?",
      "Villa Park has become a fortress. They've won their last 11 home games, a run that includes statement victories over Arsenal and Manchester City. The intensity, structure and belief Unai Emery has created there is right up there with the very best in the league.",
      "Moyes' away games are rarely chaotic though. Since returning to Everton, just two of his 20 away matches have gone over 3.5 goals, with the average sitting at just 1.8 goals per 90. That's why combining a Villa win and under 3.5 goals makes sense at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth's away games this season are bonkers. They're averaging 4.8 goals per game on the road. Nope, not a typo. Yes, almost five goals per game.",
      "The markets are fully aligned for goals in this one though, which naturally pushes us toward the anytime goalscorer angle.",
      "And who better to target than Kaoru Mitoma? The Japanese winger is starting to look like his old sparky, nightmare-for-defenders self. His movement, bursts in behind and instinct for goal are all back in evidence - as shown by his goal vs Manchester City.",
      "History gives us even more confidence. Mitoma has scored five goals in his last six games against Bournemouth - that bit of a psychological edge over the opposition isn't factored into the prices at 5/2 with Sky Bet.",

      "Neville wished his former team‑mate well but warned any new‑manager bounce under Carrick, however transformative, should not be viewed as a long‑term solution.",
      "\"I hope Michael does really well,\" former United captain Neville told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"We could be sat here at the end of the season with the fans up, with the team fifth in the table and back in the Champions League spots, and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "\"But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.\"",
      "Neville accepted the decision to sack Amorim and hand Carrick the reins until the end of the season was ultimately the right one, but could not hide his disappointment at the sense of déjà vu it left.",
      "\"When Amorim was sacked and you started hearing the names Michael, Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], Ruud [van Nistelrooy], it felt a bit sad, like 'we're here again',\" he said.",
      "\"We've been there before with Ole, with Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] when David Moyes was sacked. We've seen this movie before.",
      "\"I don't think there was any other option for the club right now. Most United fans will agree with the decision to get to the end of the season because of the managers who are becoming available.",
      "\"But if they weren't to get the manager in the summer, there will be massive pressure. They must be thinking they're going to get one of the big ones, otherwise they wouldn't have appointed a bridge now.\"",
      "Carrick's return to Old Trafford marks his second spell as interim manager and the 12th managerial change of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "Neville outlined the essential attributes United's next permanent manager must have - and explained why Carlo Ancelotti, Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino best fit that bill.",
      "\"Manchester United have tried everything when it comes to appointing a manager, absolutely everything,\" Neville said. \"They just have to try to remove risks now.",
      "\"Who can handle the media? Who can sort the dressing room out? Who can handle the owners? Who plays a style of football that fans will at least enjoy watching? Who has Champions League experience? Who has big‑game experience?",
      "\"The three that stand out are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe - who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle - is another.",
      "\"To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "\"United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I'm not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.\"",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth in the first half of the season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo provides another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right across his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different and his penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne impressed in helping Guardiola's side keep out Newcastle on Tuesday but they are 21 and 20 respectively and only have 11 Premier League starts between them. Carrick should make it his mission to test them at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's back three is no more. Amorim's exit may also signal the end of Bruno Fernandes playing in a midfield two. He returned to the No 10 role in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge and will surely continue there under Carrick, who used a 4-2-3-1 formation in 112 of his 124 league games in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Fernandes' heat maps show an increase in activity in his own half in the last two seasons, illustrating how his role changed under Amorim. It is to the 31-year-old's credit that, despite being asked to play deeper, crowbarred into a system that did not suit him, he continued to carry the same influence in the final third.",
      "This season, he ranks either top or second among Premier League players in a host of creative metrics. His total of 56 chances created is the highest by any player not just in the Premier League but in any of the major European leagues.",
      "Not bad for a guy playing out of position.",
      "Now what can he do back at No 10?",
      "Join David Jones and Jamie Carragher for Brighton vs Bournemouth on Monday Night Football from 7pm, kick-off 8pm.",

      "Saturday 17 January 2026 12:25, UK",
      "\"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "That's the sentiment that a number of Manchester United fans and even members of Mainoo's own family haven't been shy in making known over the past year. Under Ruben Amorim, it's fair to say the 20-year-old's early career and momentum hit a major bump in the road.",
      "The midfielder - who Gary Neville once said had \"the world at his feet\" after his maiden games - played a key role for England as the Three Lions reached the Euros final in 2024.",
      "Now, still yet to make a Premier League start this season but still harbouring hopes of making a sensational return to the national team fold, Mainoo has Michael Carrick to learn from.",
      "United's new interim head coach patrolled the midfield to great distinction in his playing days. Now, with the middle of the park a lingering concern at Old Trafford, one of his many tasks will be freeing Mainoo.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick said in the summer on Rio Meets, asked about Mainoo.",
      "\"He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom. I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and create and take the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get.",
      "\"He's got it and he's shown that. It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",
      "Asked a direct question whether he'd build the current United team around him, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to.",
      "\"United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",
      "\"To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that, you can say they get it, they know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",
      "The same thoughts were echoed by Carrick, who told Rio Ferdinand that a \"good midfielder can play in different ways\". Mainoo has been the subject of an experiment to test that theory since he broke through.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, the then 18-year-old was handed his first start at the foot of United's midfield at Everton, impressing alongside Scott McTominay. A flash in the pan turned to a crash in the box as his first season as being involved in the first game culminated in a winning goal in the FA Cup final, again, as part of a midfield two - this time partnering Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "For England, Mainoo would go on to fill a similar role as a No 8 alongside Declan Rice at the Euros, starting every game from the last group stage onwards.",
      "Amorim's eventual arrival at Man Utd plunged Mainoo's role into doubt. Initially used as part of a two, sat ahead of Amorim's infamous back three, Mainoo would go on to be deployed as a No 10 and as a false No 9 at times throughout the course of the season.",
      "In this campaign, Amorim made it clear that Mainoo would be challenging for a spot in the team against an immovable Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, up until his injury in December, had started every game this season bar United's Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "However, his injury didn't provide an opportunity for Mainoo as he too picked up a knock that ruled him out until Fernandes' return. The 3-4-2-1 didn't suit Mainoo but in a return to a flatter back four upon his return to the team under Darren Fletcher, he showed some promise.",
      "The 4-2-3-1 was Carrick's most-used formation during his time at Middlesbrough, with the former Man Utd midfielder setting up that way in 90% of his matches in charge at the Riverside.",
      "Mainoo could emerge as one of the key beneficiaries of Carrick's 17 games in charge at his old stomping ground. Maybe then, we might see a change in matchday attire for any members of the Mainoo family concerned about his lack of 'freedom'.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as Premier League clubs try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal are most effective side, Liverpool least, but what are they doing differently? And where does every team rank?",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright and David Fraser",
      "Friday 16 January 2026 09:38, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "Spurs are another side enjoying success with inswingers. They have an even higher proportion of inswinging deliveries than Arsenal at 83 per cent and rank as the only side with a better corner conversion rate than the Gunners, as per the graphic below.",
      "By using inswingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "There is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",
