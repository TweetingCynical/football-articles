      "The grandson of Black Sabbath legend and Aston Villa fan Ozzy Osbourne was among the mascots as the club took on Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday. Sidney, the son of Ozzy's daughter Kelly, was carried out by Villa captain John McGinn before the match.",
      "Villa paid tribute to Ozzy back in August after the rock star died at the age of 76. He played his final gig at their Villa Park stadium back in July, just weeks before his death.",
      "Following Osbourne's death, Villa paid a tribute of their own. \"Aston Villa Football Club is saddened to learn that world-renowned rockstar and Villan, Ozzy Osbourne has passed away,\" a statement from the club read at the time.",
      "\"Growing up in Aston, not far from Villa Park, Ozzy always held a special connection to the club and the community he came from. The thoughts of everyone at Aston Villa are with his wife Sharon, his family, friends, and countless fans at this extremely difficult time. Rest in peace, Ozzy.\"",
      "Ozzy's daughter Kelly got engaged to partner Sid Wilson before her father's final show. The couple were seen on the pitch with youngster Sidney ahead of kick-off in Sunday's match against United.",
      "Ozzy's final Villa Park show saw him joined by original members of Black Sabbath for a concert dubbed 'back to the beginning'. At the time, he spoke about the significance of the event.",
      "\"It’s my final encore; it’s my chance to say thank you to my fans for always supporting me and being there for me. I couldn’t have done my final show anywhere else. I had to go back to the beginning,\" he said.",
      "On the pitch, Villa hosted United knowing three points would keep their title charge alive. They had won their last two matches in dramatic fashion, scoring a last-gasp winner to beat Arsenal before coming from behind for a 3-2 victory at West Ham.",
      "\"Villa are definitely in the title race for me,\" former Villa and United striker Dion Dublin told Match of the Day. \"I think in Unai Emery they have a manager who knows how to maintain performance levels and keep them firing.\"",
      "\"The elite teams always stay humble. I also think it is a mindset thing, we have to stay strong mentally, especially if you are on this run. We know it can stop at any time. The way we are going and the players that we have, I believe that we can go very far if we keep doing what we're doing and working hard.\"",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic played under four different managers during his Old Trafford spell. Jose Mourinho brought him to Old Trafford, but it was the Portuguese's successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who Matic believes was dismissed too early.",
      "Solskjaer replaced Mourinho in December 2019, initially on an interim basis before being appointed permanently. He was the second United boss of Matic's five years at Old Trafford, eventually losing his job in 2021",
      "Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick spent time in interim charge after Solskjaer's dismissal, which came after a 4-1 loss at Watford left United seventh in the Premier League. Reflecting on the Norwegian's stint four years later, though, Matic argued United pulled the trigger too soon.",
      "“We finished second and third under him. There was an atmosphere in the team that we weren’t happy finishing second, but when you see the results now, we did amazingly,\" Matic told FourFourTwo",
      "“I think Ole deserved more time – and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.",
      "“Of course, they made the decision to sack Ole based on his final couple of results, but he was an amazing person with the right profile for the club. He and his assistants understood football – training was perfect and had every little detail ready for us.\"",
      "Matic praised Solskjaer, in part for how he was able to keep players on board even when they weren't playing regularly. The Serbian started just four of United's 12 league games in his final season, but recognised the manager was someone who knew the club.",
      "Matic would go on to leave Old Trafford in the summer of 2022, linking back up with Mourinho at Roma. He then spent time in France, playing for Rennes and Lyon, and is now back in Italy with Sassuolo.",
      "Solskjaer took time out after leaving United, eventually ending his exile from management when he took over at Besiktas midway through the 2024/25 season. He was dismissed by the Turkish club in August, though, and spoke in November about a potential return to the dugout.",
      "\"I'm open, it's not like I'm desperate to be back but England, I love living here, I think so,\" he told Stick to Football. \"My kids ask me mid-Championship and up, but I’m a football man. Is it Norway? Sweden? It’s about working with people. When I played Football Manager and Championship Manager, I like to defy the odds.\"",

      "Manchester United's skipper Bruno Fernandes reportedly has a release clause in his contract that is only applicable to clubs outside the Premier League. Since joining from Sporting in January 2020 for just under £50million, the Portuguese midfielder has become a key player for the Red Devils.",
      "He was appointed captain by ex-manager Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has since racked up over 300 appearances for the club. Under the guidance of Ruben Amorim this season, Fernandes has netted five goals and provided seven assists in his 17 outings across all competitions.",
      "His importance to the team is undeniable, but there was a chance he might not have been at Old Trafford this season if certain members of United's top brass had their way last summer.",
      "Earlier this month, Fernandes dropped a bombshell, revealing that some were trying to push him out of the club during the previous transfer window after a hefty offer came in from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Despite the prospect of a significant salary increase, Fernandes chose to stay at Old Trafford, with Amorim also keen to retain him, despite apparent opposition from higher up.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he recently confessed to Canal 11. \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, I always play, good or bad.",
      "\"I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Following the interview, which has once again cast doubt over Fernandes' future at Old Trafford, it has now come to light that the midfielder may have an exit clause written into his deal.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, the clause can only be activated by clubs outside England. \"There is a release clause in the contract of Bruno Fernandes,\" Romano revealed in his latest YouTube video.",
      "\"And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It's only for clubs abroad. It is slightly over €60million (£52.5m). So, nothing is imminent.",
      "\"Nothing is happening. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on the interest from Saudi because I think from Saudi, they can return for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Then it's going to be up to Bruno, up to Man Utd again. Let's see what's going to happen before or after the World Cup.\"",
      "Meanwhile, United are gearing up for Sunday's Premier League clash against Aston Villa. A triumph in the Midlands will bring them on par with Liverpool and Chelsea, each holding 29 points.",

      "Ruben Amorim has not ruled out January transfers for Manchester United and only wants players who can strengthen his team even after Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui return from AFCON. That is not always a simple task, but it could help the Portuguese coach kick on this season.",
      "United could go into Christmas in fifth place with a victory over Aston Villa, and new signings could offer a timely boost for Amorim, having already strengthened his squad in the summer with Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. Perhaps other areas now need attention.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said when asked if money was available for the transfer window. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "\"We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Antoine Semenyo may be top of the agenda, given the opportunity his £65million release clause provides. The Bournemouth star favours a move to Liverpool, but already met Amorim last summer.",
      "The Portuguese coach is interested in fielding Semenyo as a wingback should he arrive and is said to be unconvinced by his current options. That could see an aggressive set of wingbacks in Amad and Semenyo, when the United boss returns to his favoured formation.",
      "The duo would flank a back three of Leny Yoro , Mathhijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez, who would play in front of Senne Lammens. Luke Shaw would be a stiff contender for a spot, but Martinez's passing may give him an edge.",
      "United's midfield could see further additions, with the centre of midfield a priority area for the club. The Guardian reports that Ruben Neves is an option as his contract in Saudi Arabia winds down.",
      "Neves, 28, would cost in the region £20m but could bring significant wage demands after commanding £350,000-a-week. Conor Gallagher could prove to be an alternative option, while it is claimed United are interested in Bournemouth ace Tyler Adams.",
      "Neves would be a strong candidate to start alongside Bruno Fernandes and to keep possession ticking. Tyler Adams may offer more robustness, but is out injured currently, and a second midfield addition may only open the possibility of Old Trafford exits.",
      "A fron three was decided by United's significant summer business. Mbeumo and Cunha will provide plenty of support for Sesko if he can keep Mason Mount of the side.",
      "Possible United lineup: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Neves, Fernandes, Semenyo; Mbeumo, Sesko, Cunha.",

      "Germany star Karim Adeyemi will be hit with a fine by Borussia Dortmund following his reaction to being substituted against Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday. The 23-year-old has been linked with a Premier League switch, making it clear he favours Arsenal over Manchester United, but for now remains at Signal Iduna Park",
      "Controversy has followed Adeyemi around of late. The forward, who is represented by Jorge Mendes, recently issued an apology after being fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons (a knuckeduster and a taser), claiming they arrived in a ‘mystery box’ he ordered online.",
      "Adeyemi has six goals and three assists to his name this season, and has either started or come off the bench in every one of Dortmund's Bundesliga games. He lasted an hour against Gladbach on Friday but appeared none too happy about being withdrawn by manager Niko Kovac.",
      "Sporting director Sebastian Kehl intervened when Adeyemi attempted to walk straight down the tunnel. Speaking to Sky Germany after the game (via Yahoo), Kehl explained the situation in more detail while confirming a fine was incoming.",
      "“I told him: He’s not going to the locker room, he’s sitting there,“ Kehl said. ”The substitution was totally justified. Karim didn’t play well. He will be punished for it. I don’t want to see that reaction and neither does the coach or anyone else. It’s not right, and Karim knows that too.",
      "“We’ve discussed this issue intensively with the team in recent weeks. If a player is unhappy, he can express it in the locker room or in the next day’s training session.“",
      "Kovac, meanwhile, said the substitution was performance-based and might even have happened earlier. \"I could have made the substitution at halftime, but I didn’t want to. I wanted to give him another chance,” the Croatian said.",
      "Dortmund led early against Gladbach through Julian Brandt but had to wait until the final minute for Maximilian Beier to make the points safe. It means Kovac's side sit second heading into the winter break, albeit still some way adrift of league leaders Bayern Munich.",
      "“I’m very happy that we won. At the end of the day, it was deserved,\" Kovac said. \"We only allowed Gladbach one dangerous chance and missed one or two really good chances ourselves.",
      "\"We started well, but then didn’t do so well in the last 15 minutes of the first half. Gladbach came back a bit then. In the second half, it was an open game. We have to continue to work hard, stay focused, work together with the ball, but also against the ball. Then this team definitely have what it takes to finish in the top four.”",

      "Chelsea snapped up Garnacho from United in August for £40 million following a breakdown in his relationship with Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim. Just over a year earlier, in December 2024, United had celebrated Garnacho after the 21-year-old winger was crowned FIFA Puskas Award winner, highlighting the club's deep appreciation for their player.",
      "Despite the affection shown to Garnacho by the Red Devils, it seems the feeling wasn't entirely mutual, with Garnacho showing no remorse about departing the red half of Manchester. The Argentine claimed the award for his spectacular goal against Everton in November 2023, when he executed a remarkable overhead kick.",
      "After the strike was recognised as the finest goal scored anywhere on the planet between August 2023 and August 2024, United made sure to praise their young talent. Their message suggested a lengthy future together lay ahead.",
      "A United statement said: \"Congratulations to Alejandro Garnacho, who is the winner of the FIFA Puskas Award for 2024. The Manchester United winger has been recognised for the stunning, acrobatic bicycle kick he netted at Everton in November 2023. Well done to our No. 17, and thanks to all those who supported him. It's a goal that we'll cherish for years to come.\"",
      "Garnacho, even followed the footsteps of his idol Cristiano Ronaldo to become only the second United player to win the award after the Portuguese superstar, is now donning Chelsea blue. Ronaldo was the first recipient of the award back in 2009 for his long-range goal against FC Porto during the 2008/09 season while playing for United.",
      "A year later, Garnacho has swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge and he's not looking back. The winger candidly admitted that his departure from United wasn't a heart-wrenching affair.",
      "He even suggested that leaving United was a necessary move for his career progression. When asked if he had any regrets, Garnacho simply responded, \"No.\" Probed further about whether he felt any sadness over how his time at United concluded, he reiterated: \"No.\"",
      "He added: \"Sometimes in life you need to change things to take a step forward or improve as a player,\" Garnacho explained. \"It was the right moment, and the right club. So it was an easy decision.\"",
      "Upon joining Chelsea, Garnacho didn't hold back in praising his new club during an interview with the official Chelsea media channel.",
      "\"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special,\" he said. \"We're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "During his time at United, Garnacho made 144 appearances, netting 26 goals and providing 22 assists. While he views his move to west London as the best decision for his career, his farewell message to United suggests he still holds some fondness for his former club.",
      "Garnacho, who has netted four goals and provided two assists in 18 appearances for Chelsea, said: \"After an unforgettable five years, this special chapter in my life now comes to a close. We have created moments that will stay with me forever, and I'm very grateful for this.",
      "\"To the coaches, staff, and my team-mates, thank you for believing in me. Every time I wore the badge, I gave everything I had.

      "\"He is still being young to play football. We signed him in the last moments of the transfer window, because when we identified that possibility, I wanted in that moment everything that he did last week [vs West Ham].",
      "“In 90 minutes he did everything I expected from him. He was really fantastic. Every day it is easy how we are working because his adaptation is so quick, and everything we need, through his experiences, he can give us.",
      "\"He gave us experience before, but maybe the best moment he had until now with us was the match at West Ham. He played a fantastic match. Now, he has shown us his level. He can’t stop now, and he must keep it!",
      "\"He is very mature, of course. This is very important. He is responsible too, and he has experiences, and hopefully he can help us a lot for the rest of the season.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Nicky Butt believes Ruben Amorim might be paving the way for Kobbie Mainoo to depart his boyhood club. The 20-year-old is yet to make a Premier League start this season, and speculation is mounting that he could head out on loan next month, with Napoli leading the chase for his services.",
      "United manager Amorim has stood by his decision to keep the midfielder on the substitutes' bench, insisting \"Kobbie needs to fight for his job\". He added that it's \"not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.\"",
      "Once hailed as United's next big thing after breaking through with a string of impressive displays during the 2023/2024 campaign, both Butt and former Premier League manager Sam Allardyce reckon the youngster's days at Old Trafford could be numbered. The duo also believe Mainoo should now seek opportunities elsewhere.",
      "Speaking exclusively on the Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, in partnership with BOYLE Sports, Butt suggests that Mainoo has found himself trapped in a damaging cycle where extended spells on the sidelines are hampering his ability to make an impact.",
      "The ex-midfielder believes that Mainoo's lacklustre showings when he does feature only serve to vindicate Amorim's choice to regularly bench the youngster, potentially making it easier to offload the star - whether that's in January or during the summer window.",
      "Amorim has extended an open invitation to Mainoo, stating: \"If Mainoo wants to come and talk to me, he can\". However, Butt suspects there's a reason why Mainoo hasn't approached the manager about his lack of game time.",
      "Butt said: \"Nowadays, every player has a management team behind them to look after him. Why is his management team not telling him to go and talk? It might be a case of, don't go in there because we're leaving in January anyway, so I don't really know the ins and outs of it, but it's just a very sad situation.",
      "\"He's a great lad, Kobbie. I've known him since he was around 7 or 8 years of age, he's a great talent. It was only a year ago that he was playing in the Champions League at 18, he's not going to lose his talent overnight.\"",
      "\"Kobbie has played nine games this season, and every single one of them has been as a sub. How can he judge someone off that? When I was at United, I wasn't always starting, I had Keane and Scholes in front of me most of the time, I wasn't always getting game time which is why I left.\"",
      "He added: \"There's nothing worse than being out for five or six games, and then the manager puts you in and says, Go and show me what you've got. Because then you've got no rhythm, it takes you five games to get going, from my own experience.",
      "\"So if Kobbie gets put in the next game, for example, I guarantee you he won't play well. Then the manager goes, I told you so.\"",
      "From a managerial perspective, Allardyce defended Amorim. The 71-year-old feels it's up to Mainoo to seek more game time, but he's concerned that the ongoing saga could dent the young midfielder's confidence and suggested he might need to consider leaving the club.",
      "Allardyce said: \"He's right. He's rather busy and doing what he's doing. Mainoo's priorities are to stand out in training and prove to the manager his worth to go back into the team. It's also his responsibility to go and knock on the door and ask why he's not playing, not the other way around.",
      "\"When you're managing Man United, you haven't got a minute spare. If he's not going to be in the team on Saturday, because he's already got it in his mind whether he is or he isn't, then Mainoo doesn't take priority. He needs to impress to get a chance to be put back in, and he can't wait too long before he has to leave.\"",
      "He went on to say: \"If you destroy somebody's confidence, it's very difficult for them to come back. He's not destroying his confidence on purpose. Whoever Mainoo has around him outside of the football club has a massive responsibility to keep him on track. The amount of players I've seen just finish their training, get their clothes on, and go home is ridiculous. They don't even try to impress the manager.",
      "\"Amorim can't give him four or five games to get back on track, because he hasn't got the time. He needs the results now, or he'll be going next.",
      "\"He [Mainoo] needs to get away. It'll be foolish for him to sign a new contract at Man United and be a squad player. You play football because it's a talent you've been given and the dream of so many millions of others that haven't made it, and you've got to go and play football.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has hinted that Manchester United could conduct some business in the January transfer window, but warned it would not be to cope with the absences of Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, and Noussair Mazraoui. Instead, the Portuguese's focus is on acquiring players who are 'the future' of the club.",
      "The United boss saw a number of signings arrive in the summer, including Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. Old Trafford chiefs still have plans to sign a new midfielder after failing to land Carlos Baleba in the summer, with the Brighton star, and Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton among potential candidates.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has been thrust to the forefront of rumours too, however. The Bournemouth ace has a £65million release clause next month and the Red Devils are set to face competition from Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "Amorim met Semenyo in London at the end of last season, and it remains to be seen if that could give United a leg up. It has even been touted that the Ghana international is being eyed as a wing-back.",
      "And asked if United have a budget to make signings in January, Amorim did not rule out the prospect of new players in 2026. The 40-year-old only wants additions who can aid his team over a long-term period.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Amorim said. \"The only thing we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think are going to be the future.",
      "\"It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON. \"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that we need more.",
      "We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Amorim also wants Kobbie Mainoo to stay and fight for his job at United. The midfielder has yet to start a Premier League match this term and has been linked with an exit.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that it's not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" Amorim said.",

      "Ruben Amorim has urged Kobbie Mainoo to remain at Manchester United and \"fight for his job\", pointing to Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo as examples of players who endured periods on the bench before cementing their Old Trafford legacies.",
      "The academy product is yet to start a Premier League match this season and could depart on loan in January, with Napoli leading a queue of clubs interested in securing his services. However, Amorim wants the youngster to stay and prove himself rather than seek opportunities elsewhere.",
      "The manager has criticised club legends who've suggested Mainoo should leave and has now delivered a direct message to the 20-year-old, who is frustrated by his limited opportunities and has become something of a rallying point for supporters who are eager to see home-grown talent given more chances.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" Amorim explained. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing.",

      "Instead, he wants the midfielder to prove him wrong when given the opportunity. Mainoo could be in line for his first league start of the campaign at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim hinting at a tactical shift to a back four that might accommodate him as one of three central midfielders.",
      "Should he get the nod, Amorim encouraged the youngster to channel any frustration into his performance. \"I'm not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let's put him on the bench to show something',\" he explained.",
      "\"No, no. What I'm saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, he's going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me from the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone. I'm just saying that I'm trying to win games and to show to the players that if you do the things right, you will play no matter what the name.\"",
      "Just a week earlier, Amorim had suggested Mainoo could seek a January loan if he wished. That conversation never materialised, but Mainoo's situation took an intriguing twist on Monday when his half-brother Jordan turned up to the Bournemouth match sporting a T-shirt emblazoned with 'Free Kobbie Mainoo'.",
      "\"He's a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",

      "\"But with Sesko coming back, Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don't know how we're going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "\"I'm not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don't go through the group stage, and we don't miss them for too long.",
      "\"The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that's a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they're playing regularly.",
      "\"And now we're starting to see the Mason Mount that we've seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He's a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you're a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.\"",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to find his feet in the Premier League. The striker has netted just twice in the competition, with a knee problem that ruled him out for nearly a month disrupting his progress.",
      "Now back to full fitness, he'll be determined to prove his worth.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is also working his way back to peak condition following a cruciate ligament injury that sidelined him for nearly 300 days. The Argentine defender has faced numerous injury setbacks since arriving at Old Trafford and will be desperate to put those troubles behind him.",
      "Mason Mount, similar to Martinez, has had his fair share of injury woes since joining United. Now back in form, the England international is showing promising signs as a regular starter under Amorim.",
      "United are set to return to the pitch on Sunday, heading to the Midlands to take on high-flying Aston Villa. A win could potentially propel Amorim's team into the top four, depending on other match outcomes.",

      "Ruben Amorim has called on Manchester United’s squad to step up in the absence of their AFCON-bound stars. The Red Devils take on Aston Villa this weekend and are set to be without summer signings Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "The trio have linked up with the Cameroon, Ivory Coast, and Morocco squads, respectively, ahead of the African Cup of Nations. And while the United boss is aware of the impact their absences could have, he has called on the rest of the squad to step up during the tournament.",
      "\"We need to play a little bit different,\" Amorim said to MUTV ahead of Sunday’s trip to Villa Park. \"We lost some one-against-one. We will see but we'll be ready for the game.",
      "\"It's perfect, it's not perfect as we don't have all the players, but we are ready. We have players that can solve the game for us, so are happy with that.",
      "\"Yes [we have lost Amad and Mbeumo] and also Nous,\" Ruben continued. \"So Nous is also really important for us but, when one player is out, we have opportunities for other players.",
      "\"Last year, in some games, we managed to win, especially in Europe, without Amad. Bryan was not here, so we already have those moments of difficulty. So we are ready, more than ready, to cope with that.\"",
      "And while United will be without Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui for the foreseeable future, one man who will provide Amorim with a considerable boost is Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian is now back in contention having missed four matches with a knee injury, while he made a substitute appearance last time against Bournemouth.",
      "\"I think he is a different type of striker,\" Amorim said about the forward. \"The only one in that part because Josh [Zirkzee] is more like a no.9 and 10 at the same time, a little bit like Cunha. Ben is a guy who likes to be in the box. He makes a lot of runs.",
      "\"Of course, if you look at him, you can feel that he has so much more to give. He is improving the physicality, he was one month without playing, but he is ready and he is going to help us.\"",
      "United could potentially jump into the top four with victory against Aston Villa. They will follow up a trip to the Midlands with a Boxing Day clash with Newcastle at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are set to take on an in-form Aston Villa side in the Premier League on Sunday. Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils had to settle for a 4-4 draw in a dramatic encounter with Bournemouth at Old Trafford last time out.",
      "Having come under enormous pressure earlier this season due to poor results, Amorim has found some stability with his team now on 26 points and vying for one of the Champions League spots. The trip to Villa Park is expected to be a challenging affair as the Villans are in the midst of a nine game winning streak in all competitions.",
      "Amorim’s task will be made even more difficult by several of his key players departing for the Africa Cup of Nations. But times of difficulty can bring positive change, which Amorim will hope can be the case.",
      "The rollercoaster draw against Bournemouth saw Amorim deploy a very different version of the 3-4-2-1 system he has rarely strayed from during his year-long tenure. Amad on the right flank played further ahead of the left wing-back, Diogo Dalot, whose position was more akin to a traditional left-back.",
      "Leny Yoro therefore played the right-back role as Amad tucked inside as a midfielder and occasionally moved back to right wing-back. Amorim admitted post-game he had been working on a different shape at Carrington.",
      "That means his formation against Aston Villa on Sunday could once again resemble more of a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2. The Portuguese admitted last week United would have to change once Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui left for the Africa Cup of Nations, which gets underway this weekend.",
      "Given those departures and Casemiro’s suspension, United could line-up with the following starting XI against Unai Emery’s men: Lammens; Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Fernandes, Mainoo; Mount, Sesko, Cunha.",
      "Reports suggest Bournemouth sensation Antoine Semenyo is United’s top transfer target ahead of the January window. The Red Devils could be set for a four-way tussle with Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City for the winger, whose £65million release clause activates at the start of next month.",
      "Semenyo, 25, was linked with an Old Trafford move last summer but Bournemouth’s £80m asking price led United to cool their interest. But Amorim has remained a huge admirer, even describing Semenyo as a “special player” ahead of the draw against the Cherries.",
      "If United successfully land the Ghanaian in January, he could be used as a left-winger in a 4-3-3 or provide a solution to their left wing-back problem in a 3-4-2-1, given Dalot has failed to convince in the role.",
      "Crucially, Ghana have failed to qualify for AFCON, which means Semenyo remains eligible for selection for his new club throughout January if signed.",
      "United could also be active in the transfer market by way of outgoings as they look to fund their pursuit of top talent. In order to pull off fresh signings, reports claim they will listen to offers for their underperforming players, namely Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Malacia was part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ of players who trained away from the first team in the summer but didn’t seal a move away. He has appeared on the bench on several occasions but hasn’t been able to get on the pitch, meaning he could depart in January.",
      "Zirkzee has largely failed to adapt to English football since his £36.5m move from Bologna in 2024. Ugarte has been similarly disappointing since his own £42m move from PSG in the same window, which could see both players transfer listed.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, 20, may also look to leave his boyhood club after failing to break into Amorim’s starting XI. His request for a loan move in the summer was turned down but his growing frustration with a lack of minutes has been a running theme this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Mainoo has yet to start a Premier League match under Ruben Amorim this season and was denied a loan away from the club in the summer transfer window. United are reluctant to sanction an exit in January despite Mainoo's desire for more playing time.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder's brother wore a t-shirt stating 'Free Kobbie Mainoo', in the stands against Bournemouth. That move thrust the youngster's situation into the limelight once again in controversial fashion.",
      "Red Devils icon Giggs understands Mainoo's aspirations to play in the World Cup next summer in the United States. He feels a move in January could have little positive impact given the time required to settle at a new club.",
      "Giggs told BetSelect: “Every player wants to play in the World Cup and be on the pitch for their club. But if he goes on loan somewhere, he’s only got three or four months to really hit the ground running. What club has he gone to?",
      "“Is it a club that’s getting beaten every week, and it’s not doing him any favours? Or is it somewhere he’s going to be in and out of the team?”",
      "“He needs to make sure that when he gets his chance, he does well, especially around this time when the games come thick and fast,\" Giggs added. “I thought he did well the other night when he came on against Bournemouth. He just needs to take his chance, and anything can happen.",
      "“If he suddenly takes these opportunities and he’s playing regularly until the end of the season for Man United, that will give him more chance [at the England Squad] than going anywhere else.”",
      "Roy Keane similarly believes Mainoo must be patient. \"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months?,\" he said.",
      "\"He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer. He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",

    "body": [
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery insists he still has complete faith in Jadon Sancho's abilities and is committed to unlocking the winger's potential during the remainder of the campaign. The 25-year-old, who is on loan from Manchester United and will therefore be unavailable to face his parent club this weekend, has yet to make a Premier League start under Emery and hasn't found the net since arriving at Villa on deadline day.",
      "Sancho has, however, featured from the off in Villa's last four Europa League matches, though he is still awaiting his first assist for the club.",
      "Sancho has demonstrated glimpses of his talent when coming off the bench, particularly against Arsenal a fortnight ago, when he kept possession alive in the build-up to Emi Buendía's late winner.",
      "With the January transfer window looming, there has been talk that Villa might look to create room in their squad by terminating Sancho's loan early. However, Emery made his position on the winger crystal clear during his pre-United press conference.",
      "\"Jadon is still being young. He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance,\" the Villa boss said. \"I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us.",
      "\"Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him and hopefully we can get it.\"",
      "Villa are heading into their showdown with United on a winning streak, having triumphed in 15 of their last 17 matches, including nine straight victories, six of which were in the league - setting a new club record.",
      "However, United have historically held the upper hand against Villa, securing 41 Premier League victories against them, 18 of those away from home. Only the Red Devils themselves have defeated a single opponent more frequently, both overall and away, with 42 total wins and 19 away victories against Everton.",
      "When questioned if he had discussed Villa's poor track record against United with his team, Emery responded: \"I like usually to share with the players the numbers we have. Our own numbers and also Aston Villa's numbers, also with the trophies they got in the past.",
      "\"The players can analyse better, sometimes - not the moment we are in now - but how is the history for the team. Those numbers really mean a lot. We are facing on Sunday Manchester United ... and it is Manchester United!\".",
      "\"We must be motivated how we are now and how we are setting our objectives. We are third, but the reality is that we were at the bottom at the beginning.",
      "\"We are competing to be consistent in Europe and at the end of the season to try to get into a European position and also get trophies in different competitions.",
      "\"To be consistent and in the demands we are now, setting these demands every day higher, this is the way and the motivation we have.",
      "\"How we can achieve three points on Sunday? This is our motivation. Of course, we connect with our supporters at Villa Park fantastically, and the connection is the best quality we can have.",
      "\"There are lot things, individually and collectively, that give us confidence and motivation to help us get it again.\"",

      "United have climbed up to sixth in the top-flight table after a dismal beginning to the season, but they face a tall order when they travel to Villa Park. Unai Emery's squad have won their last nine games in all competitions.",
      "McTominay has thrived since leaving Old Trafford in 2024 for Napoli, having won a league title and been named Serie A's Most Valuable Player last year for his contributions.",
      "On Thursday evening, his side faced AC Milan in a crunch Supercoppa Italiana semi-final and they emerged as 2-0 victors thanks to goals from David Neres and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "But in the 81st minute, with Napoli 2-0 to the good a fight broke out. McTominay committed a foul in midfield and the referee blew the whistle. But as he did, the ball rolled towards ex-Chelsea star Fikayo Tomori.",
      "Tomori, with McTominay still running at him, booted the ball at the Scottish international. McTominay did not take kindly to this and squared up to Tomori, with team-mates flooding in to break the pair up.",
      "Words were exchanged and McTominay was furious. Both players received yellow cards for the altercation which mainly consisted of pushing and shouting and the game ended 2-0.",
      "If transfer rumours are to be believed then McTominay could soon be joined in Naples by young Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old has failed to break into Amorim's first-team plans and even made a loan request over the summer.",
      "Mainoo continues to ride the bench and has been surrounded by rumours linking him with a move away from Old Trafford come January. With McTominay and Hojlund currently on loan with Napoli, the Italian side have emerged as a potential suitor.",

      "Manchester United will be looking to return to winning ways when they face Aston Villa at Villa Park this afternoon.",
      "United have only lost one of their last 10 games but that run has seen them miss a whole host of glorious opportunities to climb further up the table. Monday was the latest missed chance to cut the gap between themselves and the Champions League spots, with Ruben Amorim's side throwing away a late lead to draw 4-4 in a chaotic game against Bournemouth.",
      "In terms of the team news, Casemiro is suspended for today's game and Kobbie Mainoo misses out after he picked up a small injury in training. Here are the starting line-ups for today's game:",
      "United: Lammens, Yoro, Heaven, Shaw, Dalot, Ugarte, Fernandes (c), Dorgu, Cunha, Sesko, Mount.",
      "Villa: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, Lindelof, Maatsen, Kamara, Onana, McGinn, Tielemans, Rogers, Watkins.",
      "Villa are the in-form team in the Premier League right and are third in the table, so today will be a huge test of Amorim's side.",
      "Stick with us for updates and reaction throughout the day.",
      "Fernandes picked up a knock a few minutes ago but he has continued.",
      "United got to be happy with how things are going here. They’ve kept Villa quiet for a while now and look the better side at the moment. Starting to show some control, good spells of possession, Cunha looking lively and the Villa Park faithful starting to get really rattled.",
      "Cunha won the ball back and forced a save from Martinez, shooting from the edge of the box.",
      "Two chances fall to Sesko in quick succession and he should do better. First one is a good save from Martinez, but elite strikers would want to be scoring that. Second is the wrong option, touch round the goalkeeper wasn’t on and should have looked to lift it. A promising sign that he is suddenly in the game, however.",
      "Villa made a fast start to this game, but they've dropped off and some of the fans around the press box are beginning to sound frustrated.",
      "Sesko latched onto a ball into the box and should have done a lot better.",
      "Mount offering some advice to Sesko during a break in play. Striker feeding on scraps at the moment, but he is at least offering an outball. Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",
      "Mount has just been shaking his head - he doesn't look happy with the speed United are playing at.",
      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence.",
      "Watkins found it far too easy against Yoro but that was impressive from Heaven, bailing his central defensive partner out. Watkins and Rogers are in great form for Villa and United will have their work cut out. That is a major confidence boost for the youngest member of the defence.",
      "Cunha has an early chance, but it flashes wide of the post.",
      "Not a surprise, but Dalot has started the game on the right side. The Portugal international has improved on the left in recent weeks. Dorgu is back in the starting side and is playing in his natural position.",
      "We're under way at Villa Park, so follow here for live updates throughout the game.",
      "We've had a lights show and some fire at Villa Park.",
      "We're just 10 minutes away from kick-off at Villa Park.",
      "The United boss spoke ahead of the game.",
      "When asked whether Mainoo would have started, Amorim said: “I prefer not to say, not just because of the player who is going to play this evening. Now it is easy to say… he knows, and that is enough.”",
      "Martinez back in goal for Villa after missing their last two games with a back injury. An interesting contrast with Lammens today. United had the pair on speed dial at the end of the transfer window as they weighed up which goalkeeper to go with. They went for potential and Lammens has started well enough, but Martinez has been excellent for Villa since the end of the transfer window. That’s impressive given he was waving goodbye to the fans in May ahead of an expected summer departure.",
      "Amorim wouldn’t give away whether Mainoo was due to start or not in his pre-match interviews. If there had been a late shift from a back four to a back three, then you would imagine Dorgu would be the player to come in, but I’m told the plan was always for the left wing-back to start. So maybe the back four stuff this week is all a bit of smoke and mirrors from Amorim.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park.",
      "The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "Maybe Amorim will fill us in on whether Mainoo would have started or not, but it did feel things were heading that way. You wonder if his injury has forced a rethink when it comes to the formation as well. Either way, that isn’t a particularly inspiring United XI and it’s an extremely thin bench. An uphill task arguably just got harder for United.",
      "No surprises with the starting team (excluding Mainoo’s absence). Amorim might have picked the same XI even if the 20-year-old had been in the squad today. Ugarte has been poor this season and he needs to step up. Villa will start the match with intensity and purpose, so Ugarte needs to be switched on from the first whistle. He has not kicked on since Amorim was appointed.",
      "Mainoo is absent from the squad today. United have said the youngster picked up a small injury in training, which ruled him out of this match. Stay tuned for quotes from Amorim when he speaks ahead of kick-off.",
      "XI | Lammens, Yoro, Heaven, Shaw, Dalot, Dorgu, Ugarte, Fernandes (c), Cunha, Sesko, Mount.",
      "Subs | Bayindir, Heaton, Fredricson, Malacia, Martinez, J. Fletcher, Lacey, Mantato, Zirkzee.",
      "We'll have the starting teams confirmed in just a moment.",
      "United were interested in signing two players they may come up against today: Martinez and Watkins. Martinez was considered as an alternative to Lammens, but a late agreement was reached to sign the Belgian international on transfer deadline day. Martinez would have brought personality and character to the dressing room, but United made the right decision to sign Lammens instead.",
      "Although Lammens should have done better for a few goals against Bournemouth, he has otherwise made a good start to life at United. Watkins also stayed in Birmingham. The 29-year-old has netted just three goals this season, and it looks like the right decision not to have paid a huge fee for him, so inevitably he’ll score today.",
      "United have pumped some cash into their data department since the Ineos takeover in a bid to make up lost ground on rivals who can mine the numbers much more efficiently than has been the case at Old Trafford. They are getting there now and if they study the numbers for this game, they would see a Villa side who sit third in the league but who are, by common consent, producing performances only worthy of a place in the bottom half. Are Villa doing something that the data is missing, aside from scoring worldies every week? Or will their performances regress to the mean? It’s going to be interesting to find out. If there is a manager capable of finding a way to make the data geeks look foolish, then it’s Emery, who is a master tactician and continues to do a remarkable job in the Midlands.",
      "The hosts are the marginal favourites.",
      "Villa vs United match odds",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "There will be a lot of focus on Mainoo today if he does start in midfield, but just as much should be reserved for Ugarte. It feels like the Uruguayan is drinking in the last chance saloon. His United career has been a constant disappointment since his £50.5million move from PSG and he’s been an unused sub in five of the last seven Premier League games. The other two have amounted to just 31 minutes of action. He will surely start in the absence of Casemiro and it feels like he has a lot to prove."

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Kobbie Mainoo to stay and \"fight for his job\" at Manchester United, telling the academy graduate to follow the example of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, who both had spells on the bench but knuckled down to fight for their Old Trafford futures.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season and could leave on loan next month, with Napoli at the head of a long list of suitors for his signature, but Amorim wants the academy graduate to stay and fight instead. Amorim took aim at the club legends telling Mainoo to leave on Friday and has now directed his message to the 20-year-old, who is frustrated at a lack of playing time at Old Trafford and is becoming a cause celebre among supporters, who are desperate to see one of their own playing more often.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" said Amorim. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing. I remember all the history of Manchester United and nobody. So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team win. To help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",
      "Amorim insisted he wasn't using Mainoo to make a point that big players must earn their stripes at Old Trafford and accept a spell on the bench, but that he must prove the head coach wrong when he gets a chance. Mainoo could earn a first league start of the season at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Amorim confirming he is considering a switch to a back four, which could offer Mainoo a route into the team as one of three midfielders.",
      "If he does get the chance, then Amorim urged the young midfielder to use his anger as fuel to show everyone what he can do. \"I’m not trying to say to Kobbie, 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something',\" he said.",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobbie sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, on Sunday, he is going to start.",

      "\"He’s a shy boy, but it's not his responsibility. He's responsible for his acts and his act was to play well in the last game, I'm just focused on that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I had the situation in Sporting (Lisbon) that my brother wrote something on the internet, and I have to answer for that. My explanation is that he has his life, he has his opinion, and it's nothing to do with me. So I will do the same with Kobbie.\"",

      "In addition to United, Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham are also interested in signing the 25-year-old. Amorim labelled Semenyo a \"special player\" before United's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday and saw first hand how dangerous he can be, with the Ghana international netting his seventh goal of the season.",

United have recently lost three players to the Africa Cup of Nations, but Amorim confirmed that there will be short-term moves next month and hinted that any deal could be in a position that isn't necessarily the top priority.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has a release clause in his contract that is reportedly valid for clubs outside of the Premier League.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder has been an integral figure for the Red Devils since his big-money arrival from Sporting CP in January 2020 for a little under £50million. He was named captain by former manager Erik ten Hag in 2023 and has so far amassed over 300 appearances for the club.",
      "This term, under Ruben Amorim, Fernandes has scored five goals and registered seven assists in his 17 appearances across all competitions. He is once again proving how integral he is to the side, but there is a scenario in which he would not be at the club this season had certain figures in United's hierarchy got their way in the summer.",
      "Earlier this month, Fernandes dropped a huge bombshell by revealing that some were trying to force him out of the club during the last transfer window following a substantial offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes rejected a significant salary in order to stay put at Old Trafford, with Amorim also eager to keep him at the club, despite a seemingly different view from higher up.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,\" he recently told Canal 11. \"I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad.",
      "\"I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.\"",
      "With the interview once again plunging Fernandes' long-term future at United into doubt, it has now emerged that the midfielder may have a release clause in his contract. That is according to journalist Fabrizio Romano, who says it can only be triggered by clubs abroad.",
      "\"There is a release clause in the contract of Bruno Fernandes,\" Romano explained in his latest YouTube video. \"And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only for clubs abroad. It is slightly over €60million (£52.5m).",
      "\"So, nothing is imminent. Nothing is happening. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on the interest from Saudi because I think from Saudi, they can return for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Then it’s going to be up to Bruno, up to Man Utd again. Let’s see what’s going to happen before or after the World Cup.\"",
      "In the meantime, United are preparing for Sunday's Premier League meeting against Aston Villa. A victory in the Midlands will take them level on 29 points with Liverpool and Chelsea.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire - two players so comfortable in the centre of a back three - are both injured providing a selection headache for Amorim. Those who are available look more suited to a 4-3-3 system and MEN Sport expects the Reds to revert to that today.",
      "Diogo Dalot will undoubtedly benefit from playing as a right-back again. The Portuguese defender tries valiantly to fit as a wing-back on both flanks but his strongest position is in a flat back four which should be used at Villa Park. Amorim will also be tempted to recall Lisandro Martinez to the team in the West Midlands considering the Argentine's experience.",
      "Ayden Heaven is certainly a star for the future and while this season has not reached the same heights as last year, it is way too early to write him off. That being said, Martinez will play alongside Leny Yoro if he is fit enough to play a full 90 minutes for the club.",
      "Another star almost guaranteed to feature in the clash with Villa is Manuel Ugarte. This is a half chance for the Uruguayan with Casemiro suspended but it would take a sensational performance for him to replace the Brazilian vs Newcastle.",
      "Alongside him in a three should be Kobbie Mainoo. Amorim spoke glowingly about the midfielder in his pre-match press conference despite his brother's t-shirt antics on Monday night. Mainoo will not be punished for what his brother did and rightly so. A start against Villa would be a show of confidence in the academy graduate over a pivotal festive period.",

Amorim railed against a sense of entitlement within the club, bemoaned the failure of anyone to knock on his door to air their frustrations and complained about the leadership group failing to take some issues off his hands.",
      "This was the day Amorim upped the ante with his squad. Perhaps Bruno Fernandes was one who emerged unscathed, described as a \"special character\" and an \"example\". How Amorim must wish he could clone his countryman.",
      "This felt like a calculated attack by Amorim. After 13 months in charge, he is still unhappy with what he is seeing, not necessarily on the pitch, but off it, and he is taking it upon himself to be the man who turns that around.",
      "\"Sometimes I am the first to say that I am failing this club inside the pitch, I have that feeling we are not performing the way we should,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Outside the pitch, I guarantee you I am not failing this club. I think it is something in our club. The players sometimes forget what it means to play for Manchester United. We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that is the feeling I have.\"",
      "This is the culture Amorim is railing against. His most brutal attack came when he was asked about the quickly deleted social media posts by Harry Amass and Chido Obi on Monday, as they took exception to their head coach's comments about their own struggles.",
      "Amorim insisted his comments shouldn't be seen as negative and twice used the word \"entitlement\" as he made a broader point about attitudes inside the club.",
      "\"I think it is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" he said. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words. Sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids. We don’t need to be always with accolades in everything, in every situation. We are not helping.\"",
      "A week ago, Amorim had told Kobbie Mainoo that his office door was always open and that if he wanted to leave in January, he should come and tell him. He told Amass and Chido that if they had an issue, they knew where to find him.",
      "Twice, Amorim repeated the idea that he was always available to his players, and his assertion that nobody was coming to see him felt like another dig; too many were happy to complain on social media or to friends and family, rather than going to their manager.",
      "There was also criticism of his six-man leadership group, which consists of Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martínez, and Tom Heaton.",
      "In the summer, Amorim said he wanted that group to deal with more dressing room issues and that they couldn't let everything fall on his shoulders. Five months later, nothing has changed.",
      "\"It continues a bit everything on my desk, every problem it is still me, but again my door is still open,\" he said.",
      "Amorim has always been an open and engaging communicator in press conferences. He talks freely and sometimes has a message to get across and isn't afraid to throw a few punches in the process.",
      "This week, most of those messages were aimed at his own squad. It's time to see how they respond, and whether the 40-year-old can be the man to end the entitlement he feels is holding Manchester United back.",

      "Manchester United face one of their toughest challenges in recent weeks this afternoon as they travel to Aston Villa in the Premier League. Unai Emery's side are on an exceptional run of form having won their last nine matches in all competitions and currently they sit seven points clear of the Reds.",
      "Ruben Amorim's task has been made even harder thanks to a handful of absences. In defence, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain out due to injury while Noussair Mazraoui is with the Morocco squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are also with their national teams for AFCON. Meanwhile, Casemiro picked up his fifth yellow card of the season on Monday night in the draw against Bournemouth and is suspended. He will be available for the Boxing Day clash against Newcastle.",
      "So with selection headaches galore for Amorim heading into the busy festive period, picking Sunday's team is by no means a foregone conclusion. Here is who our MEN Sport United writers think should be starting at Villa this weekend.",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Amorim has dropped another hint over a back four this week and it feels inevitable we are heading in that direction. I'd go that way at Villa, with Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw the full-backs, which allows Lisandro Martinez to return alongside Leny Yoro in defence.",
      "In midfield, Ugarte has to come in for Casemiro, but three players in there should mean a first Premier League start for Kobbie Mainoo, who has to take the chance to impress. Bruno Fernandes will round off that trio.",
      "Benjamin Sesko should be fit enough to lead the line now, with Matheus Cunha coming in off the left. Right-wing is a bit of a problem, but Mason Mount has the intelligence to play there and his form makes him worthy of a start.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "It is a bit of a risk considering the players available to Amorim this weekend but I would be tempted to stick with a back three at Villa Park. Ayden Heaven has looked shaky against better opposition which is why recalling Martinez to play the slightly unfamiliar role at the centre of the back three makes sense.",
      "Dalot should benefit from playing on his preferred right while it would be a big chance for Patrick Dorgu to show he can offer a good option on the left. Sticking with 3-4-2-1 means there would be no place for Mainoo in the starting XI as Ugarte has to replace Casemiro.",
      "Up front, a three of Mount, Cunha and Sesko is an exciting prospect especially if the latter two's form can step up a notch in the absence of Mbeumo.",

      "Ryan Giggs has urged Kobbie Mainoo to stay at Manchester United, despite Alan Shearer and Nicky Butt suggesting the youngster should look elsewhere for regular game time. Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League match this season and has made 11 substitute appearances under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Monday's 4-4 home draw with Bournemouth saw Mainoo come off the bench to a warm reception from the Old Trafford crowd. His lack of regular minutes has fuelled growing speculation about his future, with the January transfer window set to open next month.",
      "Chelsea, West Ham and Napoli are among the clubs credited with an interest in signing Mainoo in recent weeks, although reports suggest United have no intention of letting the midfielder leave Old Trafford in January despite the speculation.",
      "Giggs, meanwhile, believes the 20‑year‑old should remain patient and take his chances when he's given them. \"I can see where the lads [Scholes and Butt] are coming from,\" the Reds' icon told betting comparison site BetSelect.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United. It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult. We all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "Giggs continued: \"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I'd like to see him stay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Shearer has previously explained why it might be in Mainoo's best interest to leave United and why a move could also benefit the Reds. \"Clearly the manager doesn't fancy Kobbie Mainoo,\" the Newcastle United icon said.",
      "\"Because if you can't get into a team when they're really struggling, then there's an issue. And I guess it looks from the outside as if a move would be better off for all parties.",
      "\"This is not the first time we've seen that Manchester United players are not fitting into what the manager wants.",
      "\"And he hasn't been afraid to get rid of them or let them go out on loan or sell them. And that looks as if it's going to be the case for him. I don't know, I'm not inside the club, I don't know what his attitude's like.",
      "\"But I guess looking from the outside, then it would be best for both parties if he could get out and play some football in January and onwards. Whether that's on loan or whether that's a permanent deal, then we'll have to wait and see.",
      "\"But clearly, if you're not playing, you have to look at the situation and get out.\"",
      "Butt, who shares the same view, said: \"For his football career, he has to leave Manchester United. He's lost 18 months of development.",
      "\"I hope he goes abroad because it is embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea which they might go and get him, they are putting together a very young squad.\"",

      "As Manchester United sought to add a goalkeeper to their squad in the closing days and hours of the summer transfer window, they had two No.1s waiting by the phone ready to receive the call. United's transfer executives were weighing up moves for Senne Lammens and Emiliano Martinez, two goalkeepers at very different stages of their careers.",
      "Lammens, 23, had never played outside of Belgium and had fewer than 100 games under his belt at this stage, of which only 68 had been in the top division. Martinez was a World Cup winner, a two-time winner of the Yashin Trophy for the world's best goalkeeper and had 250 Premier League games under his belt. He might have been about to turn 33, but he still had plenty to offer.",
      "In the end, United's transfer pivot towards youth and data won the battle. Lammens arrived as United's most inexperienced first-choice goalkeeper for a long time. He has had a solid start to his Old Trafford career, if not spectacular, and didn't have a great game against Bournemouth on Monday.",
      "But there is clear potential there. Lammens is a calm goalkeeper who always looks unflustered. His kicking has been secure and he has spread confidence through the defence thanks to his serenity, something that had been lacking in recent seasons.",
      "Martinez had set his heart on a move to United. He had tears in his eyes as he waved to the Villa fans at the end of last season in a move that seemed to signal he would be on his way in the summer. Even on deadline day, a switch to Old Trafford looked a possibility.",
      "For whatever reason, it never materialised. Marco Bizot began the season in goal for Villa, but when Martinez stayed, Unai Emery brought him back in, and he has once again been outstanding at Villa Park, a key figure in what is an unlikely push to enter the title race throughout the first half of the season.",
      "Villa will certainly be the favourites on Sunday. They have won nine in a row in all competitions and 15 of their last 17 games, a remarkable run of form that has propelled them into contention after a disappointing start. You would expect Lammens to be the busier goalkeeper.",
      "That's if Martinez even makes it. He has missed the last two games due to a back injury, and given the possibility of him having another strong performance to deny the club that considered signing him just four months ago, it might be easier for Ruben Amorim if he is unavailable.",
      "It's far too early to judge the success or otherwise of Lammens, who is clearly a goalkeeper still learning his trade. If United had made their decision based on the goalkeeper likely to be a better performer this season, then they would have gone for Martinez. However, under Ineos, there has been a shift towards long-term thinking.",
      "When United signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp for £21.7million, director of football Jason Wilcox highlighted his \"potential\" and after making his debut, Amorim admitted to being surprised by the impact the young goalkeeper had made. His rock-solid debut against Sunderland earned him those comparisons with Peter Schmeichel from the Stretford End.",
      "It was never going to be an entirely smooth journey for Lammens, however, and there is maybe just the hint of a question or two being asked now, although he clearly remains United's best option in goal. The alternative was to sign someone else, and that someone else could well be at the opposite end of the pitch this weekend.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville has had his say on discussions surrounding a change of formation in the side's 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Kobbie Mainoo to force his way into the Manchester United team, rather than exploring other opportunities amid ongoing speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo's future at United has been the subject of debate since the summer. The England international asked to leave the club on loan towards the end of the transfer window, but United didn't sanction the move.",
      "The 20-year-old has played just 11 Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this season, all coming off the bench. His only start in this campaign came in the EFL Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town in August.",
      "Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, sparked controversy for wearing a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth. Mainoo came on with under 30 minutes left, his third-longest runout in the league this season, in a thriller at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo-Hames posted the image on his Instagram page, and it has led to more questions about the midfielder's future and attitude. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane labelled the stunt idiotic and urged Mainoo to work to get into the squad.",
      "\"Are you telling me that he can't sit there for another six months? He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane added on Mainoo's future at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\"",
      "Despite the noise around Mainoo, Amorim has refused to say whether a loan moan would be sanctioned. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

      "Many United fans will be wondering when their three stars could return. Morocco are tipped to clinch their first Afcon title since 1976, as per a new AFCON Supercomputer prediction.",
      "The forecast by AFCON betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com suggests that the host nation will triumph over Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. That would mean that United and Morocco's Mazraoui won't be available for Reds boss Ruben Amorim until an away clash against Arsenal on January 25.",

However, he would still not be available for the Manchester derby on January 17 as that date falls on the third-placed playoff - which Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",

      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's famous brother made a bold statement against Ruben Amorim by donning a controversial T-shirt at Manchester United's Premier League match against Bournemouth – marking yet another instance of the midfielder's celebrity sibling stirring things up at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo has found himself out of favour with manager Amorim amidst speculation of a possible departure in January. The England international has been absent from the starting eleven for all of United's 16 league games this season, his only start being in the Red Devils' humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "The 20-year-old appeared to have the world at his feet following a standout 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, during which he netted the decisive goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and became an integral part of the England team that reached the Euros final.",
      "However, since Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, things have taken a turn for the worse for the Stockport-born academy product, with United icon Paul Scholes among those advising Mainoo to leave his childhood club in pursuit of more playing time. Reports suggest that Mainoo was eager to move to Napoli over the summer but had his request denied.",
      "Despite his limited game time, the young player received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he came on for Casemiro just after the hour mark during United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. However, post-match attention swiftly shifted to a provocative comment made by his brother at the side of the pitch.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was spotted in the front row sporting a black T-shirt bearing the message \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", a move with the potential to exacerbate an already tense situation. The act has divided United's fanbase, with some accusing Mainoo's relative of unnecessary provocation, while others see it as a legitimate protest.",
      "Mainoo's elder sibling may be a familiar face to many – the fashion model and influencer featured on the 2019 series of popular reality TV show Love Island and has since garnered over 680,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "His name will also resonate within Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo disclosed that his brother's time on Love Island had resulted in him being given an unusual moniker.",
      "He stated: \"My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me 'Love Island'. He's been doing so since I was like 16.\"",

    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Injuries and suspensions have forced Ruben Amorim to give last chances to three Manchester United stars against Aston Villa.",
      "Amorim‘s side have improved this season, though their lack of consistency has prevented them from taking control in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "Man Utd will move back above Liverpool and into fifth in the Premier League if they beat Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon, though this will be far from easy.",
      "This is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Aston Villa are the form team in the Premier League as they have emerged as credible challenges for the title.",
      "Also, Man Utd are low on numbers for this game, with Amorim resorting to giving final chances to three under-fire players.",

      "As was the case in the summer, INEOS could make sales to raise funds for signings in priority positions, including centre-midfield, wing-back and centre-back.",
      "This means a few Man Utd players are fighting for their futures at Old Trafford, with this particularly the case with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The £42m signing has proven a huge disappointment at Man Utd and has even struggled under Amorim, who worked with the midfielder at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "This has seen Ugarte being reduced to a bit-part player this season, with reports claiming the club are planning to ‘sacrifice’ him in January to fund other deals.",
      "To avoid this from happening, Ugarte really needs to take his rare opportunity from the start against Aston Villa, with Casemiro’s one-game suspension and Kobbie Mainoo’s slight injury forcing Amorim to start him alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Man Utd could have no other option but to cut ties with Ugarte if his struggles continue against Aston Villa, with Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu in a similar boat.",
      "Shaw should be a good fit for Amorim’s system due to his ability to operate in various positions, but his best days are clearly behind him as he has been a real weak link in Man Utd’s defence this term.",
      "This has fuelled heavy criticism, but he remains in Man Utd’s starting XI as Lisandro Martinez builds match fitness, with a return to form needed to prevent the World Cup winner from taking his place.",
      "Regarding Dorgu, Man Utd are said to have ‘doubts’ about the wing-back, who is clearly raw and has struggled following his £29m move from Lecce in January.",
      "Amad Diallo’s absence due to the African Cup of Nations means Dorgu starts against Aston Villa as Diogo Dalot moves to the right, with his performance this afternoon to have a role in determining his standing at Man Utd heading into next year.",
      "Man Utd’s XI vs Aston Villa is as follows: Lammens, Dalot, Yoro, Heaven, Shaw, Dorgu, Ugarte, Fernandes, Cunha, Mount, Sesko.",

      "Solskjaer only signed a new three-year contract a few months before but five defeats in seven Premier League matches saw the pressure build on the Norwegian.",
      "An embarrassing 4-1 loss to Watford was the final straw but, despite some encouraging early results, Man Utd hardly fared any better under Rangnick.",
      "Man Utd finished second and third in the Premier League during Solskjaer’s time at Old Trafford, while they went on a run to the Europa League final in May 2021.",

      "“I think Ole deserved more time – and when I say Ole, I also want to mention his staff, like Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. They were going the right way to bring United back.",
      "“Of course, they made the decision to sack Ole based on his final couple of results, but he was an amazing person with the right profile for the club. He and his assistants understood football – training was perfect and had every little detail ready for us.",
      "“I felt sorry because Ole was a great guy and we were on the way to doing something big. I wasn’t his first choice in the midfield and never liked a coach when I didn’t play – I’d fight with them.",
      "“But Ole was the first coach I didn’t fight with. He brought the players who weren’t in the starting XI together. He knew the club and the fans loved him.”",
      "Solskjaer revealed last year that Man Utd failed to act on his recommendation to sign Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice in a three-man shortlist.",
      "Speaking to the Stick To Football podcast, Solskjaer said: “Erling was with me at Molde for two seasons, more or less. The summer before I came, I rang the club and said: ‘You have to sign this boy, he is going to be absolutely top class.’ That was in June or July and they said they didn’t have enough reports.",
      "“By the time I came in as caretaker, we [Molde] had sold him to Salzburg. I tell the club straight away: ‘Buy him.’ He had a release clause. No-one else then would have paid that money. It was 20m euros and it would have been a bargain. It was the club’s decision to not go for him then.",
      "“We didn’t go for him until he started scoring for Salzburg but then Dortmund, Juventus, everyone was there.”",
      "On Bellingham, Solskjaer added: “We had Jude in the building.",
      "“We sold the club to him as best we could but he wanted X amount of minutes. He is the most mature 17-year-old I ever met in my life.”",
      "Vitor Pereira has been sacked by rock-bottom Wolves, who are winless in ten Premier League games. And it’s becoming a very interesting top 10 to replace him…",

      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves, but derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of three consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re definitely less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",

      "In the interview, the Man Utd midfielder said: “Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be. I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",

      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”",
      "That has raised the possibility of a move in January for Fernandes and Romano has revealed that he has a release clause in his contract at Man Utd for €60m for non-Premier League sides.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that “more than ten” clubs are looking to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano says “keep an eye on Saudi interest” in Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd have “made contact” in the last 48 hours over a deal to sign Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants."

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Chelsea) – £45m",
      "5th (Liverpool) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Sunderland) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Manchester United) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Crystal Palace) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Brighton) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Everton) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Newcastle) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Spurs) – £21.2m",

      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (22 games) – worth around £18.5m",
      "=8th) Chelsea and Liverpool (21 games) – worth around £17.8m",
      "10th) Leeds (19 games) – worth around £16.2m",

      "20th) Burnley (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "",
      "While it will vary due to inflation, fluctuating operating costs and other mitigating factors, it is possible to estimate how much total prize money each Premier League team will be paid in 2025/26 based on the payments made in 2024/25.",
      "1) Arsenal – £71.6m",

      "Ryan Giggs feels there is a “massive plus” at Manchester United despite the club losing some of their key players to the African Cup of Nations in December.",
      "United played their last game with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in the squad for a while, in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday. Noussair Mazraoui was not even able to play that, with Morocco not allowing the Red Devils to pick him in the squad.",
      "The aforementioned trio have left for AFCON, with the earliest date they are likely to return the beginning of January, as the group stages end on the final day of December.",
      "Mbeumo has been one of United’s very best players this term, and the other absent players have also been of use.",
      "As such, the seventh-placed Premier League club will be somewhat worried about their fixtures without the trio, given there are a couple of tough tasks in their next two games: Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "United legend Giggs feels there’s cause for optimism despite losing three top players, though.",
      "“[Benjamin] Sesko is now back, which helps. But it’s definitely going to be a blow because Mbeumo has probably been the best player so far this season and looks like a real threat. Plays every game, has power, scores goals, and Amad can make things happen. So yeah, it’s going to be tough.",
      "“But with Sesko coming back, [Matheus] Cunha could drop back into where Mbeumo was playing. Amad will be difficult to replace, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it, whether we are going to change shape.",
      "“I’m not too sure. But those two lads [Mbeumo and Amad] are definitely going to be missed. And I think United fans are just hoping that their countries don’t go through the group stage, and we don’t miss them for too long.",
      "“The plus side is that Mason Mount has come back into the team. And that’s a massive plus. You never know how good a player is until they’re playing regularly.",
      "“And now we’re starting to see the Mason Mount that we’ve seen at Chelsea for a number of years. He’s a good, clever player. All the coaches like him. When you’re a manager, you want players you can trust, and he looks like someone you can really trust.”",

      "Each of the aforementioned clubs are said to be closely monitoring Adams, per Caught Offside, and the Blues’ connection could spell trouble for other interested clubs.",

      "It’s evident that Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are the favoured midfield pair, and Mainoo knows he’s never going to displace the former.",

      "He told Metro: “I can see where the lads [Scholes and Butt] are coming from.",
      "“As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United. It’s like a striker. You don’t see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "“We all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient. He’s still young, he’s still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",

      "Every summer, as soon as the last competitive ball is kicked, football turns into a glossy travelling circus. Clubs criss-cross the globe in search of broadcast exposure, commercial partnerships and, increasingly, the kind of international branding that even mega-corps like Amazon and Google might think was a bit much.",
      "The modern pre-season tour has become a pillar of elite football’s economy. Yet as the miles stretch further, the environmental cost grows heavier. The contradiction is now impossible to ignore: the sport’s most aggressively globalised tradition is also one of its biggest carbon headaches.",
      "The distances involved are staggering. Manchester United‘s 2023 tour, for example, included stops in Edinburgh, Oslo, New Jersey, San Diego, Houston and Las Vegas. According to publicly available flight data for comparable routes, such a journey easily exceeds 20,000 kilometres of air travel. Long-haul flights remain one of football’s most carbon-intensive activities, with aviation consistently identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a major emissions source.",
      "Find out where your team ranks in the Pledgeball table!",
      "United are hardly alone. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool regularly venture to the United States. Spurs and Newcastle visited Australia barely minutes after the 2023-24 season finished, a single trip that – based on standard aviation emissions calculations for London-Melbourne return flights – produced several tonnes of CO₂ per person, before factoring in staff, equipment and internal travel.",
      "Clubs argue, often fairly, that these tours are commercial imperatives. The Premier League’s overseas broadcasting deals now dwarf domestic packages and international fan engagement translates directly into revenue. There is also a strategic logic: the United States and Southeast Asia are enormous growth markets. As long as sponsors and rights-holders prioritise global visibility, clubs will feel compelled to keep hopping across continents. Put simply, the machine pays too well to slow down.",
      "But the climate reality is moving faster than football’s commercial model. The United Nations Environment Programme has repeatedly highlighted the disproportionate emissions from international sport travel, while UEFA and FIFA’s own sustainability reports acknowledge travel as the single largest contributor to tournament footprints. The contradiction is baked into the structure of elite football. Clubs publicly commit to net-zero strategies, yet continue participating in a pre-season system designed to maximise miles, not minimise emissions.",
      "Some clubs are beginning to take tentative steps toward a different model. Brighton & Hove Albion have opted for more Europe-based pre-seasons in recent years, reducing long-haul flights while still accessing competitive opponents. Brentford have explored hybrid approaches, mixing local training camps with short-haul travel. FC Copenhagen, one of the more progressive clubs in Scandinavia, have publicly discussed avoiding unnecessary long-distance travel outside major competitions. These decisions are often framed as performance-oriented – shorter travel equals better recovery – but the environmental benefits are obvious.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "A handful of clubs have experimented with centralised training hubs, a concept borrowed from American sports. Instead of flying from city to city for friendlies, teams gather in a single region or country, reducing the number of long-haul flights required. It is not a perfect solution, but it is measurably better than zig-zagging across continents. Another emerging idea is the “festival” model: several clubs gathering in one location for a mini-tournament, cutting down on both miles and logistical complexity. The Premier League Summer Series in the United States has even inadvertently demonstrated this, grouping fixtures within a relatively contained region to reduce internal travel.",
      "The conversation is also shifting at governing-body level. UEFA’s 2030 environmental strategy stresses travel reduction and more efficient scheduling, though it stops short of regulating club tours. FIFA have commissioned sustainability studies for the expanded Club World Cup, which itself required enormous global travel. For all the talk of responsibility, binding restrictions remain rare. Football seldom limits what boosts revenue.",
      "The science, however, is unequivocal. Aviation emissions are among the most damaging forms of climate impact and long-haul flights generate significantly more CO₂ per passenger-kilometre than most other forms of transport. While clubs often offset flights through tree-planting schemes or certified credits, many climate researchers argue that offsets cannot substitute genuine emissions reductions. The most effective solution remains the simplest: fly less.",
      "This is where football’s commercial priorities clash with its environmental aspirations. Clubs promote recycled kits, solar panels, electric mowers and waste-reduction drives – programmes that are valuable, genuine and necessary. But none of them match the scale of emissions produced by a two-week global tour involving tens of thousands of kilometres in the air. It is the sustainability equivalent of bragging about reusable water bottles while taking a private jet to work.",
      "Still, this issue is not unsolvable. Football has reinvented itself before, sometimes dramatically, when commercial logic demanded it. The same machinery that built pre-season tours into a global brand vehicle could just as easily retool them into a lower-carbon model – if governing bodies, sponsors and clubs decide the reputational upside is worth it. As climate expectations tighten across every sector, that moment may be coming sooner than football anticipates.",
      "Until then, the sport’s most glamorous summer ritual remains one of its dirtiest secrets. The crowds, the content and the commercial gains will continue, but the climate cost will grow heavier each year.",
      "In an era when football increasingly markets itself as a vehicle for social betterment, its love affair with long-haul summer travel remains the one area in which the industry most clearly refuses to look in the mirror.",
      "To learn more about Pledgeball and how you can pledge to help your club shoot up the sustainability standings, visit Pledgeball.org.",
      "The Mailbox insists Arsenal have become ‘terrible to watch, attritional and boring’ under Mikel Arteta this season despite being top of the Premier League.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…",
      "Mikel Arteta must be thrilled that his Arsenal players can time their shows of ‘unprofessionalism’ but also solidarity with struggling teammates so well.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",

      "In the winter, there is typically an equal amount of noise, but not nearly as much action, with the window often descending into a snore-fest.",
      "This could easily be the case next month, but there are at least a few fascinating topics to be settled as Antoine Semenyo is among those at the heart of the conversation.",
      "If Erling Haaland was not performing at such an unbeatable level, Semenyo would be considered a serious contender for Player of the Season in the Premier League at this point in the campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has been great for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to a new level this term with ten goal involvements in 15 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "READ: Maresca ‘shock’ development, Amorim’s ‘handbrake’ problem and ‘woke’ Lineker’s incredible ‘revenge’ plan",
      "This is bittersweet for Bournemouth as they have reaped the rewards of his stellar performances this term, but it also means that he will soon be playing his football elsewhere.",
      "This is especially the case because Semenyo has a reasonable £65m release clause in his current contract, which reportedly becomes active for a brief time in January.",
      "And the intense competition for his services is another reason why an exit next month already feels pretty inevitable, with several outlets naming Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur as the clubs vying for his signature.",
      "For the reasons mentioned above, this level of interest in Semenyo is hardly surprising, and on current form, he would immediately go into the starting XI of these teams upon joining.",
      "But which of these five teams will win the race to acquire Semenyo next month? And possibly more importantly, what will the four rejected sides do instead?",
      "Well, starting with Semenyo, each of these clubs has been leading the race to sign him at some stage over the last month, but that is obviously not the reality.",
      "Instead, the truth is in what was initially reported about Semenyo before Arsenal, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs seemingly came charging in, with this perhaps a case of the player’s agent engineering a bidding war by feeding false updates to the media.",
      "You perceptive readers will notice that Liverpool are not mentioned in the previous line; this is because they remain, as they always have been, the likely winner to sign Semenyo.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n* Big Weekend: Tottenham v Liverpool, Aston Villa, Martin Odegaard, Enzo Maresca\n* Transfer power ranking: Guehi, Baleba, Anderson among non-Big Six stars most likely to leave in 2026\n* Five-year net spend table sees Man Utd top ahead of January transfer window",
      "This is not only because The Guardian’s Jamie Jackson has reported that the winger ‘favours’ Liverpool. A move to Anfield just makes the most sense.",
      "Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes, formerly of Bournemouth, has a relationship with Semenyo and already helped the Premier League giants sign former teammate Milos Kerkez in the summer.",
      "The Reds are well-stocked up front with Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, but they are nowhere near as strong in wide positions, and this situation has been made worse by Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo’s disappointing form.",
      "Semenyo certainly fits the Liverpool mould for what they want from wingers, and he is also capable of playing on either flank.",
      "This signing would be a significant boost for Liverpool, especially if Salah leaves, but the centre-back department remains a more pressing concern for Slot due to a lack of options and the declines suffered by Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Marc Guehi, as he was in the summer, is the most obvious fix to this problem, but Liverpool could suffer more disappointment regarding this transfer in the winter.",
      "After Liverpool messed around in the summer, the world is Guehi’s oyster, so he would be foolish to accept a move in January and give up a potentially massive signing-on fee at the end of the season. So they will likely have to settle for Semenyo as their only marquee signing in the winter, which is not to be sniffed at.",
      "As for the other clubs, there have been murmurs about Arsenal doing a bit of business to ease their injury issues, though this “problem” cannot be used as an excuse for potentially another failed Premier League title challenge.",
      "This is also the case because it seems like there will be no notable departees as Mikel Arteta slams the exit door shut, preventing Gabriel Jesus, Ethan Nwaneri, Myles Lewis-Skelly and co. from moving for more game time.",
      "So with Arsenal already having the most complete squad in the Premier League, they have no real need to enter the market in January and surely won’t unless their injury issues suddenly worsen.",
      "Man City, too, are unlikely to do anything regarding incomings, though they are probably second to Liverpool in the running for Semenyo.",
      "Semenyo would obviously be a great addition, but they already have Jeremy Doku in Semenyo’s natural position. His performances have ranged from good to exceptional this season, so they are covered.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "But unlike City and Arsenal, Spurs are in a far weaker position with their options in the final third.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side are said to be pulling out all of the stops to sign Semenyo, but this will likely ultimately fail to sign the winger.",
      "Instead, as David Ornstein has mentioned, it is foreseeable that they return for Man City star Savinho as an alternative after targeting him in the summer, with the winger currently only a bit-part player at the Etihad.",
      "And finally, Manchester United’s supposed interest is not a shock as they lingered in the summer before signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha instead of spending £80m on Semenyo.",
      "Man Utd certainly could do with Semenyo as they are already too reliant on Mbeumo and Cunha, but Liverpool are ahead of their rivals in the pecking order for good reason.",
      "So with Semenyo likely heading elsewhere, Man Utd’s window should be more low-key, with potentially only one in and one out.",
      "This would be in the midfield department, with a loan for Kobbie Mainoo said to be dependent on Man Utd signing a replacement, who will be a Conor Gallagher or a Ruben Neves, before getting their chequebook out for Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and/or Adam Wharton in the summer.",
      "Now, feel free to hibernate for the entire January transfer window, because you already know which transfers will and won’t happen involving five of the Big Six. You’re welcome…",

      "Courtesy of WhoScored’s average match ratings, here is the worst player at each Premier League club in this season.",
      "We can’t be saying some bench fodder is a club’s worst player, so you can only qualify if you’ve started at least six games this season.",
      "Liverpool’s is a summer signing, Arsenal’s is a surprise, and Brighton’s is still reeling after not getting his big move. Here goes nothing…",
      "",
      "Premier League leaders Arsenal can’t look at a single player and say: ‘You must improve.’ Maybe Ebere Eze? When he isn’t soaked in North London Derby narrative, he’s not really been that great.",
      "But he’s not Arsenal’s player. Raya is Arsenal’s player. This is despite him leading the Premier League Golden Glove race. Maybe you lose points for slamming the ground like a child. Who knows how the algorithm works?",

      "Signed from Nice for £26million in the summer, Guessand has zero goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances for Villa.",
      "",
      "Smith was Bournemouth’s representative throughout most of last season. We said they had to sign a new right-back, but then they had to sign a new centre-back. And then a left-back. And then another centre-back. So then a new right-back became an afterthought.",
      "Andoni Iraola did sign Alex Jimenez, but he’s only 20 years old, so Smith has been called upon frequently this campaign. Sharing the right-back load is probably the way to go.",
      "",
      "With only two goals in 14 games, Jensen is playing more regularly than he was at the start of the campaign and remains a crucial player in the Brentford squad.",
      "",
      "His failed transfer to Manchester United has clearly had a detrimental effect on Baleba’s form, and he is playing his way out of his dream move.",
      "There’s no doubt that Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are now favoured by the United hierarchy. It’s time to get your s**t together, son.",
      "",
      "After looking like they’d be competitive all season, Burnley have just gone off the boil a bit. We’re suddenly fearful that the Clarets and Wolves will continue to fade away and the relegation battle will be a lot less exciting than initially expected.",
      "",
      "In exactly six Premier League starts, Delap hasn’t registered a goal or assist for Chelsea. He’s now out for around six weeks and won’t be the Blues’ representative here much longer, because six starts soon won’t be enough to merit an inclusion.",
      "",
      "This feels harsh. But a 6.68 average rating doesn’t feel wrong for Henderson. Palace have just been that good this season.",
      "",
      "It’s hardly surprising that Barry – who didn’t register a shot on target until his 14th Everton appearance and only scored his first goal on matchday 15 – is Everton’s worst player in 2025/26.",

      "King’s average rating might be a bit pants but he’s still shown plenty of promise this season.",
      "",
      "After joining last summer, Perri didn’t get off to the best start, nor the worst. Then he got injured. And because his start to life at Leeds was so meh, Daniel Farke felt no need to rush him back, putting his faith in Karl Darlow. And now Perri is playing again, but conceding a whole heap of goals.",
      "",
      "Almost any player would’ve been funny, but Isak might be the funniest option of all. The Mo Salah narrative is already so strong that we are fine with it not being him. Florian Wirtz has been awful, Alisson is conceding goals for fun, and Milos Kerkez is really struggling. But the floppiest flop in Premier League flopsville is a beauty, really.",
      "The most expensive player in Premier League history has one goal and one assist (which was an accident) in eight league appearances for Liverpool. He’s looked off the pace since minute one. All after the biggest saga of the summer transfer window and burning all of his bridges with Newcastle United. It isn’t easy to have any sympathy.",
      "",
      "City legend Silva is still someone Pep Guardiola heavily relies on, starting 11 times in the Premier League and featuring in all 15 matches. He’s not been amazing by any stretch, but a 6.63 isn’t that bad.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim enjoys changing his centre-backs in every game, which can be detrimental to one’s match rating. Yoro has played in all 16 of United’s league matches this term, starting 10 times.",
      "",
      "We’re hardly surprised by Elanga’s inclusion. For £55million, his output has been nowhere near good enough. His end product has lacked all season, and Jacob Murphy might have already usurped him in Eddie Howe’s pecking order.",
      "",
      "Wood hasn’t played since October 18 but was pretty rubbish up to that point. He scored a brace against Brentford on matchday one but those are his only two goals in eight Premier League matches. At this point last season, he had 10 goals and Forest were fourth in the table.",
      "",
      "Sunderland have been the Premier League’s surprise package this season, making the inclusion of any player feel harsh, but it has to be someone. And that someone is young Belgian attacker Talbi.",

      "Jeez. Only one player? Wolves, as a collective, have been an abomination this season. We’ll hardly be pinning it all on Hwang.",
      "Relegation is pretty much guaranteed for a club with two points from 16 Premier League games. And they’re being let down by two of their better players, with Andre and Jorgen Strand Larsen (both 6.28) both massively underperforming as well.",
      "Andre’s error for Manchester United’s opening goal at Molineux on Monday was both calamitous and hilarious, contributing to one of the worst goals of all time.",
      "Not one Wolves player can hold their head up right now. It’s been pathetic all across the board. Though there is an argument that they’ve been massively let down by the ownership, who didn’t have a good summer transfer window. And now Andre and Strand Larsen are tanking their value. Ideal."

      "Despite this, INEOS opted to back Amorim in the summer and they have improved during the first half of this campaign.",
      "Amorim has made tactical tweaks to adjust his system to get the best out of his players, while they have also been helped by their positive business in the summer.",
      "Man Utd made four statement signings in the summer, landing Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for around £230m combined.",
      "The Red Devils also did well to offload most of their dead wood, but they still have plenty of improvements to make, especially in midfield.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings as Tottenham plummet and Villa soar",
      "Now, Ferguson has explained why it could take “ten years” for Man Utd to win the Premier League again.",
      "“He [Amorim] is a good personality. It is not easy,” Ferguson said in an interview for Press Box.",
      "“I remember looking back on my own time there, starting off when Liverpool were the bee’s knees.",
      "“They were a fantastic club winning the European Cup four times and all that, but then it took them 31 years to win the league again.",
      "“We are now in the same situation. It could be ten years, could be 11 years, because of that cycle.",
      "“It has to be thought out carefully and we have to make sure the recruitment is going to be better than what it was.”",
      "Despite this, Ferguson has been pleased with Man Utd’s summer transfer business.",
      "Interestingly, Ferguson did not mention Sesko as he has made a slow start to this campaign, but he thinks Lammens has “made a difference” for this new team this term.",
      "“I think the appointment of the goalkeeper [Senne Lammens] has made a difference,” Ferguson added.",
      "“He’s young at 23, he’s quick, a big lad, good feet and hands, and I think that helps. I think they have needed that player. United have always had inspirational players over the years. I think that has helped.",

      "Plus the original Athletic story was only that Maresca ‘is high among the candidates’ and ‘expected to figure prominently…although he would not be the only contender’ to replace Guardiola in ‘contingency planning’ for if the Spaniard leaves the Etihad at the end of this season.",

      "Sunday 21 December 2025 07:03, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows called EVERY match result correct on Saturday, going eight from eight with the accumulator paying 1,200/1 - can he stay perfect?",
      "This one is primed for chaos.",
      "Both teams rank inside the top four for xG created per 90 when trailing in a match. It's where Villa are actually thriving when it comes to the data.",
      "What this tells us is that if the scoreline changes early, the match won't settle. It'll stretch, open up, and turn into an end-to-end spectacle with two dangerous attacks.",
      "Villa have taken 15 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League side. That's not luck. That's mentality, style and intent.",
      "When they fall behind, they double down on attacking patterns rather than protecting themselves. At Villa Park, that philosophy is heightened, too. Against a Manchester United side that have averaged 3.5 total goals per game this season and one that also thrives in broken, transitional games, that points towards this being a potential banger.",
      "Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is a winner in waiting.",
      "Marco Silva looked crestfallen watching Fulham being knocked out of the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "Another chance to challenge for a trophy came and went. And the harsh reality for Fulham is that Silva, who is out of contract in the summer, has probably outgrown them now. He's a very ambitious coach.",
      "Ask yourself this: would you rather keep Fulham in mid-table season after season or potentially go take a job where challenging for honours and playing in Europe is on the radar? Silva has earned a crack at that.",
      "And with uncertainty growing about his situation, that could spell trouble for Fulham over the next six months or so. A club that are famed for downing tools when safe in mid-table, that regression may come sooner.",
      "In contrast, there's a freshness and enthusiasm in the way Nottingham Forest are playing now under Sean Dyche. With Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic back as a pair, a surge up the table is expected. Forest draw no bet at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a tasty wager.",
      "Newcastle's injury crisis has had a huge influence on this market where Chelsea are now favourites at 29/20 with Sky Bet. It's a price which looks skinny to me but the team news angle still is a betting proposition as whoever fills in at right-back for Newcastle is going to be under serious pressure if Alejandro Garnacho starts.",
      "All signs suggest Lewis Miley is set to deputise on that side and at 5/1 with Sky Bet to be booked, that's a price that simply doesn't marry up with the task he's facing. When Garnacho is on song, he is the definition of a stress test for defenders.",
      "When at Manchester United, since the start of the 23/24 Premier League season, Garnacho drew a card every 206 minutes. That's elite territory for an attacker and it's not accidental data. He plays on the edge, he attacks defenders with pace and he's very theatrical under contact.",
      "Burnley going away from home still carry that old narrative of blunt, toothless and just happy to compete. But when you hone in on Bournemouth's defensive numbers of late, this trip to the south coast looks far more open than the prices suggest.",
      "Andoni Iraola's men have conceded 21 goals in their last nine games, and that isn't coming from freak results or red-card chaos. It's a structural issue, one that revolves around the centre-backs being far too exposed and unable to defend with the same one-to-one authority as Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "Burnley to score over 1.5 goals is 100/30 with Sky Bet.",
      "I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 36 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 17 games otherwise. Sunderland are fifth in the long passes metric of all Premier League teams this season and are likely to undertake a style of play that causes Brighton issues.",
      "The away team are 6/5 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "A bet that stands out here at the prices is Manchester City to win the cards race at 7/2 with Sky Bet, meaning we need City to be shown more cards than West Ham to land the pot.",
      "Despite the bulky price, this bet has landed in eight of City's last 13 games in all competitions, which points to them carrying a cynical edge to their game of late. This includes in a similar home game against Leeds where they won the card race 4-1 despite being the outsiders in the market.",
      "Across their last eight games, West Ham have seen the opponents average two cards per game with the threat of Jarrod Bowen and Crysensio Summerville triggering some card-worthy action from defenders.",
      "Wolves top the charts this season for fouls committed and Matt Doherty really got into the spirit of things on his return at Arsenal, making a whopping five fouls.",
      "He will be tasked with keeping Kevin Schade quiet - a player that leads the way for fouls drawn this season for Brentford at 1.62 per 90. This makes Doherty's price to make two or more fouls at 5/4 with Sky Bet very appealing.",
      "Of Arne Slot's last 17 wins away from home at Liverpool, 12 of those have seen under 3.5 goals too. That is a relevant trend when assessing the best way to back a pro-Liverpool angle in this fixture.",
      "We all know about Tottenham's issues in forward areas and them being able to create quality chances. All their key attacking metrics have the look of a team that should be battling relegation: 9.6 shots per game, 3.3 shots on target per game, 1.0 expected goals per 90 and 1.8 big chances created per game. It's an underlying attacking process which is the fourth-worst in the Premier League. Another blank may follow here.",
      "You can get 21/10 with Sky Bet on Liverpool to win and under 3.5 goals - a nice boost on the Evens for a Liverpool win.",
      "Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/5 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.7 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 15 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too, including last weekend against Wolves where they delivered the odds in dramatic fashion.",
      "With Everton certainly missing Idrissa Gueye and Iliman Ndiaye and potentially without Keinan Dewsbury-Hall and Jack Grealish, David Moyes is going to have to go back to basics for a result. Defend deep, get the crowd involved and try to cause problems from set pieces. That's unlikely to be enough to work against this Arsenal machine.",
      "This is a fixture where the league table tells you very little, but the calendar tells you everything. At full throttle, with both teams fresh and raring to go, Palace have shown they are the better team.",
      "However, three games in six days, different opponents, different tactical demands and now a trip to Elland Road - one of the most physically demanding environments in English football - tips the scales firmly in Leeds' favour.",
      "Palace's schedule is unique and brutal. And what we've seen from Daniel Farke's team in recent weeks is that they make games an intense battle.",
      "This isn't a bet against Palace's quality. It's a bet against the schedule they're trapped in. Leeds at 8/5 with Sky Bet is best bet of the weekend material.",
      "1pt treble on: Leeds to win, both teams to score & over 2.5 goals in Aston Villa vs Man Utd & Nottingham Forest to win (13/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Friday 19 December 2025 15:18, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says there is a level of entitlement at Manchester United as he defended his comments about the club's academy last week.",
      "Last week, when quizzed on not using academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, Amorim used Harry Amass and Chido Obi as examples, suggesting they were not at the level required for United at the moment.",
      "Both players then posted pictures on their Instagram accounts, which were subsequently deleted, seemingly in response to Amorim's comments. Amass posted a picture of him with a player-of-the-month award at Sheffield Wednesday, while Chido's image was of him celebrating scoring for the U21 side.",
      "When asked about Amass and Obi, Amorim defended his \"strong words\", suggesting the young players at the club feel \"entitled\" and the culture needs to change.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim after being quizzed on his use of academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo:\n\n\n\"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.\n\n\n\"Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in the U21s.\n\n\n\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!'",
      "\"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "\"I'm the first one to say I'm failing inside the pitch,\" he added. \"I have that feeling. We are not performing the way we should be but outside the pitch I guarantee I'm not failing this club.",
      "\"We talk about the players sometimes forget what it means to play for Man Utd, we as a club forget sometimes who we are. That's the feeling that I have.",
      "\"It's the environment, the kids feel entitled and free to respond to the manager with a picture. My office is open but nobody is coming to me. That's the way we can solve things.",
      "\"We need to change as a club.",
      "\"I didn't say anything wrong, I spoke about how the luck of playing for Man Utd. Sometimes you play for Man Utd and see different realities and you understand football can be so different and you are really lucky to be at Man Utd. That was my point, but let's move on.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim says there is no problem with Mainoo after his half-brother's T-shirt stunt and hopes the Manchester United midfielder fights for his future at the club.",
      "The homegrown 20-year-old talent has gone from FA Cup hero and starting the Euro 2024 final for England to a bench player over the last 18 months.",
      "Mainoo saw a request to leave on loan rejected in August and is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the campaign, leading to speculation he could depart United in the January transfer window.",
      "The midfielder came off the bench in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford, where his half-brother Jordan Mainoo-Hames wore a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' top and later posted about it on social media.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Mainoo about the incident, Amorim laughed and then said: \"No, it was not Kobbie that wore the T-shirt.",
      "\"He is not going to start because of the T-shirt, but he is not going to the bench because of the T-shirt. He is going to play if we feel that he is the right guy to play. That is not an issue.",
      "\"I am used to [it]. I am here for a year. It's not new, so we have to deal with that, but I am not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something.\"",
      "It felt like a message to the changing room.",
      "When asked about the situations around Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo this week - Amorim repeatedly spoke about how his office is always open for players to talk to him.",
      "When asked about two young players - Amass and Obi - who both posted messages on social media last week which seemed in defiance of Amorim discussing their lack of first-team involvement this season (both posts were then deleted) - he talked about the feeling of entitlement among the younger players at the squad.",
      "He repeated that word, 'entitlement'.",
      "It is hard to disagree with the United manager. Obi made seven appearances last season while Amass made five for the first team.",
      "Amass this season has continued his development at Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season - a loan the club felt would seriously improve his future prospects at the club, especially his defensive qualities.",
      "Obi - having watched him multiple times for the U21s, still has plenty of improvement to go with coaches in the academy demanding more in his work off the ball and build-up play.",
      "But both - as well as other players last season - received opportunities because of the multiple injuries to the squad while also prioritising the Europa League. This is what Amorim tried to explain last week and he expanded on today.",
      "There will be a high chance for those in the academy like Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher to potentially impress in the next month and I expect a few on the bench on Sunday with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire injured, Casemiro suspended and Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui away for AFCON.",

      "Bruno Fernandes believes he can still win trophies with Manchester United, despite a difficult period for the club; on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the captain also discussed his leadership and how Man Utd has changed since he arrived in January 2020",
      "Thursday 18 December 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has discussed his loyalty to Manchester United, saying he believes the club can return to former glories and win multiple trophies.",
      "The Man Utd captain appeared on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, which was recorded before his explosive interview with Portuguese TV channel Canal 11 was published, and also revealed he stayed at the club despite two offers to leave.",
      "Fernandes told Canal 11 he was \"hurt\" that the club were open to offloading him to Saudi Arabia during the summer.",
      "But speaking to Ferdinand, the midfielder says the club can win regular silverware, and he would not have stayed as long as he has if he did not believe it was possible.",
      "Fernandes said: \"Loyalty in football before was like [Francesco] Totti at Rome, [Ryan] Giggs at United, [Paolo] Maldini at Milan, so when I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was in the toughest periods and I could have left two times.",
      "\"The club said 'no, we need you' and I said 'OK, you gave me something, I will give you something'. The time at the club has not been as I wanted because I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club was still very important and I'm not taking anything away from other players that were here. When we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I hope everyone at the club is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"I'm very aware that I could have gone a different path and probably won more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. Nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.",
      "\"When I speak about going and winning trophies, I stayed here because I think I still can win trophies here. I wouldn't have stayed here if the club hasn't told me our aim is still to be the highest we can be, get back to winning trophies, get back to be the club we were before.",
      "\"If that was not the aim then yes, I wouldn't have stayed here, but because I know the aim of the club is still to get back to where they want to be and where I want the club to be, that's why I came to the club in the first place. If I can help to get back there, that's all I want to do.\"",
      "Fernandes is often the focal point of any Man Utd performance, whether that is having a hand in the goals or his passionate on-field reactions.",
      "That has often been the case since his arrival at Old Trafford in January 2020, with Fernandes also offering an insight into how his team-mates help him maintain the club's standards.",
      "He said: \"As a captain, obviously you're going to get more attention, stick and everything. But that comes with the club also - it's not just by the armband.",
      "\"I haven't changed the way I was for the way I'm now because I've got the armband. When Erik [Ten Hag] chose me to be the captain, he knew what type of captain I was. I know I lead by example, because I do everything is needed to do on the training pitch. I train as hard as I can.",
      "\"I can moan as much as people think, but I run more than I moan - I'm pretty sure of that. So I think I'm still an example of the way things have to be done for the club. The standard.",
      "\"Then I think I treat everyone as I would like to be treated and when I talk about everyone, I don't see anyone below me. For me, everyone's in the same level. It could be me, it could be the people that serve us at the restaurant, the chefs, the nutritionists, the staff.",
      "\"No one is below and no one is above me. Obviously, apart from the bosses, the manager and the other ones that are above the managers, but still, the managers, they say 'guys, I'm in the same level as you, I just have more responsibility and I have to take the decisions. That's where I'm above you'.",
      "\"And as a captain, I have sometimes to make decisions on things. But we have a leadership group that is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Heaton], [Noussair] Mazroui and Diogo [Dalot].",
      "\"We then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro and Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "\"From that six [of the leadership group], the message has to be clear for everyone else. We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone.",
      "\"But that's not just me, it's the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, 'guys, this is what we're going to do and mandatory for us. This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club'.\"",
      "There has been plenty of change at Man Utd in the almost six years since Fernandes joined. He has played under six managers - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and currently, Ruben Amorim, on a permanent basis, with interim spells for Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "There has been silverware, including the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, as well as success - and a lack thereof - in Europe.",
      "On what has changed since he first walked into the dressing room in 2020, Fernandes said: \"There were a lot of experienced players. You had David [De Gea], Nema [Nemanja Matic], Juan [Mata].",
      "\"Paul [Pogba] was already a big player. Jesse [Lingard] was a big player at the time already, you had Rashy [Marcus Rashford]. Then we'd come with a mix of youngest.",
      "\"I think everything has changed in the world of football in the last, not just five years, but also the years I've been in football. Nowadays, the young ones put the music [on] in the dressing room.",
      "\"But I really like the mix we have in the dressing room [now] because it makes me feel very young, the energy they have, the way we involve everyone together, and not looking at age difference, who's been here longer, who's been here less.",
      "\"We don't have that thing of who's more important, who's less important... The energy is very good.\"",

      "Question marks were raised when Erik ten Hag paid £55 million for the then-maligned Chelsea star, especially given his fitness concerns and lack of obvious role in the Dutchman's system.",
      "After early struggles, he seems to have found his feet under Ruben Amorim. Earmarked as an early favourite of the Portuguese, he currently finds himself on his most consistent run in the team at the Theatre of Dreams, already equalling his previous best seasonal goals tally at the club.",
      "For many, Mount has become a focal point in how Amorim wants his United side to play. They clearly get better results when he is in the team - the Red Devils have lost just once in the Premier League when he starts, compared to three times when he doesn't. But the numbers show that doesn't necessarily equate to better performances.",
      "Amorim has often insisted that it doesn't matter in what formation his teams line up in. What matters is the finer details as to how the players operate within it.",
      "\"The most important thing is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past. We need time, but we have to win time. To win time is to win games. But the most important thing is identity,\" were his exact words when he was first hired in November 2024.",
      "While he hasn't spoken out on the specifics of what those principles are, history shows that Amorim's teams focus on a possession-based style built around shorter passes and a high defensive line that enables an assertive pressing approach.",
      "On the surface, that sounds like a way of playing that would suit Mount's strengths. Yet when he is in the team, those characteristics seem to falter.",
      "It has been a 50/50 between games started and games where the Englishman has either come off the bench or not featured. When he starts, United not only pick up more points, but they score more goals (2.25 per game vs 1.50) and are far more efficient when finishing their 'big' chances (1.38 goals vs 0.75).",
      "That points towards a positive impact, which can't be denied. Look further though, and you see that with Mount in the team, United tend to move further away from the fundamentals associated with Amorim.",
      "Though the number of chances created when Mount starts is significantly higher, the number of 'big chances' is lower, suggesting that United have far more low xG efforts built up in these games, rather than creating clearer goalscoring opportunities more frequently.",
      "Some of this lack of higher-quality chances can perhaps be attributed to the fact that there is also a major shift towards a more direct style of play when Mount starts compared to when he doesn't.",
      "With him in the team, United average more long passes. They also attempt 10 per cent fewer passes in the final third and pull off 17 per cent less.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, in games where Mount starts, United win possession back in their attacking third less too. Given that the narrative is that Mount's energy aids United in the press, you'd expect the opposite to be the case.",
      "That is not to say that Mount is the sole reason for the drop-offs.",
      "As an individual, he ranks sixth in the team in chances created, fourth in final third passes attempted and completed, only ninth in long passes and second in possession won in the attacking third among the squad.",
      "By those metrics, you can see that he is doing what you would expect him to do based on Amorim's requirements. Yet, as a collective, United are moving away from Amorim's principles more often when Mount is in the team.",
      "Is that a criticism? If anything, it's the opposite. Much has been said of Amorim's reluctance to adapt his way of playing in order to find success, but the data proves that there is flexibility to be played with.",
      "It is more interesting though that a player who was believed to be the epitome of what Amorim needed from his squad has highlighted that his success is coming when he steers away from the methodology that he was so steadfast in bringing to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""
