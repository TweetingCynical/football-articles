      "Manchester United demonstrated this summer that there are times when a sale is necessary, regardless of whether the deal is ideal for the club or not. Alejandro Garnacho had to be sold in the last transfer window as his relationship with the club was causing more harm than good.",
      "Marcus Rashford was a similar case, albeit to a lesser extent as it seemed he may not have completely severed all ties, but based on the evidence, it was still right to let him go. In retrospect, the Reds made a terrible mistake in letting Scott McTominay leave the football club.",
      "Like Garnacho and Rashford, United profited from the deal, making the books look healthier once he departed for Napoli. However, unlike his former teammates, McTominay was not a problem at United.",
      "His previous manager Erik ten Hag even expressed regret at letting the Scottish international go. Ten Hag hastily decided that he needed to bolster defensive midfield but instead of trying to offload Casemiro, who remains one of the highest paid players at the club, he sold an asset who is now taking the football world by storm.",
      "Remarkably, in his first season in Serie A, McTominay managed to flourish more than anyone anticipated. His tally of 12 goals and six assists marked the best season of his professional career, proving instrumental in Antonio Conte's side clinching the Serie A title.",
      "However, his redemption arc was only fully realised on Monday night when he ranked 18th in the Ballon d'Or standings, ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Florian Wirtz. And let's not forget, there wasn't a single United player to be found anywhere near the Top 30.",
      "At the time, the decision to sell McTominay seemed like a short-term move that hadn't been thoroughly thought through. While no one could have predicted his sensational season in Italy, the 28-year-old's story should serve as a warning for United's future decisions.",
      "History already seems set to repeat itself under Ruben Amorim, with Kobbie Mainoo's future looking increasingly uncertain. He requested a loan move in the summer, which was rejected, and so far, there's little indication that United will be able to satisfy his concerns before the January transfer window opens.",
      "If Mainoo were to 'do a McTominay', he would be better positioned to succeed given his younger age and less inconsistent form at Old Trafford. Failing to address Mainoo's concerns though could once again lead United to make a short-term decision that ultimately hampers the club's long-term progression.",
      "Mainoo is keen to remain with United, which is why he only requested a loan move. However, the rigid adherence to captain Bruno Fernandes could push him towards a permanent exit.",
      "Fernandes' contribution to the team is undeniable, but there's a real chance he could depart next summer. If Mainoo has already been forced out by then, United could find themselves in a tricky situation where they have to replace both men.",
      "Amorim needs to start grooming Mainoo now to be Fernandes' successor. It's clear that he has the talent for it, and United is a club known for giving young players a chance.",
      "If United are to learn anything from McTominay's success, it should be that sometimes it's better to nurture the next generation from within rather than selling them off for quick cash. If Mainoo does leave, it would demonstrate that the Reds haven't learned their lesson, at all.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing up a new shot-stopper, despite the recent acquisition of Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for a cool £18.2million plus add-ons. The Belgian is yet to feature for Ruben Amorim's squad with Altay Bayindir preferred.",
      "The 23-year-old has already made his presence known on the bench during the Manchester derby, but head coach Ruben Amorim insists there's no guaranteed number one keeper in his squad. \"No, nobody has a place that is his place,\" he responded when quizzed about whether Bayindir was his first choice following Andre Onana's loan move to Trabzonspor.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.\"",
      "Despite Bayindir starting every Premier League match so far, he's yet to fully win over the coaching staff. Prior to signing Lammens, United had reportedly agreed personal terms with World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa, but ultimately opted for the Belgian.",
      "Chelsea attempted to snap him up in the summer with a £12million bid, falling short of Milan's £21million asking price. It's understood that United bigwigs have recently been in talks with Maignan's representatives, who also manage £65million summer signing Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Alongside a new shot-stopper, United are also looking to splash the cash on a midfielder. Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba is reportedly on their radar, especially with Casemiro's contract due to run out next year.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club is also currently uncertain after failing to break into Amorim's plans. The England international has been used mainly off the bench this season and has been linked with a move away.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been told that Barcelona were absolutely right to discipline him for reportedly arriving late to a pre-match meeting, with his behaviour being slammed as \"disrespectful\". The on-loan Manchester United forward began last week brilliantly with a spectacular two-goal display for the La Liga club away to Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "But the 27-year-old found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench for Barcelona's 3-0 victory over Getafe on Sunday after widespread reports in Spain claimed he arrived two minutes late to a team briefing. Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now cautioned Rashford that his conduct is \"not good enough\" whilst supporting Barca boss Hansi Flick's uncompromising stance on punctuality.",
      "It follows the Mirror reporting that the two clubs remain significantly apart regarding an agreement on the transfer fee needed to make the England international's loan switch permanent. Barcelona are believed to be eager to sign Rashford at a knockdown price of £26million, whilst United are hoping to secure closer to £35m for their academy product.",
      "Foster voiced his frustration over Rashford's latest indiscretion, despite lauding him for recapturing his best form in the Newcastle clash.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Rashford got a couple of goals, it was a fantastic performance and he just looked proper. It was old school Marcus Rashford and we love to see it.",
      "\"Then he goes and gets dropped at the weekend because he was late for a team stretching session on the morning of a game. The way that Barcelona have dealt with it, you can tell Hansi Flick doesn't take any s***.\"",
      "Foster later added: \"It's disrespectful and I understand people going, 'Oh, he's [only] a minute or two late,' but it doesn't matter. There are 29 other people there who are waiting for you. If you can't get the basics right, then it's not good enough.\"",
      "Rashford isn't the only player to fall foul of Flick's strict discipline code, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and most recently Raphinha all facing sanctions for similar infractions. Rashford was expected to start the Getafe clash on the left flank of Barcelona's attack, but Ferran Torres was selected in his place.",
      "Despite being left out, he displayed no visible signs of annoyance and entered the fray to replace Raphinha at the interval. Rashford shone on the right wing, setting up Dani Olmo's decisive third goal that sealed victory.",
      "Rashford is spending the campaign on loan at Barca after falling out with United boss Ruben Amorim. He spent the latter half of last term on loan at Aston Villa before switching to the Nou Camp.",
      "He has featured six times so far and opened his account against Newcastle last week. No recall provision exists in the loan deal between United and Barca, with the Catalan giants holding an option to secure his services permanently next summer.",

      "Former Aston Villa star Stan Collymore has predicted Manchester United will soon be 'sniffing around' Unai Emery to replace Ruben Amorim. Current Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after a dismal start to the season - the club's worst since the 1992/93 campaign.",
      "Currently languishing in 11th place in the Premier League, United also suffered an embarrassing League Cup defeat at the hands of Grimsby Town. The club's rocky start follows a disappointing 15th place finish last season - their lowest in the Premier League era.",
      "Adding insult to injury, they were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May, meaning Old Trafford has no European football for the first time in over 10 years. With Amorim's position becoming increasingly precarious, it's no surprise that some of Europe's top managerial talent are being linked with the job.",
      "One such name is Villa's Emery, who was rumoured to be in the frame during Erik ten Hag's troubled tenure at United last year. Despite a slow start to the season with Villa, Emery's work in Birmingham has been widely lauded.",
      "His potential departure from Villa Park seems more plausible following the exit of the club's President of Football Operations, Monchi, on Monday, as he and Emery have been closely associated. Now, Collymore has weighed in on the unexpected news from his old club.",
      "\"Monchi. Lots of social media with others in recruitment about how hard they worked (so do others, especially Brighton and Bournemouth) which struck a chord with Villans as the going was good,\" he said via X (Twitter).",
      "\"But I make it three resounding successes in the market (players who play for the first team, not jiggery pokery for PSR) in Tielemans, Rogers and Pau out of a 20+ incoming of players. That's average recruitment at best. Emery wanted him and this now raises the question as to whether Unai's tenure will now grind to an end of season halt (*fires starting pistol on speculation every week about United, etc etc etc) or whether Unai has agreed with my analysis, biffed off a great friend but \"business is business\" and a new shiny recruitment guy comes in with a better strike rate.",
      "\"Said on here a few weeks back that recruitment at a club like Villa has to be at 80+% success rate in order to compete so that's the task for the new person. I hope Emery strikes up a rapport with someone new and gets his mojo back, doubles down and commits to the long haul.",
      "\"He's not of our neck of the woods though, he'll have suitors in Spain, probably one or two big Italian clubs and should United be serious about change then they'll have a sniff too, why wouldn't they, they can offer almost unlimited resources to back up what Villa did last season with multiple seasons of serious cash support.",
      "\"The next 48 hours will tell everything. If he's bullish and wants to stay, you'll see it as he's a straight talker. If he doesn't look at the camera, fidgits with his ear and doesn't answer 'do you see your long term at Villa?' then the owners and new recruitment guy need to get a list together quickly in case he exits sooner or end of season. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. UP THE RECRUITMENTLESS VILLA.\"",

      "The Old Trafford side had been leading 2-0 after Robert Sanchez was sent off in the fifth minute, with goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. However, Casemiro was also shown a red card just before half time, and Trevoh Chalobah capitalised on some slack defending to head home with 10 minutes left.",

Despite his superb match-winning brace against Newcastle in the Champions League last week, the on-loan striker found himself on the bench for Barca’s La Liga clash with Getafe on Sunday.",
      "Rashford came off the bench at half-time and set up a Dani Olmo goal as Hansi Flick’s side strolled to a 3-0 home win. Since the game, it has been widely reported in Spain that Rashford was cut from the starting line-up after being two minutes late for a team rendezvous.",
      "His tardiness has been attributed to filling out an electronic form, which the club requires every player to complete each day. The Manchester United loanee wasn’t late for the pre-match activation session, due to start an hour later, but Flick, a strict disciplinarian, insists any player who doesn’t arrive on time doesn’t start the following game.",
      "Rashford isn’t the first player to be affected by the German coach’s team rules, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and, most recently, Raphinha being dropped for similar reasons. Rashford was reportedly due to start the Getafe game on the left side of Barca’s attack, but Ferran Torres got the nod instead.",
      "His response to his omission was telling, though, with no suggestion that he sulked about being dropped. After replacing Raphinha at the break, Rashford impressed on the right side of the attack as well as laying on Olmo’s game-clinching third goal.",
      "While the Spanish media has largely overlooked aside Rashford’s indiscretion, former Spain international Lluis Carreras wasn’t so lenient as he backed Flick’s methods.

      "When questioned about his decision to bench Rashford, Flick insisted he was managing the forward’s workload, saying: “For Rashford, it’s normal not to play. Matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes.",
      "“You saw that with Fermin. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.",
      "“We scored three goals, and it's not always easy to score three goals against a strong team. I don't want to talk about the opponent; I want to talk about my team. We must focus on our game and our plan.” Barca, who are two points behind leaders Real Madrid, visit Real Oviedo on Thursday.",

      "Rio Ferdinand claimed Benjamin Sesko may have to take a leaf out of Ruud van Nistelrooy's book and walk out of training if he wants his Manchester United team-mates to know what his demands are.",
      "The Slovenian's goalless start to life at Old Trafford continued on Saturday as he fired a blank against 10-man Chelsea. Sesko was hauled off at half-time, which was not a glowing assessment of his performance, with the striker largely ineffective during his time on the pitch.",
      "Sesko was signed for £74million and that price tag is set to hang over him until he finds the back of the net. Ferdinand couldn't believe his lack of involvement in what was a dominant first-half display for the Red Devils - in part owing to his lack of service.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"In the first half, against 10 men, he’s had six touches. Six touches! I think the responsibility goes to the striker as well [as other players].",
      "\"In today’s game there’s enough at your disposal technology-wise and clip-wise that you can get it in black and white on the iPad and say to your team-mates, ‘You know when you got in that position, look where I am.'\"",
      "Ferdinand referenced scenarios where Amad, playing out wide, had the opportunity to find Sesko but didn't.",
      "As a result he's recalled how Van Nistelrooy, who scored 150 times in Manchester, once walked off the training pitch when Cristiano Ronaldo didn't cross him the ball to him and believes Sesko could benefit from a similar act.",
      "He added: \"It’s decision making in the final third that’s going to set him free or it isn’t, and he’s got to try and dictate to a lot of those players either through runs that make it so obvious or physically telling them after a game.",
      "\"They’re the type of conversations he has to have because I know Ruud [van Nistelrooy] was having that.",
      "\"I saw Ruud van Nistelrooy walk off the training field because Ronaldo did too many step overs and he wasn’t playing it when he wanted it. You’ve got to find it from somewhere to make your team-mates know, and that will be the making of him.\"",
      "Sesko arrived with a reputation as one of Europe's best young strikers. He had impressed at RB Leipzig.",
      "But so far in Manchester, Ruben Amorim has started him from the bench in three of his five games, albeit the 22-year-old has not furthered his case when he has started.",

      "Brazilian legend Ronaldinho remains one of the most painful 'what if' stories in Manchester United's modern era. The Red Devils were tantalisingly close to landing the 2002 World Cup champion's signature in 2023, but a dramatic eleventh-hour U-turn saw the future Ballon d'Or recipient choose Barcelona instead.",
      "The mesmerising attacker was allegedly mere days away from being unveiled as United's latest marquee signing during the club's pre-season American tour in the summer of '03. Yet even Sir Alex Ferguson's magnetic appeal couldn't compete with the irresistible pull of the Catalan giants.",
      "Ronaldinho subsequently became the planet's finest footballer whilst in Spain. He claimed the Ballon d'Or in 2005 whilst securing two La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2006.",
      "In his memoir, Sir Alex revealed precisely how near the Brazilian transfer came to completion. \"I had agreed a deal to bring him to Old Trafford. Carlos Quieroz [United's assistant manager at the time] was there and would vouch for that,\" Ferguson wrote.",
      "\"The attempt to buy Ronaldinho reflected the fact that United have always sported talismanic players. I was always hunting for that kind of talent. My line of reasoning was, 'We're getting £25m for Beckham, and we're getting Ronaldinho for £19m. For God's sake, wake up. It was a steal.\"",
      "Among them was former United midfielder Paul Scholes, who revealed he went from getting ready to welcome the then-PSG star to trying to tackle him in a friendly just days afterwards.",
      "Speaking on Robbie Savage's Savage Social podcast, Scholes said: \"We were away at pre-season and I think they were as close as announcing him and giving him the number, but he ended up changing his mind last minute and he signed for Barcelona.",
      "\"It's strange really because that pre-season tour we were playing against Barcelona, so we were all excited. We thought he was going to bring something special, almost like what (Eric) Cantona brought to the team. Then three days later we're playing against him in Seattle, so everyone's trying to kick him! We were trying to beat him because he didn't sign for us.\"",
      "Ronaldinho told El Enganche in 2014 that boardroom changes at Barcelona, plus the club's track record of nurturing Brazilian talent, swayed his decision.",
      "\"Everything was beautiful and happened fast. A great friend of mine was about to become a part of the Barcelona board: Sandro Rosell,\" Ronaldinho said. \"I was almost on my way to Manchester United and only the details needed to be put onto that deal. But in the last minute Rosell called me to tell me they would win the election. That made everything happen fast. I wanted to play in Barcelona.",
      "\"I had the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of my idols. I was proud to play where Romario, Ronaldo and Rivaldo had played and I had the chance to be Barcelona's new 'R.' I loved that.\"",
      "While United may have missed out on Ronaldinho, Sir Alex soon after snapped up a young talent named Cristiano Ronaldo, and as they say, the rest is history.",

      "Manchester United were able to savour their hard-fought 2-1 victory over Chelsea over the weekend. Ruben Amorim’s side were given an early gift after Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent off but United were forced to fight for the win at Old Trafford after Casemiro’s dismissal at the end of the first half.",
      "Amorim would have enjoyed his side earning an important three points as United aim to build momentum. After the Chelsea result, Amorim was asked about one of his predecessors after Jose Mourinho was appointed the new Benfica manager last week.",
      "Meanwhile, United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo played a minor role in the club’s victory, replacing club captain and goal scorer Bruno Fernandes in the 87th minute. Former United defender Phil Jones has questioned Mainoo’s place in the pecking order and suggested that the England international could soon look to move on from the Red Devils.",
      "One player who has already left Old Trafford is Marcus Rashford after sealing his loan move to Barcelona this summer. The La Liga champions have the option to make Rashford’s switch permanent for £26million and the England international demonstrated his ability with an impressive brace against Newcastle United last week.",
      "Rashford may not have expected to start Barcelona’s 3-0 victory over Getafe on the bench after scoring a Champions League brace in his previous outing. The 27-year-old’s performance sent a clear reminder of what United are missing out on after agreeing to loan out the forward for a second time.",
      "However, The Athletic reported that Rashford was not included in Barcelona’s starting lineup against Getafe after turning up late to training on the day of the match. His Barcelona team-mates Raphinha, Jules Kounde and Inaki Pena have all previously fallen foul of the same rule in the past.",
      "Despite beginning the game against Getafe on the bench, Rashford quickly made up for lost time after replacing Raphina at the break. The United loanee took just 17 minutes to provide an assist for Dani Olmo as Barcelona completed the 3-0 scoreline as he provided the perfect response to being dropped to the bench.",
      "For his part, Flick played down any sense of his team selection being because of a disciplinary issue. \"For Rashford, it's normal not to play, matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes,” he said. “You saw that with Fermin. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim sent a clear message to Jose Mourinho after the former United boss was named Bruno Lage’s successor at Benfica. Amorim was linked with the Portuguese giants, where he spent much of his playing career, before Mourinho’s appointment. Following United’s win over Chelsea, Amorim credited Mourinho’s early successes for giving other Portuguese coaches, such as himself, the chance to get top jobs.",
      "\"He’s the best Portuguese manager, and that won’t change.\" Amorim told DAZN Portugal, as reported by A Bola . He’s always been a very special person in our football, but also in the world, and he opened all the doors for us.",
      "\"I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Jose Mourinho. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun for you in Portugal, and we’re going to enjoy it. But that’s the way it is, and we’ll be here, watching to see what happens, but focused only on Manchester, and that will be my only club.\"",
      "Former United defender Phil Jones fears that Amorim’s reluctance to start Kobbie Mainoo could see the midfielder leave the club in the near future. Mainoo saw a loan request rejected during the final days of the summer transfer window, but the 20-year-old has made jus three substitute appearances in the Premier League, with his only start coming against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager has already come out and stated he's not going to be playing with Bruno,\" Jones said of Mainoo’s situation on Stadium Astro. \"It's going to be him or the other and you're not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he's in and the way that he carries the team at times with his assists and goals.",
      "\"So, he's going to find it difficult for games and United aren't in any European competitions this season. There's not another competition that he might've got some game-time in.",
      "\"Time will tell, but I think by Christmas and January time, if he's not had the game time that he'll like, then I'm sure he will be trying to force a loan move.\"",

      "Chelsea will be hoping to return to winning ways against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup tonight, after falling to a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United. The Blues were hit with disaster early on as goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent off in the first five minutes for a last-man foul on Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro fired United into a 2-0 in the first 45 minutes, before the Brazilian was also sent off after receiving a second booking for a foul on Andrey Santos. Trevoh Chalobah made it 2-1 on the 80th minute, but it ended in defeat in Alejandro Garnacho's first game back at Old Trafford.",
      "Blues boss Enzo Maresca made some interesting substitutions throughout the game - likely due to his 'keeper's dismissal - with the Argentinian not making it off the bench against his old club. Midfield superstar Cole Palmer was also taken off early against United, as the Italian issued a fresh update on the England international's fitness as he struggles with a groin issue.",
      "Meanwhile, incoming Chelsea striker Emanuel Emegha was snubbed by the Strasbourg fans after scoring the winner as captain at the weekend. Despite celebrating his strike in front of the supporters, many of the crowd looked less-than-impressed with his appearance on the pitch.",
      "Garnacho returned to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40million switch to Chelsea in the summer - but he didn't make it off the bench.",
      "As Chelsea chased an equaliser during the final 10 minutes, many would've thought that the Argentinian winger would've been brought on for his flash of pace and ability on the flanks. And this was part of the plan. However, despite receiving tactical instructions in the second half, Garnacho never made it onto the pitch.",
      "Maresca has confirmed that this decision to snub the 21-year-old was down to the need to make substitutions elsewhere.",
      "Speaking post-match, the Italian said: \"Garnacho was ready to go, but then Wes [Fofana] asked for the change because he was tired after a long time so we decided to go for Malo [Gusto].",
      "\"But the idea was to give Garnacho minutes.\"",
      "Garnacho's return to United was met with a hostile reception from fans, with a symphony of boos ringing out every time he made an appearance from the bench during warm-ups.",
      "When asked if the poor atmosphere towards the youngster affected his decision to sub Garnacho on, Maresca shrugged off this notion and remained resolute in his first answer.",
      "He said: \"No, no, no. He was ready, I sent him for the warm up and he was ready but then Wes asked for the change so we decided to go with Malo.\"",
      "Incoming Chelsea striker Emanuel Emegha dealt with his own troubles in a similar fashion to Garnacho at the weekend, despite scoring for Strasbourg on Sunday. The 22-year-old has agreed a seven-year deal with the Blues, but won't head to Stamford Bridge until 2026.",
      "This means that the Strasbourg captain will remain with his current club - who function under the same owners as Chelsea - for the first half of the French season. However, this news hasn't been met with the best of responses from the fans, who have made their feelings known towards Emegha.",
      "In the club's 1-0 win over Le Havre last week, the striker was left out of the starting line-up, but a banner still went up in the crowd slamming the star's Chelsea move. It read: \"Emegha, pawn of BlueCo, after changing your shirt, give back your armband.\"",
      "This distaste continued into Strasbourg's 3-2 win against Paris FC, where Emegha topped off his return to action with a goal, which was subsequently confirmed by VAR after being chopped off initially.",
      "During the celebrations, the 22-year-old ran up to the away crowd and held his shirt up to them in a statement of intent. While some fans celebrated the goal, many could be seen looking unimpressed - which angered boss Liam Rosenior.",
      "The 41-year-old said: \"Emegha was devastated, and I was too. I am very disappointed by what I saw. Seeing banners against one of last season’s best players is unacceptable.\"",
      "The sale of Emegha to Chelsea was brought forward due to UEFA rulings, as per L'Equipe. If the two clubs had ended up playing in the same European competition next season, then the transfer would've been blocked - but it seems that Strasbourg fans aren't bothered much about the legal inner-workings of the deal.",
      "Maresca has issued a positive update to star player Cole Palmer ahead of the club's Carabao Cup tie against Lincoln City. The midfielder was taken off against United, in one of three substitutes within the first 20 minutes after Sanchez' red card and Fernandes' opener for the Red Devils.",
      "The England international had previously struggled with a groin injury, and Maresca confirmed that this issue is unlikely to result in surgery.",
      "Speaking ahead of the trip to the League One side, he said: \"The medical staff, they didn’t mention to me about surgery until today. I don’t know if in the next days or the next weeks, but I don’t think so, to be honest.\"",
      "However, it is likely that Palmer won't be in the starting line-up against Lincoln in midweek, with the Italian being able to rest some key players as they take on a lower-league side.",
      "The Blues have two tough games coming up in the Premier League and in Europe. Brighton and Hove Albion will come calling on Saturday, before ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho brings his Benfica side to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League.",
      "It is most possible that Palmer will be looking ahead to these tests, with other fringe stars being handed opportunities in domestic cup fixtures as and when they come up.",

      "Manchester United have been informed why the correct call was made to send off Casemiro during their weekend triumph over Chelsea.",

      "Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was shown a straight red inside the opening five minutes following a challenge on Bryan Mbeumo just outside the box. Casemiro was shown a red card in first-half stoppage times after collecting two yellows for challenges on Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos.",
      "The decision to give Casemiro his second caution has sparked discussion after referee Peter Bankes gave the United midfielder his marching orders. Now, ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has revealed why he thinks the right call was made",
      "\"The second one - people will say to me, 'Is it enough for a second yellow card?' I am forever saying not every tackle after a yellow card is a second yellow card, but the difference here is he has deliberately gone to pull him back.",
      "\"We see every week, we are saying 'Everybody who is pulled back gets a second yellow card'. People say, 'He [Casemiro] got the ball', he gets the ball because he pulls him [Santos] back. I think second yellow card, red card.\"",
      "However, former Premier League striker Jay Bothroyd disagreed, arguing that Casemiro should not have been dismissed for his challenge on Santos. \"I think that was harsh,\" Bothroyd stated.",
      "\"On the pitch, players know exactly what is going on. The player [Santos] has actually run across Casemiro, he can't get out of the way because he is running as well at speed.",

      "As a result of receiving two yellow cards, Casemiro will now serve a one-match ban, ruling him out of the Premier League match against Brentford this weekend. The Brazilian will be eligible to play again in United's home game against Sunderland on October 4.",

      "Manchester United will pursue a 'major goalkeeper' in next summer's transfer window after Ruben Amorim confirmed that neither Altay Bayindir or the club's most recent signing, Senne Lammens, are locked in as the team's No 1.",
      "United responded by sealing an £18.2million deal for Lammens on the final day of the summer transfer window. However, the 23-year-old Belgian is viewed as a quality prospect for the future and is not guaranteed to play ahead of Bayindir, who looked more assured in Saturday evening's 2-1 win over Chelsea.",
      "But despite spending a significant sum on Lammens just weeks ago, The Sun claim that United plan to bolster their goalkeeping options again next summer, with an elite shot-stopper on the club's wishlist with Onana moving to Turkey.",
      "It remains to be seen who the Red Devils will target, though. They also weighed up a move for Emi Martinez before pressing ahead with a deadline day swoop for Lammens after seeing an audacious loan bid for the Aston Villa goalkeeper rejected earlier in the transfer window. It's understood he would have cost significantly more than Lammens, who is viewed as Belgium's next No 1 keeper.",
      "Onana was signed for a fee in excess of £47m back in the summer of 2023 as the club decided to part ways with their long-term No 1, David de Gea. However, Onana has looked a shadow of the goalkeeper who starred for Inter Milan, making a string of errors during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Bayindir has also struggled to convince when deputising for Onana. He was at fault for the only goal of the game in United's 1-0 loss against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season but has been picked for all five league games so far this term.",
      "\"No, nobody has a place that is his place,\" Amorim said recently when he was asked if Bayindir was now United's first-choice keeper. \"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",

The Portuguese boss had reportedly been earmarked as a possible replacement after Bruno Lage's sacking, with his own position at Old Trafford looking shaky in recent weeks.",
      "Portuguese media claimed that Joao Noronha Lopes, standing in next month's Benfica presidential race, held Amorim in particularly high regard. The 40-year-old manager was allegedly included on his shortlist of prospective coaching targets.",
      "When addressing the speculation, Noronha Lopes said: \"Ruben Amorim? He's a great coach, he has a contract with Manchester United. I won't comment on that. Of course I like him. He's a great coach and a Benfica fan. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign.\"",
      "The rumour mill was silenced when Jose Mourinho's appointment was confirmed by Benfica last Friday.",
      "Amorim was subsequently questioned about the 'Special One's' new job during a post-match interview following the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea. The United head coach served an apprenticeship under Mourinho at United during his early coaching days, and he spoke glowingly of his fellow countryman. \"He's the best Portuguese manager, and that won't change,\" Amorim told Portuguese channel DAZN.",

      "Barcelona are hoping to make Marcus Rashford's loan switch a permanent one at a bargain price of £26m. That fee is lower than the £35m that Manchester United believe the 27-year-old is worth.",
      "Rashford has been loaned to the Catalan giants for the season following a fallout with United management. The forward spent the latter half of the previous season on loan at Aston Villa before moving to the Nou Camp. He's had a cracking start with the Spanish side, contributing to their undefeated beginning to the new season.",
      "Rashford has already made six appearances and netted his first goals with a spectacular double in last week's Champions League victory over Newcastle. There's no recall clause in the loan agreement between United and Barca, meaning his parent club can't bring Rashford back this season.",
      "Barca have the option to make the move permanent next summer, but they're keen to negotiate a lower price with United, reports the Daily Star. Rashford is settling well in Barcelona and, if things continue to go smoothly, he'll be keen to stay. That's despite being benched for Sunday's match against Getafe after reportedly infuriating manager Hansi Flick by turning up late for a team meeting before training.",
      "However, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be willing to let Rashford go cheaply. He knows that the better Rashford performs in Barcelona, the higher his value will rise.",
      "There's also the tantalising prospect of the striker having a successful run with England in next summer's World Cup, assuming he makes it into Thomas Tuchel's squad. Since his move to Barca, Rashford has found himself back in Tuchel's long-term plans.",
      "Rashford is tied down to United on a whopping £300,000-a-week contract until 2028. It's believed he has no plans to ever return to his boyhood club, having made the tough choice to take his career in a different direction.",
      "Even if Barca and United can't agree on a permanent fee for him next summer, Rashford would still be looking for a new club other than United.",

      "Manchester United could face a Premier League probe and potential disciplinary measures following their 2-1 triumph over Chelsea. United picked up a crucial win thanks to first-half goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, but Harry Maguire may have landed the club in hot water.",
      "Social media clips have emerged showing Maguire breaching multi-ball regulations after being hauled off in the second half by Ruben Amorim. Rather than trudging across the pitch when substituted for Leny Yoro, referee Peter Bankes directed him to exit via the nearest route.",
      "Two spare balls sit atop cones positioned behind each goal line, aligned with the penalty area. Players must collect them from these designated spots to resume play, with multi-ball designed to cut down match disruptions when the ball leaves the field.",
      "The Premier League confirms the system, launched in the 2022/23 campaign, \"intends to maintain the flow of matches and reduce delays\". Officials stress that \"adherence to the relevant rules and guidance is of vital importance to maintain consistency and, crucially, to ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "Outfield players must either fetch the match ball personally or grab a replacement from the cones instead of accepting them from ball assistants. Ball assistants positioned behind each goal are permitted to provide footballs exclusively to goalkeepers preparing to take goal kicks.",
      "The multi-ball system regulations specify: \"Participants (including but not limited to players, substitutes, occupants of the Technical Area or any other club personnel) must not interfere with the multi-ball system, the match ball or the replacement balls at any time.\"",
      "The rules further state: \"Any failure to follow the multi-ball protocol will be referred to the Premier League for further investigation and possible regulatory action under the Premier League rules.\"",
      "Whilst no severe consequences are anticipated following the incident, Maguire might reconsider his actions should he be approached regarding the footage. Maguire was making his first start of the season in the Premier League on Saturday, having previously come off the bench against Arsenal, Fulham and Manchester City.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has previously criticised the Ballon d'Or voting system, claiming that both he and Vinicius Junior have been overlooked for the prestigious award. In 2024, Manchester City's Rodri was awarded the honour, beating Vini Jr in the process.",
      "The Real Madrid star had a successful campaign, winning the Champions League, La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup. In contrast, Rodri claimed the Premier League, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup.",
      "He also outshone the Brazilian on the international stage, securing the European Championship with Spain. Numerous arguments were made for Vini Jr. to win the Ballon d'Or, including from ex-Manchester United legend and Madrid star Ronaldo, who believes he and the winger share the same feelings of being unjustly treated in the voting.",
      "Speaking to La Sexta at the time, the five-time winner said: \"There is no credibility, Vinicius should be the Ballon d'Or winner. I have felt it many times and I felt angry. Over time I understood it, these are battles that you cannot win.\"",
      "Ronaldo was likely referring to Lionel Messi, who holds the record for the most Ballon d'Or trophies with eight, three more than Ronaldo. The iconic duo have competed for the award for two decades, with Messi winning an unprecedented four in a row from 2009 to 2012.",
      "The Portuguese forward pipped Messi to his first Ballon d'Or, claiming it in 2008 whilst still in Manchester working under Sir Alex Ferguson. The Argentinian then secured four consecutive awards, before Ronaldo claimed the prize in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.",
      "Messi secured another four Ballon d'Ors in 2015, 2019, 2021 and 2023 - following his legendary World Cup triumph - establishing himself as the most decorated player in the award's history over the past two decades.",
      "Ronaldo has previously expressed his frustration with the award's selection process, even revealing to Piers Morgan that he believes he should conclude his career with more Ballon d'Ors than Messi.",
      "Speaking in 2019, he said: \"Messi's in the history of football. But I think I have to have six or seven or eight to be above him.\"",
      "Discussing his bond with the Argentine, the now-40-year-old added: \"My relationship with him is, we are not friends, but we have shared this stage for 15 years. I know that he has pushed me to be a better player and I have pushed him to be a better player as well.\"",
      "Cut to 2025, and both Ronaldo and Messi are not in the running for this year's Ballon d'Or. Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembele and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal are regarded as the frontrunners for the 2025 men's accolade, and it appears that Messi and Ronaldo's decades of supremacy in the award seem to be drawing to a close.",
      "With a staggering 13 Ballon d'Ors between them, it's clear that, regardless of Ronaldo's personal feelings towards the ceremony, he has left an indelible mark on football that will be debated for years to come.",

      "Last week, as Ruben Amorim’s side were preparing to face Chelsea in a crucial Premier League match, Manchester United released their financial results for the 2024/25 season. The campaign may have been a nightmare on the pitch, but there was good news off it.",
      "The club announced record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m. Thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos’ brutal cost-cutting exercises, which have included 400 redundancies, United’s overall loss of £113.2m was slashed to £33m.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season – their worst placing since 1973/74. They then compounded things by losing the Europa League final against Tottenham to miss out on a trophy and a place in this season’s Champions League.",
      "This was undeniably a miserable end to a dreadful season. And yet, from a financial perspective, there was a silver lining for the club’s accountants, who did not have to pay out a 25 per cent bonus to the players, which would have been payable if they had reached the Champions League. Wages were therefore cut by a whopping £51.5m to £313.2m – their lowest level since 2019/20.",
      "Even while Amorim’s side are struggling, winning just 18 of their 48 matches in all competitions under the Portuguese boss, brand United keeps powering on, seemingly unaffected by the quality of the product itself.",
      "Woodward, United’s former executive vice-chairman, is not a popular figure among fans. But he was right – and Ratcliffe and the Glazer family are continuing on that path, with commercial deals with Adidas and Snapdragon helping get the club out of a period of stagnation.",
      "United are such a money-making machine that the club can afford to keep increasing debt. It now stands at just under £1.2bn, which is made up of £742m in financial debt and £447m in fees associated with transfers.",
      "One of the biggest gripes with supporters in terms of the Glazer family, who have owned the club since 2003, is the sky-high debt. That figure is now at an all-time high and has increased significantly since Ratcliffe and Ineos took over running the sporting side of the club in February 2024.",
      "“Manchester United generate enough money through ticket sales, commercial deals, merchandise and being popular with broadcasters to manage the debt easily,” Maguire explains. “It’s not a concern, but it is symbolic. Spurs have borrowed a lot, but they have a fantastic new stadium; United have borrowed a lot and they have the Glazers and clearly that’s an issue.",
      "“They’ve spent a lot of money on players – there’s no denying that, and it’s far more than they’ve generated from player sales and as a result the borrowings have gone up substantially. Despite Jim Ratcliffe putting money into the club through a share issue, they’ve had to borrow £130m in terms of increases to the overdraft net. They’ve also borrowed money since the end of the season and that’s very inconsistent with Ratcliffe’s claim that they would’ve gone bust by Christmas.”",
      "United may not have European football this season, but they are looking abroad for more money-making opportunities. A much-criticised post-season tour happened for the first time this summer before a pre-season tour of the Far East. And now they are reportedly considering mid-season friendlies in the Middle East.",
      "Maguire has a theory about the direction of travel at United, who are planning a new stadium in a regenerated Old Trafford area. “The fans are now paying for it in a sense. Yes, it’s record revenues, partly due to the fact that match day revenues are up significantly, which is due to higher prices, so fans are generating this,” he says.",
      "“I think what they’re trying to do is turn Old Trafford from a football stadium into more of an experience. We’re seeing traditional fans, who have sat with their mates for the last 30 years, being turfed out. Their seats behind the dugout can be sold as a ‘manager experience’.",
      "“What you will see from Ineos is a marginalisation of Manchester United’s traditional, local fanbase to try and replace them with more wealthy fans who want something memorable because they only get the opportunity to come once or twice a year and they’re prepared to pay for the privilege.”",
      "Essentially, United are continuing to trade off their glory years under Sir Alex Ferguson, who helped turn the club into a colossus both on and off the pitch. While the performances have disappeared, the other side of things remains.",
      "“They owe a huge debt to Sir Alex Ferguson, because he built the brand, with their success in that era coinciding with the growth of satellite television when they were the dominant club in the dominant league, which brought them global attention,” Maguire adds. “Now they can do pre-season and post-season tours. United fans will come and watch them regardless of their league position.",
      "“Football isn’t like many other products. If I go to a restaurant and have a few bad meals, I’ll find an alternative restaurant. But if my football team are bobbins for a few years, I’ll still turn up even if I moan a bit more. You have that lifelong brand loyalty with a football club that Manchester United are in a great position to exploit.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former referee Dermot Gallagher has backed the decision to send off Chelsea's goalkeeper Robert Sanchez early in their Premier League clash against Manchester United. Sanchez was given his marching orders for denying a goalscoring opportunity when he fouled Bryan Mbeumo outside the penalty box.",
      "\"You see a goalkeeper come out, whatever reason he comes out for, it takes out Mbeumo. I don't think anybody would argue it's a red card. A big decision four minutes in, and he (referee Peter Bankes) rose to it.\"",
      "Football pundit Jay Bothroyd also agreed with the decision, remarking: \"It was reckless, wasn't it? I have got a bit of sympathy here though for Sanchez, obviously, the weather, as you can see, it's really wet.",
      "\"The ball bounces differently; it skidded forward. There's no doubt about it, it's a red card, it's just so early in the game I think he got his starting position wrong.",
      "\"Ultimately, either way, (he's) stopping a goalscoring opportunity and that tackle was high anyway.\"",
      "United capitalised on their numerical advantage in the opening period, with strikes from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro establishing a 2-0 lead. However, Casemiro was shown a second yellow card moments before the interval to level the playing field.",
      "Chelsea rallied in the second period, with Trevoh Chalobah netting in the 80th minute. But, they were unable to locate the crucial equaliser.",
      "They did have appeals for a spot-kick, though, when Joao Pedro tumbled in the area following a challenge from Noussair Mazraoui. Chelsea's appeals were dismissed by Bankes, and Gallagher has stated it was the correct decision.",
      "\"Referees do things by instinct,\" he said. \"Watch the ball change direction, the ball changed direction because he gets it.",
      "\"If you see the referee's position, that is what he sees. The referee actually sees the ball change direction, turns and waves it away.\"",
      "Once more, Bothroyd was in agreement. \"If he had given that, it would be a really soft penalty,\" he said.",
      "\"I know what Pedro is doing; he can see there is going to be contact. The attacker is trying to play smart.",
      "\"He has slightly touched the ball, I think that's what saves him – the slight touch on it. I think if you are going to give penalties like that, I think that is really soft.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford was talismanic for Barcelona in their Champions League win against Newcastle last week.",
      "Then Rashford reported late for a team meeting and was dropped against Getafe. Rashford was only two minutes late, but Hansi Flick enforced a disciplinary rule that meant he lost his starting role.",
      "Rashford might have been stuck in traffic or slept through his alarm. And it was just two minutes, but he is paid handsomely to do his job and should be able to follow Flick's rules at Barcelona.",
      "Manchester United wouldn't have been shocked to hear of Rashford's punishment for being late to the meeting, as there have been concerns about his off-field behaviour in recent years.",
      "Rashford was not axed from the club after a boozy jaunt to Belfast. Erik ten Hag was furious at the trip, but believed it would be detrimental to freeze Rashford out of his plans and disciplined him instead.",
      "Ruben Amorim was not as forgiving when he saw something he did not like with Rashford in December. The academy graduate was dropped for the Manchester derby and sent on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona offered Rashford the perfect opportunity to breathe life into his career. Most pundits predicted that Rashford would be a success - La Liga is a weaker league and a change of scenery was expected to do him good - and his performance at St. James' Park was a reminder of his ability.",
      "\"I am not surprised,\" Flick said. \"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills and finishing are unbelievable. I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there.",
      "\"In the second half, it was. For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy. He is an important player. When we spoke before the season about what we needed in the team, we felt we needed a player like him. When we had this chance [to sign him], I said we have to do it. He's an outstanding player.\"",
      "Flick added that Rashford's display had represented the \"first step\" and reiterated he needed to make \"the next step.\" The German was hinting at consistency, but Rashford was denied the chance to build momentum due to his lack of punctuality.",
      "Rashford came off the bench against Getafe for the second half to record an assist. His talent has never been in doubt, but Rashford must strive to become a model professional to get the best out of his career.",
      "Amorim's stance on Rashford has ultimately been vindicated by the events of the last week.",
      "Rashford sparkled against Newcastle, a fixture in his home country with millions of British eyes tuned in, but he needs to produce those displays each week.",
      "It was brilliant to see Rashford in full flow against Newcastle, but everyone was thinking: where is this level every weekend? He is capable of so much but has struggled for consistency.",
      "His failure to produce those consistent performances and concerns about his behaviour away from the pitch have prevented him from bridging the gap to become a world-class player.",
      "Consistency is the hardest part of football, however, it shouldn't be difficult to follow club rules. Rashford's lateness shouldn't be blown completely out of proportion - it was only two minutes after all - but it's not the first time he's been disciplined.",
      "He has been given a chance he cannot afford to waste at Barcelona. It would be a huge shame to see him squander an opportunity to kick on in his career because of more discipline issues.",

      "It seems incredulous, as he approaches a year in charge of Manchester United, that Ruben Amorim has failed to win back-to-back Premier League games.",
      "Amorim's record of nine wins from 32 Premier League games is pitiful, but of just as much concern is his failure to carry over the winning formula from those games into the next one.",
      "Even David Moyes, who lasted just 10 months at United - the same length of time Amorim has been in charge - won back-to-back league games on seven occasions during his ill-fated spell in charge.",
      "At Brentford on Saturday lunchtime, Amorim will once again try to string successive league wins together and build on the momentum and confidence gained from Saturday's gritty 2-1 win over Chelsea at a rain-lashed Old Trafford.",
      "Victory at the Gtech Community Stadium in the early kick-off would propel United up to the dizzy heights of a top-five place, before the later games kick off.",
      "More importantly, it would provide tangible proof of the progress Amorim claims to see every day in training, but has yet to be translated into matches in terms of consistency of results and performance.",
      "After every league win under Amorim – and they have been hard to come by, let's be honest – it has been a case of one step forward, two steps back, a false dawn for United's manager, players and fans, with their ongoing failure to make winning a habit.",
      "After a rousing 4-0 win over Everton in only his second game in charge, Amorim delivered his notable “a storm will come” soundbite and it did so three days later, as United went down 2-0 at title-chasing Arsenal.",
      "Despite that defeat, hopes were high among United fans after their late smash-and-grab 2-1 derby win at local rivals Manchester City, but again they capitulated in their next league outing, humiliated 3-0 at home to Bournemouth three days before Christmas.",
      "United had to wait until January 16 for their next win, a 3-1 triumph over Southampton, but reverted to type three days later, going down 3-1 at home to Brighton. Subsequent wins came over Fulham, Ipswich, Leicester and Aston Villa in the final game of the season, but none were backed up by another triumph.",
      "Defender Luke Shaw was honest enough to admit United's lack of consistency has been their biggest failing, not just under Amorim, but his predecessors, and admitted the team have to start putting together winning runs if they want to start challenging towards the top end of the table again.",
      "Shaw, speaking after the Chelsea win, said: “We spoke about it a lot this week - winning this game, winning three points and moving on to the next. The standard we have to set is how we did in the first-half. It's about being consistent and maintaining the levels, not just for 30 minutes or 45 minutes. It's where we need to get to if we want to be a top, top team at the top of the league.",
      "“I felt like we were going to win. I think that's how we have to feel every game. We have to feel like we're going to go into the game and win. That doesn't matter who we play, home or away, we have to have that mentality every game – that we're going to win. We've got to go into games with that mindset.”",
      "Shaw was spot-on in his assessment of United and the mentality they need to develop if they are to become a successful team again. But actions speak louder than words and on Saturday in west London we will discover if Amorim's players can turn rhetoric into results and achieve back-to-back wins under him for the very first time.",

      "Of the five changes made by Ruben Amorin in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea, that of Harry Maguire was perhaps the most curious.",
      "Maguire, restored to United's starting line-up in the Premier League for the first time this season after three sub appearances, was replaced by Leny Yoro after 70 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim gave no specific reason afterwards for the change, but given it was Maguire's first start this season, it is safe to assume he was replaced to protect him from injury.",
      "Amorim has spoken often about the dangers players face in games when they enter the “red zone” and are more susceptible to injury, hence why he makes so many in-game defensive changes.",
      "Given Maguire was immense on Saturday in the centre of United's three-man defence, with Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw equally impressive either side, those within the stadium were understandably puzzled by his withdrawal with 20 minutes plus added time remaining.",
      "But Amorim's thinking in making the switch was clearly to protect Maguire, who has surely now cemented his place in the United manager's first-choice back three, along with De Ligt on his right and Shaw on the left, after his rousing display against Chelsea.",
      "Yoro may have started all four of United's Premier League games until the weekend, but he struggled in the abject 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City the previous weekend, which is why Maguire came back into the starting line-up.",
      "Maguire's towering display, complemented by the equally dogged and disciplined performances of De Ligt and Shaw, makes it unlikely Amorim will want to change his three centre-backs for Saturday lunchtime's trip to Brentford.",
      "One Maguire moment on Saturday, as the swirling rain fell on a filthy night, drew nearly as big a cheer as both United goals. With five minutes to go until half-time, Maguire chased down a 50-50 ball with Chelsea's Joao Pedro and got to it first, sliding across the turf to send it emphatically out of play and clear the danger.",
      "The clearance drew a huge cheer from United fans, with the decibel level increased when Maguire picked himself back up off the turf and purposefully but subtly barged into Pedro as he ran to get back into position, sending a clear message to the Chelsea striker that he was not to be messed with.",
      "The aggressive clearance and belligerent barge into Pedro demonstrated Maguire's confidence on Saturday, something he has struggled with at times during his turbulent six-year United career, but which now looks restored, allowing him to produce his best form.",
      "Maguire's aggressive and focused approach was shared by De Ligt and Shaw, the former making a vital last-ditch clearance to block a cross with Chelsea pushing for an equaliser, the latter making an equally important recovery tackle on Andrey Santos to halt a dangerous breakaway late on.",
      "Before the Chelsea game, Maguire was presented with a framed shirt and pictures to mark his 250th appearance for United, which came with his substitute appearance in the derby loss at City six days earlier.",
      "The milestone underlines Maguire's enduring value and importance to United, despite his much-maligned status outside of the club. As well as his defensive reliability, Maguire has proved effective at the other end of the pitch, plundering 16 goals, including six in the 89th minute or later, three of them winners and one last-gasp equaliser.",
      "At a time when United need stability, aggression and balance at the back, Maguire's return to the side and his return to his imposing best could not have come at a better time as Amorim seeks to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking charge.",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

It's raining and you have to keep your mind focused for every second because in the game, anything can happen. I [am happy I] did this and we are happy because we won. We are working every day for every position, but sometimes you can be unlucky in the game. Sometimes, players [are] doing blocks and it's a foul. It doesn't matter how strong you are, you cannot go to the ball. If someone will be here, you cannot move, it's difficult and in all of the [Premier] League, referees are not saying it is a foul for the disposition, so we have to improve ourselves for everything, for every situation. That's what we are doing every day in the training and today was good.",

      "Legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson used to storm to the back of the club bus and lambaste members of his squad for being too loud while playing video games.",
      "The revelation came courtesy of former United midfielder Paul Scholes, who was speaking on the The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and former Red Devil Nicky Butt.",
      "It began as McGuinness brought up a story told by Old Trafford legend Wayne Rooney. United's all-time top scorer claimed part of the club's astronomical success, during his time at United, was down to the relationships the players forged while playing video games on the team bus.",
      "Several United players would get involved with the game, SOCOM on the PlayStation Portable, including Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea and Wes Brown. Despite Rooney's claims, the gaming sessions didn't go down well with Sir Alex, who was renowned for ruling with an iron fist.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Asked about Rooney's claims, Scholes explained: \"I didn't play those games, it was more the younger lads in the group.",
      "\"The PSP (the PlayStation Portable) and SOCOM, and I can hear them all f*****g shouting from the back of the bus, and it's sort some of shooting game, a war game, and it's all you could hear and it was f*****g annoying.\"",
      "After McGuinness interjected, claiming bus trips to and from games are typically were players engage in card games, and not video games, Scholes added: \"I do remember the boss going down the back of the bus saying, 'Shut the f**k up - because they're all shouting at each other, 'We're on our way to Arsenal away here, what's wrong with you?'\".",
      "Although, he did concede that there may have been some benefit to the group gaming, adding: \"Sometimes it's quite funny as they are having a right go at each other at the back and there is a bit of camaraderie and it's a team game as well.\"",
      "Rooney won five Premier League titles and a Champions League title during his time at United. Speaking on his self-titled podcast the ex-Everton star opened up on how playing the online shooting game helped to get his team-mates talking more.",
      "\"I really believe a big part of our success was playing on the PSP,\" said Rooney. \"It got us communicating more - we used to play it on the plane, on the team bus.",
      "\"It would be me, Rio [Ferdinand], Michael Carrick, John O'Shea, Wes Brown. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go and revive people when they get killed and it was a massive part of our success - ask any of those players, it was brilliant.\"",

      "Manchester United showed this summer that there are occasions when you simply have to sell whether that means the deal is perfect for the club or not.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho needed to be sold in the last transfer window as his relationship with the club was causing more harm than good. Marcus Rashford was similar, albeit to a lesser extent as you feel he may not have burnt all his bridges but, on the balance of evidence, it was still right to move him on.",
      "Looking back now, the Reds made an awful error allowing Scott McTominay to leave the football club. Like Garnacho and Rashford, United benefitted from raking in 'pure profit' on the deal so the books looked a lot rosier once he left for Napoli.",
      "But unlike his former teammates, McTominay was not an issue at United. His previous manager Erik ten Hag even spoke with regret at letting the Scottish international leave.",
      "Ten Hag made a snap judgement that he needed to strengthen defensive midfield but instead of trying to offload Casemiro who remains one of the highest paid players at the club, he sold an asset who is now taking the football world by storm. Incredibly, in his first season in Serie A, McTominay managed to blossom more than anyone expected him to.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "His 12 goals and six assists was comfortably his best season of his professional career and he proved to be the key weapon in Antonio Conte's side as they lifted Serie A. However, his redemption arc was only completed fully on Monday night when he finished 18th in the Ballon d'Or rankings ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Florian Wirtz.",
      "And, let's not forget, there was no United player to be seen anywhere near the Top 30. There was a feeling at the time that the decision to sell McTominay was a short-term decision not thoroughly fleshed out and while nobody could have predicted such a sensational season in Italy, the 28-year-old should be used as a cautionary tale for United moving forward.",
      "History is already threatening to repeat itself under Ruben Amorim with Kobbie Mainoo's future starting to look in serious jeopardy. He requested to leave on loan in the summer and while this was rejected, there has been little sign so far that United will be able to appease him in time for the January window opening.",
      "If Mainoo was to 'do a McTominay', he would be better placed to succeed as he is considerably younger and his form at Old Trafford has not been as inconsistent as his predecessor's. Failing to address Mainoo's concerns would once again open United up to making a short-term decision which ultimately hinders the long-term progression of the club.",
      "Mainoo wants to stay with United hence why he only requested to leave on loan but the persistence of sticking so frigidly to captain Bruno Fernandes could force him away permanently. Nobody can question what Fernandes brings to this team but there is a real possibility that he could leave next summer and if Mainoo is already forced out by then, suddenly United are in a real pickle.",
      "Amorim needs to start blooding in Mainoo as the successor to Fernandes. We know he has the quality to do that and we also know that United is a club built on giving youngsters a chance.",
      "If United are to take anything away from McTominay's success it should be that sometimes, it is better to look within for the next generation rather than selling it off for a quick buck. Mainoo's exit, should that scenario transpire, would show that the Reds really don't learn any lessons, at all.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been told that Barcelona were right to punish him for reportedly turning up late to a pre-match meeting after his behaviour was branded as \"disrespectful\".",
      "The on-loan Manchester United winger started last week on a high with a stunning two-goal performance for the La Liga giants away against Newcastle in the Champions League. However, the 27-year-old was dropped to the bench for Barcelona's 3-0 win over Getafe on Sunday after it was widely reported in Spain that he was two minutes late to a team gathering.",
      "Barcelona are understood to be keen to secure Rashford's services at a bargain price of £26million, while United are hoping to realise closer £35m for the academy graduate. Foster expressed his disappointment over Rashford's latest transgression, despite praising him for turning back the clock with his display against Newcastle.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Rashford got a couple of goals, it was a fantastic performance and he just looked proper. It was old school Marcus Rashford and we love to see it.",
      "\"Then he goes and gets dropped at the weekend because he was late for a team stretching session on the morning of a game. The way that Barcelona have dealt with it, you can tell Hansi Flick doesn't take any s***.\"",
      "Foster later added: \"It's disrespectful and I understand people going, 'Oh, he's [only] a minute or two late,' but it doesn't matter. There are 29 other people there who are waiting for you. If you can't get the basics right, then it's not good enough.\"",
      "Rashford isn't the only player to get on the wrong side of Flick's tough rules, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and, most recently, Raphinha all being punished for similar reasons. Rashford was understood to be due to start the Getafe game on the left side of Barcelona's frontline, but Ferran Torres was chosen instead.",
      "Despite his exclusion, he showed no outward signs of frustration and came on to replace Raphinha at half-time. Rashford impressed on the right side of attack, providing the assist for Dani Olmo's match-winning third goal.",
      "Rashford is on loan at Barca for the season following a fallout with United head coach Ruben Amorim. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa before moving to the Nou Camp.",
      "He has so far made six appearances and netted his first goals against Newcastle last week. No recall clause exists in the loan agreement between United and Barca, with the Catalan club having the option to make the move permanent next summer.",

      "The 21-year-old was denied a return on the hallowed turf on Saturday as the Londoners suffered a 2-1 defeat. Chelsea were forced to play a portion of the match with 10 men after a red card to Robert Sanchez five minutes in before the numerical balance was restored when Casemiro was sent off on the stroke of half-time.",

      "In the report from DSports, they report: “Aware that his place on the roster is not guaranteed, Garnacho contacted Lionel Scaloni directly to find out his situation.”",

      "The creative midfielder won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in Manchester. Eriksen's contract with United officially expired at the end of July and he signed for German club Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Eriksen reflected on his time at the club and suggested recent trophy wins have been underappreciated because of United's successful history.",
      "Eriksen said: \"It probably depends who you ask. If you ask a fan, they want to be back to winning the league every year for the next 20 years like they did... this time of football it is almost impossible, to do that with so many other clubs having that many good players around. It's tough.",
      "\"I think obviously they want to get back to that to being stable as a top club, but even being there, winning the FA Cup and the Carabao in the last two seasons is something that any other club would be proud to have done.",
      "\"Then there is also the size and the image and the feeling at United - it's like it's not good enough. I think hopefully that will change. Even the Carabao [Cup] is a small thing, but at that moment it is a big thing.\"",
      "When asked about whether the opinion of ex-players has an impact on United, Eriksen said: \"You see how big the club is, how much people want to be involved with the club, even on the media attention. I think even now we speak about United here. It's just the power of the club.",
      "\"Obviously the more opinionated, the more feelings towards the club are negative, the tougher it is, because the fans follow their heroes on the TV and it doesn't help the players at the club.",
      "\"At the same time at United, as a footballer, there's always someone who has an opinion on one or the other, but you're just playing football. You try to focus on that bit, and I think United were good at that. The focus was on the game itself and not so much what people say.\"",
      "Roy Keane criticised Luke Shaw after the Manchester derby, claiming he \"gave up\" for Phil Foden's opening goal before suggesting the defender \"has been getting away with murder for years.\".",
      "Speaking after the Chelsea win, Shaw responded: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin. He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it but I think he was right.",
      "\"Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be and I think the manager knows that and the managers who I played under in the past know that.",
      "\"I’m always in the team, I’m always playing, so there must be something the managers [see and] must believe in me. I’m not getting any younger and I need to be consistent, I’ve had lots of ups and downs and it’s about keeping that consistently high level because I know I can do that.",
      "\"And that’s why last week hurt me a lot because I know that’s not my level and I think the criticism is completely understandable, I take it on the chin and listen to it and I move on.\"",

      "Twenty-four years ago, almost to the day, I started covering Manchester United.",
      "The 2001-02 season was to be the last of Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious reign, having announced his intention to retire at the end of that campaign.",
      "A new manager would be installed and a new era would begin, for both United and myself. That was until Fergie's retirement U-turn at Christmas 2001, which saw him stay in charge for another 11 years, and with it for me came numerous run-ins with and bans from the man recognised as arguably the greatest manager of all time.",
      "Since Fergie retired in 2013, another five permanent managers – David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag – have tried and failed to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent boss to try to restore United to the status of champions, a task that seems more onerous than ever following last season's 15th-placed finish, the club's lowest for 51 years.",
      "But one thing I have learned, over nearly a quarter of a century of covering United, following them all over the world – Europe, America, Asia and South Africa – is that their global appeal is as strong as ever, even if they have failed to win the Premier League or Champions League for more than a decade.",
      "The old adage from United fans – 'Hated, adored, never ignored' – has never been more pertinent. In times of success, in times of crisis, no other team in the world comes close to matching United's enduring worldwide appeal, even in lean times such as now, as evidenced by the 75,000 fans who continue to fill Old Trafford every time they play.",
      "Covering a club of United's stature for so long has been a privilege, watching them play week in, week out, getting close up to and on first-name terms with some of the greatest managers and players of the modern era, not always seeing eye-to-eye with them, as is the nature of the business.",
      "I was in the tiny press conference room at United's training ground when Fergie flew into a rage over questions about Juan Sebastian Veron, cutting short his press conference and storming out, but not before delivering the infamous line: “Veron's a f****** great player, youse are f****** idiots!”",
      "Fergie may have been known for his legendary 'hairdryer' treatment, but there was a lighter side to him, such as the time the Mirror carried a front page story about the team's training sessions being filmed by a spy plane flying overhead.",
      "When I asked Fergie about the plane at the next press conference, he burst into laughter. “I saw you flying it,” joked Fergie, putting his hands upside down to impersonate a pair of flying goggles. “I could see you up there in your Biggles hat and goggles. Biggles McDonnell, Biggles of the Mirror!”",
      "Fergie's successor, Moyes, banned me from press conferences because I refused to stop leaking his starting line-ups, sometimes five or six hours before games, until he was dismissed before the end of his first season in charge of United.",
      "On the pitch, including Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, friendlies and pre-season matches, I reckon I have racked up more than 1,000 games covering United, and been privileged to be at some momentous occasions, including the 2008 Champions League final penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, where the relentless rain made it feel like home for the travelling United fans.",
      "Other highlights include United's epic derby duels with local rivals City, notably the 4-3 win for Fergie's side in 2009, which came courtesy of a dramatic 90th minute winner from Michael Owen, and not forgetting Wayne Rooney's stunning bicycle kick to beat the Blues 2-1 at the Theatre of Dreams two years later.",
      "I was also privileged to report on Rooney's United debut, back in 2004, when the then raw 18-year-old forward, who had taken Euro 2004 by storm, announced himself as a Red with a sublime hat-trick in a 6-2 win over Fenerbahce at Old Trafford, the first goals that would lead to him becoming the club's all-time leading scorer.",
      "As well as covering the highs for United over the past 24 years, there have also been some major lows, not least their 6-1 home defeat to City in 2011, the season in which the Blues went on to win the title from Fergie's men on goal difference on the final day.",
      "There were two Champions League final defeats to Pep Guardiola's peerless Barcelona and, more recently, with United mired in an ongoing identity crisis, many crushing losses, such as the 7-0 defeat to arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield two years ago under Ten Hag.",
      "But there is a reason United remain one of the biggest draws in world football, even when they have been unable to compete for major trophies in the past decade, and that is because of their rich history, stretching back to the Munich tragedy and the rebirth of the team under Sir Matt Busby, to the unprecedented era of success overseen by Ferguson.",
      "I hope to do the same as I begin this new chapter.",

      "\"Seven!\" shrieked the United supporters at the number of added minutes in the second half. They celebrated the additional nine in the first half, back when victory seemed a formality. Yet this is a club that feels like it is obliged to quicken the heart rate of its supporters.",
      "\"Oh United, we love you,\" roared their supporters as the clock ticked towards the 97th minute. Amorim paced nervously around the technical area, glanced at his staff and issued the odd instruction. United held on.",
      "This has to be the turning point in United's season. They were better than Chelsea in every conceivable department, from the stands to the pitch. United supporters belted out 'Take Me Home' with more gusto than ever since its introduction shortly before kick-off. The players fed off the atmosphere, enhanced by the evening kick-off time.",
      "United used the Mancunian rain to their advantage. Benjamin Sesko's flick on skidded perfectly into the path of Bryan Mbeumo and Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez fell into the trap. The Chelsea analysts had issues connecting to the network. It was soon Sanchez who malfunctioned.",
      "The Stretford End was so buoyed by Sanchez's fifth-minute red card they aired Amorim's chant before United scored. Bruno Fernandes got the goal a mere nine minutes later.",
      "There was more biblical rain at Old Trafford but Amorim's ark has not flooded. He will not be the second Premier League manager to be sacked this season. That is bound to be Graham Potter.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was United's catalyst in his best game yet for his new club. He went close to scoring before Sanchez's expulsion and earned a standing ovation when Matheus Cunha was ready to replace him. Amorim had a rethink and Mbeumo stayed on. He elicited a second round of applause when he eventually made way minutes later.",
      "The winger's importance is such that Fernandes, usually in his element ordering new teammates around, was borderline deferential towards Mbeumo during the electric first half. Mbeumo's name was chanted by the Stretford End as he headed back to the dugout, his route doubling as a lap of honour. Amorim clasped hands and patted his head.",
      "United fans put their hands together twice for Maguire, too. He was presented with a commemorative shirt to mark his 250th appearance before the game and the United defence was better off with him back on his first Premier League start of the campaign. Maguire only made way midway through the second half to manage his workload, a costly change.",
      "This was an evening United supporters could scarcely have believed when the teamsheets were printed. Amorim picked seven defensive players in a must-win home game. Alas, United seldom defended. Their first half was one of their most accomplished and pleasing until Casemiro reignited a contest against a seemingly condemned Chelsea.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui embarked on his own celebration after Casemiro made it 2-0 and received a hug from Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes. More bonhomie seemed inevitable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was instructed to warm up after Casemiro was booked in the 17th minute. Mainoo was the only substitute limbering up, a sure sign Amorim and his staff knew Casemiro would not last the duration.",
      "Casemiro has walked a tightrope before and got away with it. Erik ten Hag hooked him at half-time against Luton two seasons ago after he was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card. Casemiro could not hold his nerve until half-time as he cynically halted Andrey Santos' getaway.",
      "Fernandes' position has been disputed regularly and here he was arriving late to connect with Patrick Dorgu's header. The linesman called it impeccably by keeping his flag down as only Fernandes' arm was offside. A Chelsea analyst, optimistic that they had a case for offside, smacked his hand against his forehead upon the final outcome.",
      "This was another inspirational effort from Fernandes. Shortly before his removal, he embarked on a superhuman run and unleashed a testing shot that was parried by Filip Jorgensen. Fernandes immediately turned to the Stretford End and implored them to continue with their backing. They obliged.",
      "Fernandes was back on the pitch at full-time, pointing out to Manuel Ugarte and Patrick Dorgu where they went wrong. The United captain's mentality remains unmatched.",
      "United have rarely had a better first 20 minutes on their own patch. They were a man up and soon a goal up. Then Cole Palmer became Chelsea's third substitution, enforced by injury. Palmer chucked his gloves on the floor, claimed a coat and skulked down the tunnel. \"City reject,\" crowed the United supporters. Palmer re-emerged with a bag of ice against his thigh.",
      "Only a handful of former United players are booed on their return at Old Trafford and it cannot be a coincidence that four of them are Argentinian. Alejandro Garnacho copped it before kick-off and the Stretford End dusted off its old ditty about Carlos Tevez that starts with \"Who's that t**t from Argentina.\" The Chelsea contingent vainly chanted \"Viva Garnacho\".",
      "Garnacho was ordered to warm up in the 53rd minute and received an embrace from Kobbie Mainoo on his approach to the Stretford End. Garnacho had the nerve to run past the corner flag and observe some caustic sign language.",
      "Garnacho's bleached barnet was distinguishable before he pulled his hood up when he emerged for kick-off. The focus was soon off him when Sanchez upended Mbeumo. Garnacho never got off the bench.",
      "He stayed in the cold.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United do not have an outright number one goalkeeper.",
      "United signed Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day for £18.2million, including add-ons, and the 23-year-old was on the bench for the Manchester derby.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "United allowed Onana to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan earlier this month, leaving them without a clear and obvious first-choice 'keeper.",
      "When asked whether Bayindir was the new United number one, Amorim replied: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko is yet to break his duck for United after five games. Sesko made his full league debut in the 3-0 loss at City after failing to score in two starts for Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "The 22-year-old was the tenth outfield player to take a penalty in the 12-11 shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, though he was suffering from cramp at the end of the 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko said during the international break he needed time at United. The former RB Leipzig striker is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United before he joined Napoli on loan.",
      "United have had the most attempts at goal in the Premier League this season, have hit the woodwork more times than any other team and Bruno Fernandes has created more chances than any other player.",
      "Amorim acknowledged that Sesko was too isolated in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Not even two years have passed since Alejandro Garnacho scored a sensational overhead kick to power Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over Everton.",
      "The strike was a goal of season winner as soon as it crashed into the net and at that stage it seemed the winger was destined to have a key role for years to come at Old Trafford.",
      "Six months later he scored in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City and his future at United seemed as bright as his wonder goal.",
      "Yet this weekend he will trot out at Old Trafford in the blue of Chelsea having found himself ostracised by Ruben Amorim at United. He's gone from being talked about as having United parallels with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, to being discarded having trained with a 'bomb squad'.",
      "Amorim did not even want to talk about him in his pre-match press conference and it is clear the head coach did not value the Argentina international, who criticised the manager's decision to omit him from the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "That was the final straw in a tormented relationship between the pair and from that moment on it was a case of when the 21-year-old would leave, not if.",
      "Chelsea were long-term admirers and swooped in the closing days of the transfer window. The Blues considered the £40million fee a bargain price given Garnacho's ability, experience and high ceiling, and wanted additional competition for Jamie Gittens on the left flank.",
      "He's made only two substitute appearances since his move but could start against United. Blues boss Enzo Maresca has spoken positively of Garnacho and he played a part in Moises Caicedo's goal against Brentford last time out.",
      "The questions over his attitude while at United are not a concern at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea reporter for Football London, Bobby Vincent, pointed to the comparison between Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who spent last season on loan at the club from United, as evidence of the Blues being able to get the best out of mercurial players.",
      "\"Like all things, it (his attitude) would have been considered when Chelsea were initially exploring a move for him,\" he said. \"Maresca worked with Jadon Sancho last season, who had similar complaints surrounding him, but from what I understand, Sancho worked really well during his time at Chelsea and the club were impressed with the winger's work ethic and professionalism.\"",
      "Yet Garnacho still has some work to do to win over the supporters, with Vincent adding: \"The fans are very much still split on his signing. It seems, though, most of them were encouraged by his cameo in Brentford. He has plenty to prove to the fans - let's put it that way.\"",
      "He will have plenty to prove to himself, too, particularly on his return to Manchester on Saturday evening.",
      "One man who knew him well coming through the ranks at Old Trafford was former United Under-21 boss Neil Wood.",
      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" said Wood, when speaking to the MEN earlier this year. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "We will see who has the last word come Saturday night.",

      "Ratcliffe has been defensive of Amorim's record at United, claiming in March that the Portuguese was doing \"a great job\". Amorim has won only eight of his 31 Premier League games in charge.",
      "Amorim was reassured by Ratcliffe that his position is still secure. Amorim is under contract at United until the summer of 2027.",
      "The United head coach also discussed the state of play at the club with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. Amorim opined that United \"are playing well until the boxes\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract!\" Amorim joked. \"No, it’s normal things just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project.",
      "\"He said many times this is my first season. For me, it’s not. But normal things. I spoke with him, with Omar, with Jason, just trying to see all the data around the team. A normal meeting and we had several. But in this moment, it’s normal people pay attention to that.",
      "\"This is the club with the most pressure in the world. We want to win and, again, you can say whatever. I think last year I was very critical of the way we play. I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes, we need to be more clinical, the rest we are improving compared to last year, we are in a better place.",
      "\"We need to win. We lost against Arsenal and we lost against City. Here, losing especially in the beginning after last year, is a problem.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and to analyse the next game and to prepare different things. I think we are playing well until we reach the boxes. If you see the number of shots, the XG, all these things are good, but you don’t score it doesn’t mater. You don’t win games.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games, we just have to maintain the way we are playing but improving on the opponent’s box and our box.",
      "\"Especially against Chelsea. When they cross they have more guys inside the box and we suffer a little bit against Fulham. We work a lot during the week to be better on that.",
      "\"It’s always the same cycle. To analyse what we did wrong at the weekend and to improve the next week.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United \"complicate our lives every time\" after the win against Chelsea.",
      "United were handed an advantage just minutes into the contest against Chelsea when goalkeeper Roberto Sanchez was sent off.",
      "Sanchez fouled Bryan Mbeumo and received his marching orders. Bruno Fernandes then opened the scoring for United and Casemiro extended the lead with a headed goal in the 37th minute.",
      "United were cruising to the interval against 10-man Chelsea, but Casemiro was shown a second yellow card just before the break. Chelsea set up a nervous end to the game when Trevoh Chalobah scored with 10 minutes remaining, but United defended bravely to secure a 2-1 victory.",
      "Speaking at his post-match press conference, Amorim said of the win: \"It was really important. I think we deserved it. But we complicate our lives every time. I think we started the game really well, with the aggression and showing the opponent we were there.",
      "\"Of course, the sending off for the goalkeeper helped us a lot, but we were in control, scored two goals. And with everything going well, we complicated it with the sending off.",
      "\"The second half, I think we managed well, but in the end like the last 15 minutes was tough for us. They scored a goal, we suffered together and we managed to win.",
      "\"I think the players showed that [desire], but we also showed when everything is going well, we do something to make it difficult. But again, just the way we start the game, the first and second ball, I remember when we scored the first one we had many situations, three against one, three against two, goalkeeper outside of the box, with the last pass we are not being perfect in that moment.",
      "\"And that can help us a lot to control the games and to win games, but we suffer together in the end and that was a good thing. If you look at the game, we deserved to win.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he saw the \"aggression\" that he discussed in his pre-match press conference and said: \"I think if we try to remember the game, you can feel it, especially in the beginning. It's 11 vs 11 and I don't remember the big player we did. It's not about that in this moment.",
      "\"It's about the second ball, the first ball, the aggression and speed. Even Casa' with the sending off, he was really aggressive. Of course, he needs to do better in that moment, but we show today we wanted to win really, really bad.\"",
      "When asked about complicating the game, Amorim responded: \"That they [the players] are trying to do things a little bit too much, making a tackle that maybe we shouldn't? It's hard to say, because that is the pressure.",
      "\"The guy [Casemiro] has five Champions League. I feel more pressure in some young guys sometimes. But maybe it's because Casemiro cares. We score one and he has that tackle.",
      "\"And then they had maybe one time that they passed half of the pitch and we want to win the ball right away. So I think sometimes it's not the pressure, they wanted too much in that moment. That is not a bad thing.\"",
      "Amorim said on Friday he would not change formation even if the Pope asked him to. \"I was a joking,\" laughed Amorim. \"And you like it guys, so don't complain. You love it that way. Let's try to win the next one and I will give you another one.\"",

      "Amorim has used the 3-4-2-1 system in all 47 matches he has taken charge of at United but the team have won only eight out of 31 in the Premier League.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited United's Carrington training complex on Thursday but there was no puff of white smoke. Ratcliffe reassured Amorim after a galling start to the season in which United have won one of their five matches and were humiliatingly eliminated from the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim will continue to use the 3-4-2-1 system he swears by in United's Premier League home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday night and clarified he does not intend to change United's shape now.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim replied when asked if the formation was mentioned with Ratcliffe. \"No one, not even the Pope will change… This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.",
      "\"But I will change the system, there will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, 'you need to change the system' and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing: this will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way.",
      "\"But it will change. So, I hope to have the time to change! But it will change.\"",
      "Amorim expressed encouragement at United's performance progression, citing their second-place status for the expected goals metric. United are first for most attempts at goal and efforts that have hit the woodwork in the Premier League.",
      "However, United have scored one goal from open play in six hours in the league so far this term. Apart from Bryan Mbeumo's second-half strike against Burnley, United have scored two own goals and Bruno Fernandes converted an added-time penalty to beat Burnley.",
      "Champions Liverpool have won all five of their league and Champions League games with a goal scored in the last ten minutes or in added time. Amorim feels Liverpool have the belief United are lacking.",
      "\"I think it's everything,\" he opined. \"It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. And sometimes, what we call luck is the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"So I think it's Liverpool. It's winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling. And sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "So, we need to change that, but it's just with wins. I can do whatever. They can do whatever. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley. We are good in the game and then we take the draw.",
      "\"All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So, we work on that during the week to improve for the next.\"",
      "Amorim was fleetingly linked with a return to Lisbon as Benfica manager early in the week. Reports in Portugal suggested Benfica presidential candidate João Noronha Lopes was keen on bringing Amorim in to replace Bruno Lage, who was sacked after the Champions League defeat to Qarabag in midweek.",
      "Instead, incumbent Benfica president Rui Costa appointed Amorim's mentor and former United manager, Jose Mourinho, as Lage's replacement. Former Sporting coach Amorim clarified that there was no contact with Benfica and that whenever he leaves United he will require a break.",
      "\"No guys, no contact,\" Amorim added. \"I'm Manchester United manager. Until something changes, and after that, for sure, if it's next month, tomorrow, in ten years, I will rest because I deserve it.",
      "\"So, no contact, not so ever. And then Mourinho is there. So guys, if you want, you will have fun!\"",

      "That fact could not be demonstrated more beautifully than by the example of Dembele, who appeared to be wasted potential following his departure from Barcelona but has instead scooped the shiniest individual gong in world football.",

      "The French international has started this season strongly too, scoring three and assisting two in four league games so far and at 23, can only get better. So much better that Liverpool are already said to be sniffing around as they scout for a long-term replacement for Mo Salah.",
      "Bayern have won just one Champions League in the past 12 years and should they double that tally this season, you get the sense that the former Crystal Palace winger will be key to that. And then there’s the small matter of France at the World Cup.",

      "There is nothing like a Barcelona midfielder to whet the nostalgic appetite but while plenty of have been dubbed the new Andres Iniesta or Xavi, Pedri seems the likeliest candidate to actually reach that level.",
      "Against Newcastle, he put in a masterclass of a midfield performance and while the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha may score the goals, Pedri ensures the team behind them ticks along nicely.",
      "But, Pedri need only ask Iniesta and Xavi when it comes to midfield players not being fairly represented at the Ballon d’Or. Rodri, Luka Modric and Kaka are the only midfielders to win it this century but what does work in Pedri’s favour is that he does not have Lionel Messi blocking his path.",

      "Rashford said: “I think some of it goes back to the [coronavirus] pandemic. I was just trying to use my voice to make sure that kids weren’t going hungry, because I know exactly how it feels.",
      "“For some reason, that seemed to rub certain people the wrong way. It seems like they’ve been waiting for me to have a human moment so they can point the finger and say, ‘See? See who he really is?’ – listen, I’m not a perfect person.",

      "It’s only September and we’ve all already got so much wrong about this season, from expecting an actual real-life title race like damn fools, to expecting the promoted teams to just meekly surrender as has become the style of our times.",
      "We feared for Bournemouth, like massive idiots, we thought Graham Potter just needed a pre-season, like even massiver idiots. We thought Man United would be a bit less sh*t this time.",
      "We thought Viktor Gyokeres would either fire Arsenal to the title or flop hard and the awkward bugger isn’t going to do either of those things.",
      "And let’s not even start on that ‘Chelsea title challenge’ we all talked about after the Trump World Cup.",
      "As always, you can see our pre-season predictions in full here. Laugh hard.",
      "",
      "So angry about this one already. Can’t fault Liverpool, can we? They’re doing their bit. Could hardly have looked more vulnerable if they’d tried, could they? But they’ve still accidentally won all their games despite falling entirely asleep the very moment they take a 2-0 lead.",
      "Meanwhile nobody else can even be bothered. Mikel Arteta is as timid as a tiny mouse with a suspiciously full head of hair, Pep Guardiola is cosplaying Jose Mourinho sufferball for reasons we simply cannot fathom, and Chelsea… well, we’ve got more to say about them later.",
      "Look, it’s obviously very early to be writing off the entire title race, and the main reason people are keen to do so now is in the hope they can call Liverpool bottle jobs later. They are objectively the worst very good team in Premier League history, and a lot of the teams who are better than them at this stage didn’t actually go on to win the league.",
      "But with everyone else shambling about to one extent or other and the sure and certain knowledge that Liverpool are only going to get better as they all get to know each other, it does appear like the best opportunity anyone else had to knock Liverpool off their perch this season was in these early weeks.",
      "It hasn’t happened, either through Liverpool dropping points or anyone else looking much like taking advantage if and when they do. And now it probably won’t happen. The sheer extent to which Arsenal already appear certain to finish second is truly extraordinary. World-class commitment to the bit.",
      "",
      "He is already the Premier League’s most fascinating player. Incredibly awkward, almost sarcastically un-Arsenal, and entirely incapable of fashioning or creating anything for himself, which means that in the big games where Arteta’s instinct is always going to be safety-first, Gyokeres isn’t going to get a kick. Like he didn’t against United, like he didn’t against Liverpool, like he didn’t against City.",
      "",
      "But what Gyokeres does have is an uncanny ability to stick the ball in the net. So in the games where Arteta takes off the handbrake – which across the course of the season will be a far higher percentage of games than has been the case in Arsenal’s undeniably difficult start – he’ll score a whole bunch of goals.",
      "It won’t stop people calling him a massive flop, because a lot of people seem weirdly invested in the idea of Gyokeres as a massive flop. The discourse around him is very strange, perhaps because he is such an awkward-looking player to watch. Nothing about the way he plays football screams £60m superstar in the way it does with, say, a Hugo Ekitike.",
      "He’s going to score loads of goals against all the teams that aren’t brilliant. So he’s not going to be a massive flop. Even now, the only Premier League player with more goals this season than Gyokeres is literally Erling Haaland.",
      "He is, though, going to get called a massive flop because he ‘hasn’t delivered in the big games’. He’s going to be labelled a ‘flat-track bully’ (like literally here). He’s going to be told he hasn’t done enough to shift the needle, because obviously there was no evidence last season that Arsenal might have benefited from someone to consistently score goals against teams like Bournemouth or West Ham or Newcastle or Everton or Brentford or Nottingham Forest or Aston Villa or Brighton or Crystal Palace or Fulham or, well, you get the idea with that.",
      "Above all, though, he’s going to be labelled a flop despite scoring 23 Premier League goals.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola, we owe you an apology, we weren’t really familiar with your game. We should have been, because he’s been performing minor Premier League miracles for a good while now with Bournemouth.",
      "But this is surely his greatest trick yet. Having built last season’s considerable success on the strength of his back five, Iraola has now seen four of that five stolen away by assorted members of European football’s collection of big bastards. Huijsen went to Real Madrid. Zabarnyi to PSG. Kerkez to Liverpool. And, to a lesser extent, Kepa to Arsenal.",
      "That was more than enough to place Bournemouth in the large pile of similarly asset-stripped smaller clubs about whom we had significant fear.",
      "We should have had more faith, because what Iraola has done is simply instantly build another brilliant team built on another excellent defence.",
      "A Spurs team that has scored at least twice in each of its four other Premier League games this season could barely muster a meaningful chance across 90 minutes where the sheer extent of the Cherries’ total control of proceedings was almost eerie.",
      "And that was no one-off fluke. Only Liverpool have more points after five games than a team that should by rights have been thoroughly broken by the events of the summer.",
      "And only Liverpool have beaten them, after a ding-dong opening-night battle at Anfield. Bournemouth conceded four goals that night, but have shipped only one since and an upcoming fixture list featuring Leeds, Fulham, Palace and Forest between now and the end of next month offers serious scope for continued defying of Premier League gravity.",
      "Right now they are Champions League-bound and it doesn’t even feel daft.",
      "",
      "Sure, it was often very bad indeed in those closing months of last season, but patience was needed. Potter is a details man, who needed to imprint his ideas and methods on to a squad not without its charms.",
      "As it turns out, he didn’t need that at all. What Graham Potter in fact needed was a time machine to go back to the day he took the Chelsea job and punch his past self squarely in the face and talk him out of committing career suicide.",
      "We’re almost certain there is now no chance Potter can save himself at West Ham specifically. It’s just too f*cked. What’s really wild, though, given where he was just a few short years ago is that we’re really not at all sure now how he goes about saving his career at all.",
      "Seriously, think about it. When the inevitable happens and the axe falls and West Ham appoint Gary O’Neil or Nuno to try and do just enough to avoid the ignominy of relegation, where does Potter go next? What’s his next step? Who takes a chance on him, and would he be at all interested in the sort of club that would do that anyway?",
      "He might be even more screwed in this equation than West Ham themselves, and that’s a club currently in some of the deepest despair we’ve ever seen, with a fanbase apparently only now able to agree on what they don’t want rather than what they do.",
      "That’s especially inconvenient because among those things are a terrible stadium and terrible owners that they appear rather stuck with.",
      "If you ask us, it all started to go wrong the moment the entire club tried for some reason we’ve never really understood to gaslight us all into pretending their previous much less soulless stadium had always been widely known as the Boleyn Ground and that nobody had ever called it Upton Park, actually.",
      "Seriously, why did they do that? What was the point?",
      "",
      "They won the Club World Cup! And to a less noteworthy degree the Europa Conference! They bought a load of good players again! And sold a lot of rubbish at very decent prices! But still forgot to sign an actual goalkeeper! Which is costing them really badly! And forcing Enzo Maresca to make the single worst collection of substitutions in any Premier League match ever!",
      "Ah, well. An undignified scrap with Spurs et al for fourth it shall be, then. And probably a managerial change as well. He’s just too bald.",
      "",
      "The Barclays giveth and the Barclays taketh away. While the Our League Gods have again, in their infinite wisdom, not deemed it fit to grant us a Proper Title Race they are seemingly going to grant us a good old-fashioned relegation ding-dong after all that promoted-and-immediately-relegated drudgery of the last two years.",
      "Two things were required to make this happen. Some of the Settled Seventeen looking a bit cack, and the promoted trio showing signs of competence.",
      "Happily, we have both. Even Burnley haven’t been entirely wretched, and along with Leeds and Sunderland they have now amassed 19 points from 15 games at 1.27 per game. It’s already pretty much a third of the total points tally the promoted-relegated trio managed last season at 0.57 points per game.",
      "Lovely stuff. And then throw in the catastrophic awfulness of Wolves, West Ham and even Aston Villa, with high potential for your Brentfords or even Nottingham Forests to get themselves into strife and we’ve got ourselves a proper scrap for survival.",
      "",
      "Worth its own section for the sheer scale of its wrongness. But accustomed as we’d come to seeing promoted sides struggle horribly and armed with the fact that Sunderland looked like a textbook example of a team committing the disastrous error of accidentally winning the play-offs at least a year too early in their process, it was easy to imagine they might have a Southampton-esque tilt at the Premier League’s ultimate wooden spoon.",
      "Technically they still might, of course, but we’re not afraid to admit that on the balance of probabilities a Sunderland team that has managed eight points from its first five games will probably manage to scrape together at least another four from the remaining 33.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure what there is now, because at least two members of the supposed six have been clowning about for a good while now, but what we have all been given is a reminder that you can’t just elevate anyone else you feel like into that Big X territory on the back of a couple of good seasons in and around the top six.",
      "It was a lesson that should have been learned with Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester and one that is now being delivered again by Unai Emery’s Aston Villa.",
      "Newcastle are a slightly different matter because there is still the potential for them to work out means and ways of spending themselves into elite security, but they definitely aren’t there yet.",
      "It really is worth remembering that for all their impeccable banter-club credentials, Spurs’ elevation alongside the more obviously compelling Man City gatecrashing of the old Big Four was based on far, far more than a mere couple of decent seasons on the pitch.",
      "We’ve also just now noticed that Spurs now have exactly 1961 Premier League points, which is nice for them.",
      "",
      "Turns out they are just as bad, except against teams that make a series of unfathomably stupid decisions in the opening 21 minutes.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains really quite alarmingly committed to a formation that doesn’t work with a squad that doesn’t suit it, and is now openly goading the dafties he appointed him into sacking him if they don’t like it. Which they won’t because they’re desperately trying to save face themselves.",
      "We now fully expect to see Man United 14th by the November break, Amorim still egging the board on to sack him after every defeat and people still pointing with increased derangement at the ‘underlying numbers’ that supposedly point to corners being turned and a recovery that will quite obviously never come.",
      "West Ham have reached the stage where anger is in danger of giving way to apathy. It’s a club where absolutely everything seems broken beyond repair.",
      "Graham Potter has been nothing short of a disaster as West Ham manager; who will drink from the poisoned chalice next?",
      "Mohamed Salah was ‘overlooked’ and ‘snubbed’ as the best footballer on the planet was NOT the Liverpool man!",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or.",
      "Quite why Russell Martin was appointed by Rangers in the first place is a mystery; he has been a predictable disaster.",
      "Mikel Arteta is defended by Arsenal fans while we have an expose of Liverpool’s rewritten history."

      "We’re five games into the Premier League season and some of the fears over big summer signings are being realised.",
      "All of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal appear to have made striker blunders, while Chelsea have signed a downgrade and Newcastle can’t get better than Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is a ‘flat-track bully’ \nThe major concern having watched Gyokeres plunder a gazillion goals for Sporting was whether he could match or even get near those goalscoring heights against superior opposition in the Premier League. The stats are damning.",
      "He’s scored three in five games so far, two against newly promoted Leeds and the third against a Nottingham Forest side whose manager had been in place for about four minutes. Not only has he failed to score against Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City, he’s accrued an xG of 0.0 in those three games.",
      "Mikel Arteta says Gyokeres is “trying his best”, bless him, and we assume the Arsenal boss will continue to insist a lack of service is to blame until Kai Havertz returns to fitness and replaces the Swede for these big games.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens is a Noni Madueke downgrade\nIt doesn’t say much for Gittens’ standing five games into his career at Chelsea that at no point amid Enzo Maresca’s irrational substitutions against Manchester United on Saturday was there any great dismay at him failing to turn to the £48.5m winger to get them back into the game. At least Alejandro Garnacho was on the verge of being introduced before being snubbed in favour of Tyrique George and Malo Gusto.",
      "He looks like a man who doesn’t truly believe he should be there, in many ways the antithesis of Madueke, who may not have set the world alight at Stamford Bridge, but never lacked for confidence. And after his fine start at Arsenal, it feels as though Chelsea have simply nurtured, developed and improved one winger to aid their Premier League rivals and replaced him with another at the start of that journey, very possibly without the same self-belief to take those positive steps forward.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz is too lightweight\nWhile we totally understand why he’s been targeted and have absolutely jumped on the bandwagon, Wirtz has not been half as bad as the Liverpool-baiting media and fan responses to his performances would suggest.",
      "As much as anything, we all just need a stick to beat the Premier League champions-elect with right now, and much of the criticism is based around the fear of just how f***ed everyone else is when he and Liverpool actually start playing well. We’re getting the jabs in while we still can.",
      "A common slam is how easily he appears to get knocked off the ball. And he does look lightweight, but we are now all looking for examples which we’re guessing could be found by analysing the footage of plenty of Premier League No.10s. We don’t particularly remember Phil Foden or James Maddison bullying their way through opposition challenges, for example.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the new Rasmus Hojlund\nThere has perhaps been no greater sign of just how far the Manchester United stock has fallen than their fans batting away criticism of their new £67m striker after he was hooked at half-time in the victory over Chelsea by extolling the virtues of an Andy Carroll-esque flick-on from a long punt up the pitch.",
      "That was one of eight touches for Sesko in a half of football against 10 men in which he completed three passes, had no shots and didn’t attempt a dribble. He’s had five shots in 207 minutes of Premier League football. We know what you’re thinking – if only he was getting the service. Sound familiar?",
      "",
      "Liverpool don’t need Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak\nAs great headaches for a manager go, the struggle to choose between a striker who’s already got four goals and an assist and the most expensive Premier League signing of all time is a real doozy.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Slot “has to play” Ekitike after his fine start to life at Anfield, but although we would all revel in Isak continuing to watch Liverpool games rather than playing in them after escaping that whole-season reality on deadline day, Slot also sort of has to play him, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze is not a left winger\nWe don’t suppose Arsenal fans care all that much which left winger changed the game and secured victory in their Champions League opener before scoring an equaliser against their title rivals in the very next game, but you would have got pretty long odds on that player being Gabriel Martinelli at the start of the summer transfer window. Nico Williams or Rodrygo may have been more likely.",
      "Martinelli wouldn’t still be at Arsenal if they had received a good enough offer for the Brazilian, but still looks like their best bet on the left wing over Eze, very simply because Martinelli is a left winger and Eze is not.",
      "Arteta should accept Havertz-esque defeat now.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga isn’t worth £55m\nOur suggestion that Elanga may not be worth £55m to anyone else but is to Newcastle was predicated on him being able to replicate something similar to what he did for Nottingham Forest last season for his new club.",
      "Having started the first two games of the season he’s taken up a spot on the bench for the last three, which makes us wonder just how good a right winger Newcastle need to sign in order to one day displace Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens is not a No.1\nAsked whether Altay Bayindir is now his No.1 goalkeeper having started every Premier League game so far this season, Amorim insisted “nobody has a place that is his place”. He may very well have said the same thing had Manchester United signed Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, but either one of them would now definitely be in the starting XI.",
      "Bayindir may grow into the role and prove himself capable, but no right-minded United fan will have any real hope of that being the case, and they may currently be wondering why their club has spent 18 million precious pounds on a back-up goalkeeper who we can only assume is at best a minor improvement on the man currently tending goal.",
      "West Ham have reached the stage where anger is in danger of giving way to apathy. It’s a club where absolutely everything seems broken beyond repair.",
      "Graham Potter has been nothing short of a disaster as West Ham manager; who will drink from the poisoned chalice next?",
      "Mohamed Salah was ‘overlooked’ and ‘snubbed’ as the best footballer on the planet was NOT the Liverpool man!",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or.",
      "Quite why Russell Martin was appointed by Rangers in the first place is a mystery; he has been a predictable disaster.",
      "Mikel Arteta is defended by Arsenal fans while we have an expose of Liverpool’s rewritten history."

      "Scott McTominay is officially the 18th best player in world football. He’s better than Jude Bellingham. He’s better than Erling Haaland. He’s better than Virgil van Dijk. He’s sure as sh*t better than any Manchester United player.",
      "Perhaps Rio Ferdinand should reflect on how after one season away from Old Trafford, he’s better than Declan Rice and only slightly worse than Harry Kane, who may not have been the pairing to cure all of United’s ills after all.",
      "In fairness to Ferdinand, he was against United selling McTominay to Napoli, although his steady Eddie reasoning hasn’t aged well after the Scot was named Serie A MVP in his debut season under Antonio Conte.",
      "“I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player,” Ferdinand said. “But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher.",
      "“They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that. It really doesn’t sit well with me.",
      "“With McTominay you know what you’re getting. He might not always be a nine out of 10 but invariably he’s a solid seven out of 10 and sometimes he will be an eight out of 10 and get you a goal.”",
      "But the pundit recently fell into a trap which has claimed many a Manchester United stakeholder in the last decade or so, in claiming that issues can be solved by spending a couple of hundred million on two very good footballers.",
      "“I honestly think and I’m convinced that if Man United would have got Harry Kane and Declan Rice in that window, they’re in a different place now. It goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment I think because they’re two top pros.”",
      "There’s no doubt that Kane and Rice improve Manchester United, but Tottenham finished eighth in Kane’s last season for them despite his 30 goals in that campaign. Rice led West Ham to the Conference League title but a 14th-place Premier League finish. There’s only so much one man can do for a football club failing to meet expectations, or in this specific Ferdinand-imagined case, what two men can do at Manchester United.",
      "And based on the admittedly arbitrary Ballon d’Or ranking of all footballers in every position which sees McTominay placed between Rice in 27th and Kane in 13th, neither of those potential saviours would have had anything like the impact for the Red Devils that they’re currently having at Arsenal and Bayern Munich respectively.",

      "Ex-Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay has called Rasmus Hojlund in order to persuade his former team-mate to join him at Napoli, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool star Andy Robertson has fired a dig at Premier League rivals Manchester United, who are said to have made a mistake with Scott McTominay.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are interested in signing Man Utd centre-back Lisandro Martinez this summer as well as Alejandro Garnacho, according to reports.",

      "Then they triumphed again without even playing.",
      "There is already an air of inevitability about Liverpool, even if this was their first victory since April without a winner scored earlier than the 83rd minute. It was a different challenge to defend a lead confidently secured within half an hour but one they still passed with relative comfort.",

That it was ultimately all three, delivered away from home to a relegation rival with ease, is a heartening sign that Farke has learned from his chastening Premier League experiences thus far.",
      "“I think it was crucial that we didn’t dwell on this and didn’t lose the confidence,” he said of the preventable early Wolves goal. “You could sometimes feel sorry for yourself, especially in an away game, after such a heartbreaking final minute in the last game. But we just kept believing in what we wanted to do and in our game plan, our processes.”",

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Even after five wins from five games there is a small yet irritatingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Finally managed to win a game without needing a dramatic late goal against Everton, but didn’t quite put to bed those ‘weirdly flaky when 2-0 up’ allegations, either.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what four defeats in the opening five games will do to you after a summer where little went right for West Ham.",
      "Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. Then any hint of renewed optimism was dashed by grim  flaw-exposing defeats to Tottenham and Crystal Palace.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Paul Merson has made a prediction relating to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, while Wayne Rooney has raised one “big question” about the game vs Chelsea.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has made three significant decisions for Manchester United’s game against Chelsea on Saturday evening.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer."

      "After a game in which Manchester United fans roundly booed a player they very recently considered one of their greatest hopes for the future, a number of them took a step towards ostracising a new great hope by abusing them on social media for their association with that most abominable defector.",
      "“Who’s that t*** from Argentina? Who’s that money-grabbing w**re” was the chant aimed at Alejandro Garnacho by the Red Devils faithful, all of whom will have no doubt sung ‘Viva Garnacho’ in earnest throughout a Manchester United career which, lest we forget, was cut short by Ruben Amorim, not Garnacho himself.",
      "Sure, Garnacho described the season as “sh*t” when asked for his assessment after being dropped for the Europa League final. But not one single United fan will have disagreed with that. And it was Amorim who told Garnacho in front of his teammates ahead of the final league game of the season that “you better pray you can find a new club to sign you”. He may well be a “money-grabbing w**re”, but he was given no option but to leave United.",
      "We understand some hostility on the basis of Garnacho wearing Marcus Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt, which was an absurdly childish means to wind up the club which was still paying his wages, but the decision had already been made by that point. He was never going to play for United again.",
      "Garnacho’s unforgivable crime was not being in the plans of a manager whose Old Trafford tenure is still widely deemed to be doomed despite the win over Chelsea, largely because of his failure to waver from a philosophy and formation unsuited to the vast majority of the players still in his squad, let alone those like Garnacho who have already escaped it.",
      "The 21-year-old was denied the opportunity to further rile with a goal and we suspect what would have been a badge-kissing celebration, but the Garnacho-obsessed United fans didn’t skip a post-match opportunity to make their confused feelings felt, when they piled on Amad Diallo for swapping shirts with the Argentinian.",
      "Amad was seen hugging Garnacho at full-time, like you or I might do when meeting a pal, before later posting a picture on Instagram of him and his former teammate smiling and posing with one another’s shirts, quite possibly under the instruction of Lead3rS, the agency which represents both of them.",
      "The more P.C. responses from United fans to the post, reported by The Sun, included ‘Amad is an idiot’, ‘Amad doing this sh*t after dropping a stinker’ and ‘can you read the room Amad?’ We don’t know how extensive and unpleasant the reaction was, though we can guess as the result was Amad deleting that post, all other Instagram posts and all but one on X.",
      "Our question to United fans is a simple one: Why do you care? The only effect of abusing Amad for being friends with Garnacho is to alienate another young player.",
      "It would have been unthinkable a year ago for Garnacho and fellow ‘untouchable’ Rasmus Hojlund to be playing elsewhere this season, while a third in Kobbie Mainoo looks for an exit. Amad was last season’s brightest spark, and is now being presented with reasons to think a future away from United is an attractive prospect by fans who can’t help but stick the boot in where it’s not needed.",
      "The switch from unadulterated love for Garnacho to pure hatred is weird enough, but for that remarkable feelings U-turn to extend to anyone who comes into contact with him is absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Enzo Maresca has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea without an attack through his substitutions in their defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer.",
      "A new report has revealed how Alejandro Garnacho and Ruben Amorim’s ‘relationship unravelled’, with an ‘intervention’ involving three Man Utd stars failing.",
      "Maresca dismissed suggestions he selected a weak Chelsea team with Bayern Munich in mind, while Garnacho is blamed for ‘falling asleep’.",
      "Chelsea needed a half-fit Cole Palmer to spark them into life at Brentford. But Alejandro Garnacho went to sleep on the Bees’ biggest weapon…",
      "It has been claimed that Chelsea could ‘almost immediately agree’ a mega-money transfer after signing Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United."

      "Manchester United’s victory over Chelsea on Saturday has relieved the mounting pressure on Ruben Amorim’s shoulders a touch, and he will no doubt take the win as a notch on his bedpost of obstinacy, but after Arne Slot turned a Liverpool star into one of the best, if not the best, in a previously alien position, Kobbie Mainoo must be wondering why a supposedly excellent coach can’t do the same for him.",
      "Mainoo was introduced in the 87th minute to see out United’s victory over Chelsea, and showed his worth to the team even in that short cameo, winning a corner in stoppage time to put the nail in the Blues’ coffin, having illustrated it far more evidently in the defeat to Manchester City as the Red Devils’ best player on the day after coming off the bench.",
      "The 20-year-old is yet to start a Premier League game this season, featuring for just 76 minutes in total, having been denied a loan exit at the end of the transfer window in search of more game time and amid rumours of January moves from various high-grade suitors.",
      "Amorim’s contention is that he can’t play Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in his double pivot. The United captain’s display against Chelsea served as a timely reminder as to why he remains so crucial to the Red Devils after an inauspicious start to the season.",
      "But Casemiro’s experience was no match for his stupidity and he is now suspended for their next game after his red card, and although Manuel Ugarte put in one of his better performances as his replacement in midfield at half-time, the Uruguayan’s very low bar suggests Amorim should at least be tempted to play Mainoo alongside his captain against Brentford next time out.",
      "Because while Amorim may currently feel as though he’s ill-suited to the role, and we don’t necessarily disagree, it is also possible for a coach to coach a footballer – particularly one so young and seemingly open to developing and adapting his game – into playing a new position.",
      "Just as Slot has done with Ryan Gravenberch, who was once again outstanding for Liverpool in their 2-1 win over Everton on Saturday, leading Michael Owen to question whether there is a better No.6 in the world right now.",
      "“He is seriously talented,” Owen said. “He can do anything. I love him in the sitting number six role. It just shows you can push him forward, and he can still have a big influence.",
      "“I look around the world at the moment at midfield players and I think, Who is better than him? Who is performing better than him? I don’t see many at all. I think, he is one of the finds of the last season or so.”",
      "He was heavily linked with the Liverpool exit in the summer of 2024, and if the Reds had landed Martin Zubimendi after having an offer accepted for the now Arsenal No.6, there’s a very good chance Gravenberch wouldn’t still be at the club.",
      "But in a situation very similar to the one being experienced by Amorim at United after they failed to sign Brighton’s Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfielder this summer, Slot was pushed into playing Gravenberch as a square peg in that round hole, and the Netherlands international is now perfectly spherical having adapted in stunning fashion.",
      "“Not just this season, he’s been playing like that from the moment last season started,” Virgil Van Dijk said after the win over Everton. “He’s unbelievable. He’s very important to the way we play.",
      "“You see the amount of times I try to look for him. It benefits him, me and the team. He’s in incredible shape. He’s in the form of his life. He has to keep going. He’s still young.",
      "“During his first season here he hardly played either. Listen, it’s a mix of everything: getting confidence, progressing and improving as a player, playing games at the highest level and knowing your role in the team.",
      "“I’m very pleased for him because he puts in a lot of hard work to do what he is doing.”",
      "We understand that a Mainoo-Fernandes partnership isn’t ideal, but nothing is at United right now, and if Slot can turn a negative into such a huge positive, why can’t Amorim?",
      "He’s concerned his players will lose respect for him if he wavers from his philosophy and formation, but surely the absolute opposite would be true if they witness him coaching one of the most talented footballers in the squad to operate in a role which – let’s face it – is hardly light and day to the one Mainoo thrived in for United and England last season.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",

      "“When I look at what he’s done today, I think Man Utd fans be a bit disappointed, maybe to not see Fernandes maybe unleashed on these number 10 roles, and Kobbie [Mainoo] in there, the back three. My biggest worry is lack of pace there.",

      "That pressure has now been transferred to Enzo Maresca, who’s been criticised for his reaction to Robert Sanchez’s early red card, which saw him take off Estevao for goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen and swap out Pedro Neto for Tosin Adarabioyo, before Cole Palmer’s niggle forced him off for Andrey Santos.",
      "Explaining his decisions, Maresca said: “The reason why we changed Pedro and Estevao was because they attack with the five players always.",
      "“And we defend with the four, and we can defend with the four when we are 11 vs 11, but 11 against 10, I think we need to defend with the width, so we decided to go with the back-five, this is the reason why.",
      "“And then the other one, Garna, he was ready to go on, but then Wes[ley Fofana] asked for the change, because he was tired after a long time, so we changed and we decided to go for Tyrique [George], and the idea was to give Garnacho minutes.”",
      "Asked if the crowd’s negative reaction to Garnacho warming up had any impact, Maresca insisted: “No, no, no. He was ready, I sent him for the warm up and he was ready but then Wes asked for the change so we decided to go with Malo.”",
      "Danny Murphy told BBC’s Match of the Day that he thought Maresca’s substitutions were “really negative”.",
      "“I think bringing an extra defending on is understandable and taking off an attacker, but a few minutes later Palmer is off after they’re 1-0 down,” he said.",

      "1) From openly defying hypothetical papal tactical demands one day to actively personifying the ‘call an ambulance…but not for me’ meme the next, it feels like whatever ultimately comes of this absurd reign of Ruben Amorim he has at least embraced the innate box-officeness of a Portuguese Manchester United manager.",
      "These are still foundations built out of water on a bouncy castle made from quicksand while wearing a blindfold and boxing gloves, but that Manchester United supporter is as close as he has ever been to getting a haircut and Amorim is delivering with interest on the promise he made upon his appointment.",
      "",
      "2) It should have been considerably easier. As the first half reached a crescendo of ludicrousness it became a case study in the importance of confidence in elite sport.",
      "These are ultra athletes who have every microscopic detail of the game fine-tuned by the finest minds around. But while Manchester United had the advantage in terms of numbers it was little more than 11 players with a collective belief surging through them against ten disjointed, shell-shocked individuals trying to survive.",
      "That sort of momentum never carries through over 90 minutes and it is crucial to adjust to those shifts in energy. It would have done Manchester United the world of good to win by three or four goals but the fortitude they displayed to hold on might actually be more beneficial in the long run.",
      "",
      "3) Even for Amorim personally it was far better game management than usual.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was unfortunate to be sacrificed at half-time but Manuel Ugarte helped ensure the midfield battle remained even on one of his better performances. Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Leny Yoro were more like-for-like replacements which introduced fresh legs. And Bruno Fernandes coming off was surprising, even before taking into account who was replacing him.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is still having his minutes bizarrely rationed but a cameo in which he won a free-kick and a corner while running down the clock was encouraging. He brought belated control to a game defined by chaos.",
      "",
      "4) Enzo Maresca, as the scriptures dictate, must adopt the crisis baton. And good lord was this a full-blown mid-life crisis.",
      "Robert Sanchez being sent off in the fifth minute was not ideal. Being critical, Robert Sanchez playing at all for a player trading entity which has spent £427billion on signings in the last three years is sub-optimal.",
      "But we’re splitting hairs and never has a single human been more bald than when Maresca responded by removing two of his forwards to chuck on a keeper and another centre-half, thus shedding more than a quarter of his starting XI within seven minutes of kick off.",
      "It does appear that an injury had befallen Cole Palmer, who himself was removed in the 21st. Yet Maresca himself said after the game that the England international had undergone fitness tests in the morning and “was not 100%”, so quite why Estevao Willian, Pedro Neto and any semblance of Chelsea’s pace and width had to also be abandoned is a mystery.",
      "Becoming the first manager in Premier League history to make as many as three substitutions in the opening 21 minutes of a game almost entirely because of a single mismanaged red card is hilariously damning.",
      "",
      "5) Maresca even openly and apparently without a modicum of professional shame admitted after the game that “all the plan went in the bin after the red card”, as if that isn’t a massively embarrassing indictment on him as the coach.",
      "It is honestly difficult to recall a worse example of management in an entire half of Premier League football.",
      "",
      "6) It transmitted a message of panic to the players, a collective headloss from which they could not fully recover.",
      "In the 13 minutes between the first two substitutes coming on and Palmer going off, Chelsea’s combined pass success rate was 53%. Every defender and keeper Filip Jorgensen was guilty of ceding possession in dangerous areas under pressure from an invigorated Manchester United as such a wholesale change of shape and personnel evoked a sense of hysteria and doubt.",
      "At one point in the first half a remarkably Italian voice could be heard screaming “eh, eh, eh, Reece take the throw-in” when Wesley Fofana had the ball in his hands on the halfway line. It epitomised a side being micro-managed into oblivion.",
      "The red card created the sort of problem coaches tend to try and alleviate. Maresca exacerbated it.",
      "",
      "7) It was a lightning quick Manchester United start. In the opening couple of minutes a cross barely evaded Sesko in the area, skidding across the turf and onto the head of Bryan Mbeumo to force a save from Sanchez.",
      "Soon after, a long Altay Bayindir kick was flicked on by Sesko for Mbeumo to chase, round Sanchez and elicit the red card.",
      "There was a sense at that point that Manchester United had to capitalise on their ascendancy. A desperation, even, summed up by Matthijs de Ligt shooting from range in the 11th minute as if trying desperately to break a low block in second half stoppage time.",
      "But then a fine move culminated in Noussair Mazraoui crossing for Patrick Dorgu’s clever head back into the centre as Bruno Fernandes timed his run impeccably to convert.",
      "Dorgu is bafflingly important in terms of the attacking structures of a club which spent £200m on new forwards this summer, but early on he was excellent and there is hope that, at 20, those fundamentals can eventually be polished and harnessed.",
      "",
      "8) Casemiro going through the back of Enzo Fernandez near the halfway line as both the Argentinean and Chelsea as an entity posed precisely zero threat had an immediate air of the foreboding seemingly random brief highlight on Match of the Day.",
      "The second yellow about half an hour later for an arguably soft but ultimately completely avoidable and entirely stupid foul on Andrey Santos confirmed it.",
      "If a 33-year-old 78-cap Brazil international five-time European champion doesn’t realise he can’t slide tackle from behind or grab people and fall over then he probably can’t be relied upon consistently in a competent midfield, never mind this Manchester United one.",
      "",
      "9) There was at least a parting gift as Casemiro headed Manchester United into a two-goal lead shortly before indulging in the sort of foolishness which really ought to be beyond his years.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is presumably still watching and waiting for that ball to come down into the gaggle of players while forgetting he has the slight in-built advantage over them in being able to use his hands.",
      "It was atrocious goalkeeping and Chelsea will remain completely unserious while they steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that having a good, even just reliable presence between the posts is quite important.",
      "",
      "10) A couple of minutes after that goal, Manchester United should have had another. Amad won the ball from Fofana in Chelsea’s defensive third and raced towards goal with Jorgensen venturing comedically and pointedly far off his line to close the angle.",
      "Sesko was waiting unmarked in the middle but the ball never came, with Casemiro’s red ultimately falling on the Slovenian’s head.",
      "Another goalless game will delight the growing critics but his flick-on for the Sanchez red proved decisive and there were some bright moments of link-up play from a striker whose development cannot have been aided by these stop-start beginnings.",
      "",
      "11) It did seem at one point as though Chelsea’s best hope would be for the game to be abandoned due to a waterlogged pitch.",
      "Or beyond that, maybe for them to have a semblance of an attacking idea beyond just giving the ball to Joao Pedro and expecting him to dribble past five or six players before scoring.",
      "Even when Casemiro was sent off and parity in terms of numbers was restored, Chelsea were in no position to capitalise after those perplexing early changes. It’s almost like giving up all hope on a game after five minutes because of one setback is unnecessary.",
      "",
      "12) Maresca did still have two substitutions left, so obviously brought on Tyrique George and Malo Gusto – a forward they tried to sell this summer and a full-back when theoretically chasing a result.",
      "It meant £48.5m Jamie Gittens, £40m and incredibly motivated Alejandro Garnacho and Marc Guiu, who has not played since being recalled from his loan at Sunderland almost three weeks ago, remained on the bench.",
      "The game management was poor but that man management is diabolical.",
      "",
      "13) The one positive to come out of this game for Chelsea was the performance of Reece James at right-back. A few of his deliveries were exceptional, including the cross Trevoh Chalobah converted late on.",
      "It doesn’t feel like that will be enough to convince Maresca it might be worth deploying the very good right-back at right-back more often but still.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United were excellent defensively, with De Ligt continuing to grow into his leadership role. The hosts wouldn’t have held out without him. He’d have even given Gabby Agbonlahor and Gary Taylor-Fletcher a challenge in this mood.",
      "",
      "15) That is a bruising week for Chelsea, their first run of three winless games since February.",
      "Maresca does have credit in the bank through Champions League qualification and some lesser trophies but it has been an underwhelming start to the season with an even shorter title challenge than the one the Italian spent most of last season writing off anyway.",
      "He was right when he said these players were “not ready” to compete for that level of silverware; there needs to be a degree of introspection in accepting that the same should be said of him too.",
      "",
      "16) This was the first Premier League game Manchester United have won without scoring in the second half since March 2024. It inherently feels more sustainable than relying on stoppage-time penalties and late individual heroics to get through.",
      "For a team and a coach basically learning how to win together it was potentially transformative how they did it. They could also entirely feasibly follow this up with defeats to Brentford and Sunderland before the international break, because ultimately inferring anything about this club based on a single result or performance is really stupid and only the sort of thing their billionaire owners should indulge in.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Pep Guardiola resorted to parking the bus at the Emirates and it still wasn’t enough on a day where Liverpool feel like the only winners.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is a sackable offence for all but actual Manchester United managers. Enzo Maresca could be in real trouble now.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca criticised one of his Chelsea players who ‘made a right hash of it’ in defeat to Man Utd on Saturday, explaining what he would have ‘preferred’."

      "Facing a Chelsea side doing everything in their power to keep Ruben Amorim in a job, even Manchester United couldn’t mess that one up, despite Casemiro’s best attempts.",
      "First things first, that was an astonishing game of football. The first half between Manchester United and Chelsea was one of the most manic, ridiculous halves of football you will see all season. The second 45 didn’t have quite as much drama, but it still delivered some ridiculous Barclays.",
      "Robert Sanchez was sent off for taking out Bryan Mbeumo on the edge of the box with only five minutes on the clock, prompting Enzo Maresca to make an early double change, hooking Estevao and Pedro Neto for Tosin Adarabioyo and goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen in a bizarre ploy that removed all of the pace from his attack and the majority of their threat on the break.",
      "Nine minutes after Sanchez’s red, United took the lead through Bruno Fernandes. VAR then threatened to disallow it for offside. Chelsea continued to be absolutely shambolic thanks to some terrible in-game management from Maresca, while Cole Palmer was brought off with what was hopefully an injury. With 70 minutes remaining, Amorim’s men were up against 10 men, all over the place, without their best player and without the ability to counter-attack effectively. Even they couldn’t f**k this, right?",
      "Well, it got better when Casemiro scored in the 37th minute, until he went from unlikely hero to likely villain. With both teams down to 10 and Alejandro Garnacho on the bench, there was the potential for the most hilarious outcome ever.",
      "In the torrential rain that the Old Trafford roof definitely couldn’t handle, there were fouls left, right and centre and the ball was slowing down in puddles while Amorim wished he had his wellies for the paddling pool in his technical area.",
      "As we say, it was a mad one.",
      "Tactics were thrown out of the window with both teams — especially Chelsea — incredibly open, as Maresca continued to make things up as he went along. In a game Amorim desperately needed to win with United 17th in the Premier League at kick-off, he managed it much better than the Blues boss and has bought himself some time with a crucial win against a team doing their best United-under-Amorim impression.",
      "From the three early changes made by Maresca, it was surprising that Wesley Fofana was not one of the players he hooked, even with a natural defender in Tosin replacing a winger. But there was always a chance that United would go full United and throw away the most glorious opportunity to beat a ‘Big Six’ rival. At least they ended up not having to worry about Garnacho influencing a comeback after Maresca used his last substitution with 26 minutes left. His brother’s Instagram story will be interesting.",
      "One of those to come on was Tyrique George, who finally provided some pace out wide for the visitors. We’re very surprised it wasn’t Garnacho. And Fofana was eventually brought off as well. Were they the worst five substitutions made by a manager in a single Premier League game?",
      "Despite some questionable management, Chelsea were able to grow into the game by knocking it around, but their ability to unlock the United defence was restricted as Palmer watched from the bench. One moment of quality set up a big last 10 when Reece James’ pinpoint cross was met by Trevoh Chalobah’s forehead for Chelsea’s first effort on target — and a goal that Altay Bayindir could do nothing to stop.",
      "Chelsea pushed for an equaliser that they didn’t deserve and which would have made Casemiro public enemy number one in Manchester, having thrown away United’s control with a stupid second yellow card, but United held on and successfully navigated the closing minutes.",
      "Thankfully for Amorim, his players held on for a first home win against a ‘Big Six’ rival under his watch. Chelsea, on the other hand, end an abysmal week with one of their most dysfunctional and calamitous performances under Maresca. They threw it away at Brentford last weekend, were thumped by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and now they’ve lost to the most beatable United team since, well, last season, giving them little choice but to take advantage and earn a fat, juicy win.",
      "United will take what they’re given and try to beat what’s in front of them. This victory gives Amorim more time to get his players used to a formation that hasn’t been working and shows he can beat teams deemed direct rivals, even if 11 places separated them last season.",
      "He’s clearly still working things out, continuing his 100% record of changing his back three every single game this season as Matthijs de Ligt was again the only centre-back to start and finish a Premier League match.",
      "With United 2-0 up and looking for more, one thing Amorim probably felt he’d worked out was his best central-midfield pairing, with Fernandes and Casemiro on the scoresheet. But the latter did his best to make an already breathtaking game even more dramatic. We thank him, but Amorim definitely will not.",
      "At the end of the day, it’s three points for Amorim and Manchester United. Three fat, succulent points they desperately needed. A turning point? Nah, they’ve run out of turning points. But there’s hope. And that’s all you can ask for.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is a sackable offence for all but actual Manchester United managers. Enzo Maresca could be in real trouble now.",
      "Enzo Maresca criticised one of his Chelsea players who ‘made a right hash of it’ in defeat to Man Utd on Saturday, explaining what he would have ‘preferred’.",
      "Enzo Maresca has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea without an attack through his substitutions in their defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "Ruben Amorim may be ‘gaslighting’ the Man Utd fans but he ‘exposed the fraud’ Enzo Maresca on Saturday, whose sacking should be one of two Chelsea priorities.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Enzo Maresca has defended Chelsea’s treatment of ostracised duo Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, saying his father’s life as a fisherman is more difficult."

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited the training ground to meet with Ruben Amorim this week following their poor start to the season; Amorim: \"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win\"",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 14:16, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has played down the significance of a meeting with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe at the club's training ground this week, insisting their talks were \"normal\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract,\" Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe's visit.",
      "\"No, it's normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it's a long project. He said many times, 'This is my third season.' For me, it's not. But normal things.",
      "\"I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.",
      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",
      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",
