      "Antonio Conte has revealed he was surprised Napoli were able to sign Scott McTominay from Manchester United last summer. The Scotland international helped inspire a Serie A title win in his first season at the club as he played a pivotal role in the success.",
      "United accepted a £25.4million bid for McTominay as they parted ways with the academy product in August 2024, much to ex-Chelsea boss Conte's delight. Then Red Devils head coach Erik ten Hag blamed profit and sustainability rules for the sale of the midfielder, admitting he had mixed feelings about the deal.",
      "But while McTominay had struggled to secure a position in the Dutchman's starting XI consistently, he quickly proved his worth to Conte. The 27-year-old deliverd 12 goals and six assists in 34 appearances during his debut season in Italy, including six goals in the final seven matches as Napoli earned the title over Inter Milan on the final day of the season.",
      "And Conte was surprised to have McTominay at his disposal at all. Despite being told by club chiefs that his signature could be secured, the Italian thought Napoli's lack of European football could be problematic.",
      "But the 55-year-old knew the player was underutilised at Old Trafford. Conte was more than happy to take advantage of the opportunity.",
      "\"Scott is a player whom I knew really well. He was born and raised at Manchester United,\" Conte told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"I could see that he always made an impact when he played, but at the same time, I noticed he wasn't used as a key player at Manchester United.",
      "\"He was hardly a starter. Honestly, we had talked about it with [Napoli director] Giovanni Manna. He told me it was a possible solution.",
      "\"Sometimes, directors make up stories also to keep you calm. If you ask me: 'Have you ever thought McTominay would surely arrive?' I'd say no.",
      "\"Don't forget we were heading into a season without European trophies to play for, so he had to leave Manchester United to start over with us.\"",
      "Conte was left with a single frustration, McTominay's signing happened too close to the end of the window.",
      "“A bit late, but he arrived and I was very happy because Manna was good at signing him,” Conte said. “We had discussed McTominay, but I didn’t think he would really join us.”",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been warned he could soon be under pressure at Old Trafford if he does not start next season well. The Portuguese head coach saw the Red Devils finish 15th last season following his first months in charge.",
      "Amorim arrived in November to replace Erik ten Hag, just months after the Dutch coach signed a new deal with the club. And while under contract until 2027, the former Sporting boss will find plenty of scrutiny have failed to improve United's form during his time at the club so far.",
      "The 40-year-old guided United to the final of the Europa League but could not prevent them missing out on European qualification as his team struggled to put a run of wins together. But this summer will provide the first opporunity for Amorim to spend pre-season with his squad to implement his methods.",
      "United's spending has already proven significant with the addition of Matheus Cunha from Wolves. The club could yet land Bryan Mbeumo and another striker in the transfer market too.",
      "And former United coach Rene Meulensteen reckons Amorim will need to hit the ground running in 2024/25. If not, the Dutch coach believes that his position may be in jeopardy before the end of the year.",
      "\"If things carry on into next season and getting towards Christmas, Ruben Amorim’s job will be on the line,\" Meulensteen told InstantWithdrawalBettingSites. \"The club hierarchy will have no choice but to discuss if he is the right man going forward after how badly last season went – that’s why a good start to the season is a must.\"",
      "Meulensteen suggests that Amorim's rigid style could yet hold the team back, even with the club's activity in the transfer market. The current players linked do not fix all of United's issues in the mind of Alex Ferguson's former assistant.",
      "\"When you're managing Manchester United the target should always be to win the title, but if Ruben Amorim said that now then people would think he is mad,\" he added.",
      "\"If United somehow get to Christmas with only one or two draws and defeats then people might think the club are back, but I can’t see it happening because Amorim is stuck in his system and they are massively vulnerable.",
      "\"I think if United start the season with Andre Onana and Harry Maguire in defence then there will still be a lot of question marks in the unit and other teams will take advantage of that.",
      "\"You can strengthen with Viktor Gyokeres, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo alongside Bruno Fernandes but the midfield and the defence will still be overrun.",
      "\"The minimum has to be to get back into the Champions League, but Amorim has to be careful because not having an adaptable system is not a clever thing to do. You have to be flexible and be able to adapt when needed.\"",

      "While fans are eager to know if the pair are pals, the Argentinian World Cup winner has now opened up on where he stands with his Portuguese rival. Messi, 37, is still causing waves on the world's stage for Inter Miami, while Ronaldo, 40, now plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Messi gave a timely reminder of his genius on Thursday, giving Miami their first win the Club World Cup with a breathtaking free-kick against FC Porto.",
      "Afterwards, he discussed his long-term adversary Ronaldo, claiming that they are not actually friends. However, he explained that's only the case as the pair barely get a chance to cross paths.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and for the career he's had and continues to have, because he's still competing at the highest level,\" Messi told DSports.",
      "\"The competition with him was on the pitch. Each of us wanted to do the best for our team. Obviously, as always, everything stayed on the field. Off the pitch, we are two normal people. We're not friends obviously because we don't spend time together, but we've always treated each other with a lot of respect.\"",
      "His comments echo his take on the relationship that he made eight years ago. Messi told Spanish outlet Marca in 2017: \"I don't know if we will be [friends]. Friendship is built through spending time together and getting to know each other.",
      "\"We have no relationship, mainly because we only see each other at awards ceremonies and that's the only time we speak. Everything is fine, but our lives don't cross over very often.\"",
      "Does Ronaldo feel the same way? In an interview with Spanish outlet El Chiringuito earlier this year, the ex-Manchester United star claimed he is on good terms with the Miami star due their 'healthy' rivalry – although he has distanced himself from having a friendship with Messi in the recent past.",
      "\"I have a good relationship with Leo Messi,\" said Ronaldo this year. \"I was translating him in English at an award ceremony too! It was funny. It was a healthy rivalry, we got along.\"",
      "However, speaking in 2023, Ronaldo explained: \"I don't see things like that [as a rivalry], the rivalry is gone. It was good, spectators liked it.",
      "\"Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don't have to hate Messi and vice versa. He's followed his path, and I have followed mine, regardless of playing outside of Europe.",
      "\"The legacy lives on, but I don't see the rivalry like that. We shared the stage many times, it was 15 years. I'm not saying we're friends, I've never had dinner with him, but we're professional colleagues and we respect each other.\"",
      "While the constant debate of just who is the better player, as well as their La Liga battles, have spurred on the question of whether the two are friends - there is another point of contention between the pair: the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Messi has been crowned the winner of the prestigious award eight times, while Ronaldo is his closest challenger on five, which has caused some friction. Yet it seems the iconic duo, while not likely to be spotted dining together any time soon, have put their famous rivalry to one side, for now."

And since then, there has practically been silence from North London, with Arsenal’s pursuit being put on ice amid interest in alternative forward Benjamin Sesko.",

Sporting president Federico Varandas has already given his take on the talks between Viana, Gyokeres and Cetinkaya.",

That Sporting would not demand a release clause now. For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100 or 90 million euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40, 60 or 80. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million euros. From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures or values.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has been told it is a no-brainer choosing a move to Manchester United over Tottenham.",
      "United have already failed with a £55million bid for Mbeumo, with Spurs hopeful the appointment of Thomas Frank as boss can help convince the striker to make the same switch from Brentford.",
      "The two Premier League clubs are fighting it out for Mbeumo, but former United winger Lee Sharpe said he must choose the Red Devils over Spurs – despite the lack of European football.",
      "United lost the Europa League final 1-0 to Spurs last month, meaning Old Trafford will not play host to European football for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "Despite that, Sharpe has told 26-year-old Mbeumo he must choose United, despite the fact he will be turning his back on the Champions League and the chance to link up with his former boss.",
      "“It will be a really tough decision for Mbeumo,” Sharpe told Aceodds.com. “To go to Tottenham, playing in the Champions League with the manager you have been playing under and trusts you, knows your game and personality which makes the transition a lot easier.",
      "“But there's only one Manchester United and the opportunity to play for United doesn’t come along many times in your career - maybe even not at all.",
      "“I understand that Tottenham are playing in Europe, and might seem like a better option to him, with a manager he knows. But I think that if he can be a part of this rebuild and do well, he will never look back.”",
      "Sharpe, who spent eight years at United, making 263 appearances and scoring 36 goals, also questioned whether Jadon Sancho is good enough to play in the Premier League.",
      "United winger Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and is facing an uncertain future, with the London club having paid the Red Devils a £5m fee not to make the move permanent.",
      "Against that backdrop, Sharpe questioned whether Sancho is cut out for the Premier League and suggested a move back to Germany – where he played for Borussia Dortmund – may better suit him.",
      "“It’s been a shame with Sancho, because he’s one of the players I would pay an entrance fee to go and watch,” said Sharpe. “His footwork and ability to take people on is great.",
      "“As a kid, I would have wanted his name in the back of my shirt. I want to watch him dribble and beat players. On his day he’s awesome.",
      "“He just doesn't seem to be able to do in the Premier League and the pace the league is at. I think he's quick enough, but I don’t know if likes dealing with the physicality. He can go past people like they're not even there and at times he just seems to take the easy option and pass it square.",
      "“With his ability, he should be taking players on at every opportunity and I don’t think he does it enough. He’s unbelievably talented but doesn’t do it enough. Maybe Germany suits him more, where teams don’t sit in as much and he has more time and space to beat players.”",
      "Lee Sharpe was speaking to Aceodds. The full interview can be found here Aceodds.com",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "They will take on Premier League rivals West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton as part of that tour. But Ruben Amorim is set to take a brutal approach to his squad with many stars expected to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "According to The Sun, four out-of-favour stars are set to be left behind at Carrington for the tour should they fail to seal moves away from United before then. That includes academy graduate Rashford after Aston Villa turned down the chance to sign him permanently following his loan spell.",

      "Napoli have since emerged for his services but are struggling to afford his wages as it stands. Alejandro Garnacho also faces little prospect of a future at United - the Argentine having also been linked with Napoli.",
      "The final player that Amorim wants to leave behind is Antony. The Brazilian winger has struggled since his big-money move from Ajax and while he impressed with Real Betis last term, the Spanish side are yet to make a renewed move.",
      "Explaining Amorim’s hardline stance, a source quoted by The Sun said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas. He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "While Amorim is set to axe a few faces from his squad for United’s pre-season commitments, there could also be a few new additions to the squad. Matheus Cunha is due to join up with the Red Devils following his £62.5m move from Wolves.",
      "He could yet be joined by Bryan Mbeumo, who remains at the heart of a tug of war between United and Tottenham. As it stands, he favours a move to Old Trafford but United chiefs are yet to agree terms with the Bees over the Cameroon forward.",

      "They shared a two-minute long video on Twitter on Thursday afternoon showing every Premier League goal that Mbeumo had scored last season. Of course, the 26-year-old enjoyed a stunning campaign as he plundered 20 goals for the Bees - something that has likely triggered interest in his services.",
      "Some Red Devils fans even suggested that a transfer could be imminent after watching the video. One fan said: “Farewell comp?” While another added: “Time to let him go, gents.” A final fan replied: \"We will love to see this at Old Trafford.\"",
      "Mbeumo has already broken his silence on his future having admitted he was slightly unprepared for the furore around a transfer, albeit was taking it in his stride. He said: \"It (transfer speculation) is a bit new for me I would say! I think it can be the life of a footballer, and you need to accept it.",

      "The 27-year-old scored 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal. Arsenal, Manchester United and Juventus have all been heavily linked with Gyokeres, but it appears the player has his heart set on a move to the Emirates.",
      "It emerged earlier this month that Juventus were ready to offer Gyokeres a stunning £11m-per-year deal to try and persuade him to snub a Premier League move in favour of a switch to Serie A.",
      "However, Corriere dello Sport are now reporting that Juventus have been informed that Gyokeres only wants to join Arsenal this summer. The news comes amid a public spat between Gyokeres' agent and Sporting over a supposed 'gentleman's agreement'.",
      "Gyokeres has an £85million release clause, but his agent has claimed he reached an agreement with the club last season that they would accept bids in the region of £60m. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has insisted that is not the case.",
      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me. I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",

      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",

      "Sporting CP striker Conrad Harder has offered his thoughts on fellow frontman Viktor Gyokeres’ ongoing transfer saga. Gyokeres, 27, has attracted plenty of attention following his prolific two-year spell in Portugal.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are each interested in the ex-Coventry City star, who has scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting. And Gyokeres’ future has taken another recent twist after he reportedly rejected the chance to have clear-the-air talks with Sporting. It is claimed that the tension initially stemmed from the club demanding a higher fee than expected after promising to sell him this summer.",
      "It remains to be seen where Gyokeres will be playing his football next season, as Arsenal have also had their attention on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while United is not seen to be the preferred option for Gyokeres, despite Old Trafford being where his former manager at Sporting, Ruben Amorim, now resides.",
      "However, despite the transfer drama surrounding Gyokeres, it clearly does not concern his Sporting team-mate Harder, who is in fact relishing the chance to take his place next term.",
      "\"Gyokeres? I'm not interested in any news,” Harder told Sport TV, as per Portuguese outlet A Bola. “I am focusing on myself. I want to play. We'll see what happens.",
      "“It's important for me to have minutes now. I was on the bench for a year, and I need to play. I think I'm ready, and we'll see. It will be good to have minutes.",
      "“We will never forget what Viktor did at Sporting. Never! But I hope that the team and I can live up to the challenge. I'll do my best. I think I'm ready.",
      "“I'm not ready to be the new Viktor; he's 27 years old, I'm 20... But I'm prepared to do what I'm best at. And we'll see what I can bring to the team. I want to stay at Sporting.”",
      "Harder spoke after scoring a brace for Denmark in their draw with Finland at the Under-21 Euros on Wednesday. The young forward will hope to keep his place for Denmark’s quarter-final clash with France as he also seeks to prove he can fill the potential void left by Gyokeres at Sporting.",
      "\"I can use this tournament to gain some form. I haven't played that much in the last four or five months, so having game minutes is incredible,” Harder explained. “I think I've already proven to many people that I'm ready to play, but I want to prove a little more that I'm ready to play.”",
      "Harder was forced to be back-up to Gyokeres after arriving from Nordsjaelland last summer, but he made the most of his limited time on the pitch. He ended the season with 13 goals and 10 assists in all competitions, despite only making 21 starts, as Sporting won the Primeira Liga and Taca de Portugal.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres, who is currently on holiday in Saint Tropez, recently dismissed the noise around his future. Posting on his Instagram story, the striker wrote: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has spoken openly about Gyokeres’ situation. Varandas defended the club’s position and explained that Sporting are yet to receive an offer for their talisman.",
      "“One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me,” Varandas said, as per Portuguese outlet Record. \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "“This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season. During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him.",
      "\"When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.\"",

Gyokeres’ sensational form over the past two seasons has seen Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United both heavily linked with the Swede this summer.",
      "And it has emerged that Gyokeres prefers a move to north London under Mikel Arteta over being reunited with his former boss, Ruben Amorim, at Old Trafford.",
      "But it appears his dream move to Arsenal has hit a stumbling block due to the fee demanded by the Portuguese champions being too high. Reports had stated that the 27-year-old striker would be allowed to leave Sporting for a fee below his £84m release clause.",
      "His agent, Hassan Cetinkaya, claimed he reached a gentleman’s agreement with the club last summer which meant they would accept any offer in the region of £60m (€70m consisting of €60m plus €10m in bonuses), even saying that he had a signed letter to prove it.",
      "However, Sporting’s club president Frederico Varandas has accused Gyokeres' team of trying to 'blackmail' the Portuguese giants into allowing their talisman to leave. The club are therefore holding out for a significantly higher fee which has stalled his potential exit.",
      "And on Wednesday, during a conversation between Luís Aguilar, Marco Caneira and Pedro Henriques on the Jogo Aberto podcast, it was claimed that there was indeed no written document signed by Sporting bosses that obliges the club to accept a lower offer.",
      "Former Sporting defender Caneira said: “Sporting are calm, the agent’s main problem is the contract he has with the player, which is coming to an end.”",
      "Co-host and former Benfica star Henriques added: “Gyokeres’ agent’s strategy only creates chaos and discomfort.”",
      "Meanwhile, Portuguese publication A Bola reports that Cetinkaya’s bold claim actually refers to a clause that allows him to receive 10% of any external offer over £51.3m (€60m), which Sporting rejects.",
      "It also states that the clause isn’t in letter form but in the contract the Sweden international signed in the summer of 2023, following his move from Coventry City.",
      "If that clause is triggered, Sporting will then demand the full £84m release clause in order to let him go – something that is unlikely to sit well with the forward.",
      "Gyokeres has reportedly already threatened to go on strike after vowing to 'speak at the right time.'",
      "According to A Bola, he is 'very upset' with Sporting's current stance and has made his feelings clear to the club's hierarchy.",
      "Arsenal have not put all their eggs in one basket, as a result of the issues surrounding Gyokeres' exit from Sporting. Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig is also being hunted, and the Gunners are looking to see which deal will offer the best value for money.",
      "United, meanwhile, have so far struggled to follow up their signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, as Tottenham's interest in Bryan Mbuemo has seen that move stall.",

      "Manchester United have announced academy director Nick Cox is leaving the club to join Everton as their new technical director.",
      "Cox is leaving Old Trafford after nine years worth of service, during which time he oversaw the rise and development of countless youngsters, including Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "He joined United in 2016 and then stepped up to lead their academy three years later. Everton headhunted Cox as part of their restructuring under the Friedkin Group, who completed their takeover of the club last December.",
      "Angus Kinnear, formerly of Leeds United, was appointed the Toffees' new chief executive last month. Cox is one of four key appointments Everton have made, highlighting the scale of their off-field restructure.",
      "On his departure, Cox said: \"Youth development is an important part of the lifeblood of this club, having the responsibility of supporting this generation of young people and staff to ensure that the system continues to thrive has been an immense privilege.",
      "\"Working alongside some of the most talented and dedicated youth developers in the world has been a huge honour. There are countless individuals behind the scenes who play a vital role in supporting our young players to maximise their potential.",
      "\"I will be forever grateful for their support and know they will ensure that the academy continues to go from strength to strength as the club enters an exciting new era.\"",
      "United have confirmed Cox will remain at Old Trafford 'for the coming months' to oversee a smooth transition. He is very well respected in M16 and will leave the academy in excellent shape.",
      "On Cox's departure, United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, said: \"Nick has made a huge contribution to Manchester United over the past nine years.",
      "\"I was already well aware of his qualities before I arrived at the club and have really enjoyed working together.",
      "\"Identifying and developing the best youth talent remains one of this club's top priorities and we are grateful for the work Nick has done to provide such a strong foundation for us to continue to build on.\""

      "Manchester United will be hoping that everything goes to plan during the summer transfer window this year.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be preparing for his first full season as United's head coach and seek major improvement on the 15th place finish in the Premier League from last term. The transfer market gives United the opportunity to strengthen their squad and have already made one new signing.",
      "Matheus Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford after United agreed to pay the £62.5million release clause in the Brazilian's contract at Molineux.",

      "Manchester United have been advised that acquiring Emiliano Martinez could spark a series of new signings.",
      "The Argentine goalkeeper is anticipated to depart Aston Villa this summer, having seemingly bid an emotional farewell to supporters after the club's final home match of the season.

      "Considering United finished the 2023/24 Premier League season with a negative goal difference, they should have prioritised more attacking additions. They were made to pay for their approach in 2024/25, of course, finishing with a negative goal difference of -10.",
      "In a bid to correct their attacking woes, though, United have already swooped for Matheus Cunha from Wolves and are still looking to get a deal in place for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They got 35 Premier League goals between them last term.",

      "\"I'm confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we've gone into,\" Omar Berrada said in a recent interview about Manchester United's transfer business.",
      "Going into the final stretch of June and into July, United have already done that. Matheus Cunha, an attacking playmaker who scored 15 Premier League goals last term, has already signed after the club triggered his £62.5million release clause at Wolves.",
      "Work to add Bryan Mbeumo to Ruben Amorim's attack has been in progress for two weeks now. Despite Tottenham's suggested plan to hijack the move and reunite the forward, who scores five more goals than Cunha, with Thomas Frank, it's understood that the 25-year-old wants to join United.",
      "After Mbeumo, a striker will be prioritised followed by the potential of a new goalkeeper and defender. Victor Osimhen, Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres are all on their radar but the fees being touted make it hard to imagine a deal being sealed any time soon.",
      "However, the window is open for over two more months and United aren't going to act restlessly just to get players through the door. \"We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" Berrada told The Athletic recently.",
      "\"Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.”",
      "The Premier League's Profit & Sustainability rules (PSR) are also set to force United to work smartly. It's been widely reported that United need to sell players to raise funds this summer and yet, that hasn't happened yet.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been linked with moves to Italy, Spain and Premier League rivals while Antony's short-term stint at Real Betis has left the Los Verdiblancos contemplating every available route to sign him permanently.",
      "The situation that has gathered some pace in recent days is Jadon Sancho's. After Chelsea paid £5m to cancel their obligation to sign the forward for £25m, Sancho's future beyond this summer is unclear.",
      "Italian journalist Marco Giordano has reported that Juventus have made an official bid worth €25million (£21.3m) for Sancho, who is yet to be convinced of a move to Turn. That figure falls slightly below United's asking price but as it is transfer season, there could be a workaround.",
      "United need a striker and the prospect of paying £60m+ for Gyokeres or Osimhen or Ekitike seems as far-fetched as United competing for the Premier League title this season. Cheaper alternatives continued to be linked and one name which constantly finds itself in the rumour mill is Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "After turning down Arsenal to join Juve, Vlahovic has found himself tipped to move to the Premier League. The Serbia international has scored 56 goals for the Old Lady but Randal Kolo Muani's permanent switch from Paris Saint-Germain this summer means he isn't guaranteed minutes under Igor Tudor.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus' general director Damien Comolli flew out to the United States to look at solving Vlahovic's situation. With 12 months left on his contract, it's claimed that Juventus have proposed a new deal, one that is of no interest to the striker.",
      "It's said that Vlahovic currently earns £10.2m per year, which sits just under £200,000-per-week, but the Serie A's side's new offer will see him earn closer to £147,000-per-week. The probability of Vlahovic moving on from Turn is greater than ever and it's understood that Juventus value him at just €30m (£25.6m).",
      "Selling Sancho to Juventus for close to £25m and signing a striker with a decent track record in front of goal for the same price would be a smart move. Something United have lacked in the past is acute deals and this would be a masterstroke from Jason Wilcox."

      "Eric Cantona and Daniel James have nothing in common other than playing for the Uniteds of Leeds and Manchester. The second thing they could share is applause at Old Trafford as a Leeds player.",
      "James had a respectable two years at United, who banked a rare profit with his £25million sale to Leeds in 2021. He is yet to play for his parent club at Old Trafford. When he emerged for Fulham against United in 2022, the rendition of 'We all hate Leeds scum' was not particularly caustic.",
      "Some United fans put their hands together for Cantona on his maiden appearance in M16 in September 1992. In the white of Leeds, Cantona attempted an overhead kick from the edge of the area at the Stretford End. He connected cleanly but it was handled dependably by Peter Schmeichel.",
      "The flurry of applause was for the attempt rather than the save. One United fan recalled another asking him why he was clapping a Leeds player.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson tells a story about picking Steve Bruce's and Gary Pallister's brains about Cantona as they relaxed in the dressing room bath after that 2-0 win. It was the only time Cantona ever played against United and he was back in Manchester two-and-a-half months later, this time to be introduced by his new club.",
      "Almost all of Ferguson's significant signings in the early years of the Premier League were top-flight players who had caught his eye. He wanted to sign Roy Keane as soon as the United scout Les Kershaw had watched him on his full debut for Nottingham Forest at Anfield in 1990. Andy Cole scored home and away against United in 1993-94 for Newcastle before his British-record move for £7m in 1995.",
      "Henning Berg was a title winner with Blackburn and Teddy Sheringham was United's scourge in a New Year's Day thrashing at White Hart Lane. Dwight Yorke was influential in one of United's most infamous defeats, the grey-kit grey day in the Villa Park sunshine in August 1995.",
      "United did not just dominate the Nineties on the pitch but in the domestic transfer market. When Ferguson decided to move for a striker in 1995, he considered Cole, Les Ferdinand and Stan Collymore. Ferdinand and Collymore moved to Newcastle United and Liverpool later that year.",
      "Back then, United had the pick of the lot. Now, as they have discovered with their opening offer for Bryan Mbeumo, they cannot just prey on top-flight clubs, particularly one as shrewdly run as Brentford.",
      "The list goes on well into the 2000s, from the ridiculous to the sublime: David Bellion, Louis Saha, Alan Smith, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Dimitar Berbatov and Antonio Valencia.",
      "Chris Coleman attempted to put up a fight when he was Saha's manager at Fulham. \"Over my dead body\" would Saha be sold. Coleman was very much alive when Saha moved for £12.6m in January 2004.",
      "John Gregory, Yorke's manager at Villa in 1998, was far more incendiary. \"If I'd have had a gun, I'd have shot him,\" he admitted upon learning that Yorke wanted to leave. The quote was referenced in Yorke's chant at United.",
      "\"I was rising at Villa, becoming the main man, the only place I'd have left Villa was to go to Manchester United,\" Yorke said. \"I got a phone call from (former manager) Brian Little, who had left the club and John Gregory was in charge.",
      "\"I got a phone call from the gaffer himself and Brian Little said, 'I think I might have got you a move.' And that's when the reality kicked in.",
      "\"It was really bizarre (with Gregory) and what was so bizarre about it was John Gregory was my go-to coach. Individually, I used to spend a lot of time practicing my touch and finishing and Gregory would be the one with me! He was losing his best player and felt aggrieved at that.\"",
      "United have largely eschewed Premier League recruits in recent years, before and after the Ineos cabal occupied seats in the Old Trafford directors' box. Erik ten Hag protested during his first pre-season in 2022 that he would rather sign Premier League-proven players but lamented their expense.",
      "Declan Rice and Harry Kane were on the market a year later but both slipped the net. United settled for Mason Mount, an outlier and a mismatch.",
      "After United parted with £80m to make Harry Maguire the most expensive defender in football in 2019, they did not buy a player from a Premier League club until Mount four years later. Cristiano Ronaldo had premium Premier League pedigree but returned after a 13-year absence. Christian Eriksen, a free agent, had demonstrated he could still hold his own during a brief spell with Brentford.",
      "United's prime three targets this summer were all attached to Premier League clubs. Matheus Cunha's release clause made his £62.5million switch from Wolves straightforward, Mbeumo wants to join United but Liam Delap did not.",
      "All three distinguished themselves against United. \"Cunha wowed the crowd with two virtuoso dribbles, the second halted by the booked Fernandes,\" this correspondent wrote at Molineux on Boxing Day. \"Cunha would slot into Amorim's 3-4-3, a formation that too many players already jar with.\"",
      "In November 2023, yours truly mused, \"Ferguson sought a Premier League specialist who was direct and familiar with servicing target men. While the focus is inevitably on Ivan Toney, if United are to telephone Brentford about a player it ought to be Bryan Mbeumo.\" Delap antagonised a number of United players in the royal blue of Ipswich Town.",
      "A sceptical friend suggested United's transfer strategy is mirroring Everton's under Ronald Koeman. Across the 2016 and 2017 summers, Everton bought Ashley Williams, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Yannick Bolasie, Michael Keane and Jordan Pickford, essentially the best players at mid-to-lower table Premier League clubs Swansea City, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Between those transfer windows, Everton drew 1-1 at Old Trafford and Koeman casually remarked he was \"more comfortable\" against United than at Liverpool. Five months later and back at the same stadium, Everton were trounced 4-0 by United.",
      "Jose Mourinho, a colleague of Koeman's from their time as coaches at Barcelona, was in a mischievous mood with his programme notes: \"I hope everybody knows today will be a tough game because we're up against a team that has spent £140m.\"",
      "That got under Koeman's skin at his post-match press conference and he accused Mourinho of not being realistic. Koeman was sacked a month later.",
      "United had bought from Everton that summer. Romelu Lukaku racked up 26 goals for a seventh-placed side that had finished a place below United. He got 28 in his first campaign in Manchester.",
      "Lukaku, of course, once scored a hat-trick against Ferguson's United. It was too late for Ferguson, though. It came in his final match in management at West Brom."

      "Buying Premier League proven players hasn't been a priority for Manchester United in recent years.",
      "United have tended to target foreign leagues in a bid to strengthen their squad, but there has been a notable shift during Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window at the helm.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a £62.5million deal, while there's hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will soon join him at Old Trafford. Liam Delap was the club's primary striker target after he hit 12 in his maiden Premier League campaign, though the Manchester City academy graduate opted for a move to Chelsea instead.",
      "Whether some of the signings United have made in recent years from foreign leagues have struggled to adapt to the pressures that come with being a United player or the Premier League in general is up for debate. But there's no doubting the fact that targeting players who have shown themselves to be capable operators in the English top flight reduces the risk of more wasted money.",
      "Having inexplicably made just one attacking signing last summer following a season where they finished with a minus goal difference, United are aiming to bolster their attacking options. In Signing Cunha and targeting Mbeumo, they could soon add two of last season's top Premier League marksmen to their squad.",
      "Mbeumo finished the campaign with an impressive 20 league goals, while Cunha bagged 15 for a struggling Wolves side. The pair finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers last season, with Mbeumo the fourth-highest goalscorer and Cunha tied on eighth with Chelsea's Cole Palmer.",
      "Should they get a deal for Mbeumo over the line, it would mark a real statement of intent from United.",
      "In fact, only one English club has ever added two new players to their squad in a summer after said players finished in the top 10 Premier League goalscorers.",
      "The only club to have done so was Tottenham back in the summer of 2001, when they brought Gustavo Poyet and Teddy Sheringham to White Hart Lane. The latter struck 15 goals for United in the 2000/01 season to finish as the league's sixth top goalscorer, with Poyet firing 11 for Chelsea before a £2.2m move across the capital.",
      "Spurs almost repeated the feat in 2012 when signing Clint Dempsey and Emmanuel Adebayor, but the latter finished in the top 10 scorers the previous season while on loan at Spurs, he simply made his move permanent in the summer.",
      "Poyet and Sheringham both hit double figures in the 2001/02 Premier League season having arrived at Spurs in the summer. If United sign Mbeumo and the former Brentford man and Cunha hit double figures in the league next season, United will be on their way to fixing their biggest problem."

      "Manchester United are no longer the clinical, threatening attacking team that once took the Premier League by storm. It's not a stretch to say that the forward line that ended the 2024/25 season won't be first-choice under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already signed to bolster United's attack, but the Brazilian isn't enough. A new centre-forward is as much of a priority as ever after Rasmus Hojlund's poor campaign, but nearly every club in Europe is fighting for a prolific goalscorer.",
      "United are putting all their eggs into Bryan Mbeumo, and after receiving the green light from the Cameroon international, the move has stalled. Tottenham's registered interest with Thomas Frank orchestrating their transfer business means the deal hasn't moved in the last week.",
      "There is still optimism that Mbeumo will leave Brentford and move to Old Trafford. Alongside Cunha, United are expected to head into the new campaign with an impressive attacking arsenal that includes Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount when fit.",
      "However, United have been here before. Signing players with impressive records - Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last term - for big fees and 12-15 months later, realising they either overpaid or the deal wasn't a smart piece of business. With the Brentford star, the early indications are that won't be the case, but the club can do their best to ensure that.",
      "First of all, secure the services of a goal-scoring striker that gives defenders nightmares. Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen both score goals for fun, and their ball-playing skills would be perfect for Mbeumo to run off and create opportunities himself.",
      "The quality around Mbeumo has to be better than what United fans were used to watching last season. Different wildcard options offer Amorim the ability to be flexible, such as playing Amad as an attacking wing-back - a role he excelled in last term.",
      "There's also little faith in Mount being Mr.Reliable this season after 46 games in two seasons. So what are the other options? In a world where transfer deals often spark a domino effect elsewhere, Mohammed Kudus could be the answer.",
      "Kudus is attracting interest from Premier League clubs including United and Chelsea. The playmaker, better as a No.10, is said to be open to leaving the London Stadium this summer and has an £85m release clause in his contract, which is valid to Premier League clubs for the first 10 days of next month.",
      "Now United certainly aren't desperate for another attacking playmaker. But adding another option in that position gives Mbeumo three (Cunha, Kudus and Fernandes) perfect partners in his position.",
      "In spite of all that, this is where Chelsea come in. Enzo Maresca's men are in the market for a new winger after deciding against buying Sancho, and Garnacho has been strongly linked with moving to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Negotiating a deal with the Blues which sees Garnacho move to Stamford Bridge would leave the door wide open for Kudus to move to United. A strong striker with the likes of Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes and Kudus all competing for a spot in the two No.10 positions is enough to take United from 15th to potential Champions League candidates."

      "If successfully extracted from the San Mames Stadium, Williams would almost certainly become Barcelona's first-choice left-winger. The Spanish outfit want to strengthen that position as a priority this summer and Rashford has also been on their radar.",

      "However, Villa have the option to sign him on a permanent basis for £40m, but they do not have first refusal. Their failure to qualify for the Champions League also hinders their chances of signing him permanently.",

      "Following a disastrous 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United have been left with no choice but to show some ambition in this summer's transfer window.",
      "After wrapping up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier this month, United now want to make Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo their second signing of the summer.",
      "The Cameroonian, 25, has informed confidants he wants to make the switch to Old Trafford this summer and United have already seen a £55m offer for his signature knocked back. However, discussions with Brentford are understood to remain ongoing.",
      "After developing a habit of signing Dutch-centric under former boss Erik ten Hag, United's recruitment strategy is changing for the better this summer. After signing Cunha and now being in hot pursuit of Mbeumo, it is clear they want proven Premier League talent.",
      "In Cunha, United have secured the signature of a specialist No.10 who fits Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation like a glove. He also scored 15 Premier League goals last season.",
      "By signing a player who has already developed a respectable track record for cutting the mustard in England's top tier, United will be hoping he can hit the ground running at the start of next season.",
      "Expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 berth, Cunha will be responsible for creating goals and scoring them. He had a direct hand in 21 goals in 33 league appearances in 2024/25, assisting six in addition to the 15 he netted himself.",
      "Mbeumo, who is being targeted to play as the right-sided No.10, exceeded Cunha's tally by five, helping himself to 20 Premier League goals. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22) got more.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, and it is exciting and refreshing to see United in pursuit of one of the division's best players. If he arrives at Old Trafford, he will, just like Cunha, be expected to hit the ground running.",
      "However, neither of them spent last season at a club where the pressure can be comparable with what it is at Old Trafford. That will be a big test of their character.",
      "But with Cunha having made it clear he wanted to join United and no-one else this summer, and Mbeumo prepared to turn down a reunion with Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur in favour of a move to Old Trafford, it says everything you need to know about their hunger to don the famous red shirt.",
      "Securing Mbeumo's signature would send out a real statement of intent. Although he is not the goalscorer United want to fill the No.9 spot, he would be joining them on the back of a 20-goal season, meaning they would expect him to contribute.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 Premier League goals or more in a single campaign since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13. A club of United's stature should be able to rely on a 20-goal-a-season man.",
      "Both Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo went close to scoring 20 Premier League goals in a single season in recent years, each falling short by two in 2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively. Marcus Rashford scored 17 league goals when he scored 30 times across all competitions in 2022/23.",
      "If Mbeumo were to join United and get anywhere close to reaching 20 goals next season, he would instantly enter the conversation to be ranked as their best signing post-Ferguson. Just getting into double figures, particularly when he is not an out-and-out centre-forward, would be considered a success for a debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "United need a natural goalscorer this summer to shoulder the attacking burden, but having a player of Mbeumo's quality and capability in front of goal would ease the pressure. The same can be said of Cunha.",
      "With no United player having scored 20 league goals in a campaign for 12 years, Mbeumo would be a significant upgrade on their current attacking options."

      "Thankfully, they have somewhat addressed the problem in front of goal. Matheus Cunha bagged 15 last season and Mbeumo scored a sensational 20 in the league. Not one player in United colours has scored 20 Premier League goals or more in a single season since Robin van Persie in 2012/13.",
      "Even with Cunha and Mbeumo through the door, United need a striker. It seems as though the shortlist has whittled down to three: Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen or Hugo Ekitike. Each has different sagas and United don't seem to be in pole position to land any of them.",
      "Alternatives like Jonathan David, Dusan Vlahovic, Vangelis Pavlidis and Jean-Philippe Mateta have been mentioned, all could still be signed. But United have plenty of time to get their act together and land one of the big-hitters.",
      "Osimhen rejecting Al-Hilal leaves the door open. Gyokeres 'prefers' Arsenal and Ekitike's £60m valuation for a striker with just 50 career goals doesn't tick many boxes.",
      "One way or another, a new No.9 is a priority. Rasmus Hojlund is better served for a temporary move away and Joshua Zirkzee, for many, has done enough to stay.",
      "United know they must sell players to raise funds. They also know that, with no European football to face this season, there's no need to have a large squad. But for Amorim, they need to successfully offload players that don't fit the Portuguese's system.",
      "Last summer, the likes of Donny van de Beek, Mason Greenwood, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Scott McTominay were sold. This year, the potential list of exits should contain some high-profile names.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho all spent the second half of last season out on loan and do not fit Amorim's system. Interest has been bubbling since the season ended but no move, as of yet, has materialised.",
      "Cashing in on the trio would be a good start. Having any of them part of the pre-season squad next month would be a difficult circumstance to overcome. The same can be said for Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "His career at United was over from the second he spoke out after Bilbao and reports before the season ended that he was told to leave the club added further uncertainty. Garnacho is arguably United's biggest asset and if they can come to an agreement with an interested party, their financial woes would look significantly better.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Andre Onana and Casemiro are all sellable players, but they are not players who should be fast-tracked out the door. Each of them will play some part for Amorim, whereas Rashford, Antony and Sancho all need to be moved on sooner rather than later.",
      "Onana's case is also quite interesting. If United can sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa, Erik ten Hag's signing will no longer be needed. But as is the case with every player, will there be much interest in Onana after an under-par campaign?",
      "If United sign a striker, Hojlund will have to be out the door. That may be a loan with interest growing in Italy, it's unlikely that they'll be able to receive any of the £72m they paid Atalanta in 2023.",
      "This is a to-do list and the biggest thing they have to do needs to be done by the middle of July. United head to the United States for pre-season next month and failure to ensure Mbeumo and a new striker are on that plane would be leaving Amorim out to dry.",
      "The new Premier League season may feel months away but before we know it, Amorim and Mikel Arteta will be greeting each other on the touchline at Old Trafford. Turning the attention away from the problems at United with their business this summer would be an easy early win."

      "Six of United's home fixtures will get the \"category A\" rating and cost between £59 and £97, with those being against Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Chelsea, and Arsenal. Leeds United will also be included in this top category, having been promoted from the Championship. The new model does not affect season ticket holders.",
      "Most of the remaining league games will be category B (£57-£86), with a couple in category C (£37-£60). Cup games will be in their own category D (£32-£52), and concessions will be available for all of these.",
      "United sources argue that the model reflects the demand for each type of game. The changes come after the worst season at Old Trafford in many peoples' lifetimes, and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust say that it's a \"kick in the teeth\", pushing regular supporters away, and threatens to price out future fans.",
      "Fans say they're not feeling good about the news in light of a grim year for the club. Reader Wiserds says: \"Sadly it's the same across all of football and will continue to be the case whilst footballers wages are so ludicrously and distgustingly high. There is no justification for the Premier League players receiving the salaries they do, other than other teams pay the vast sums of money.",
      "\"As others have wrote, the simple solution is not to attend, but whilst demand oustrips supply then I guess the casual supporter will always pay it. Football is slowly destroying its soul. The bubble will burst at some point in the future.\"",
      "Commenter Utd20T reckons the club misunderstands its own fans: \"I'm not surprised with the pricing... it's supply and demand. Dynamic pricing has been on the cards for some time. It doesn't effect me as a ST holder whereby we have had a modest increase, but I'm not naive enough to believe that we won't be next. Even though I don't feel the impact this season, it doesn't mean it's not wrong.",
      "\"Categorising games is a smokescreen... we are not a Man City who turn up for the derby, but pass on games against the likes of Fulham. Imagine the increases if we were actually a top 4 club, and if we get back to that, the increases will be eye-watering.\"",
      "Glazerclowns writes: \"If we had a decent team I could understand it to some degree, but after the shambles of a season just gone it’s a disgrace.\" Popepourri adds: \"'Top 6'… cheapest ticket is £59 and yet we are a million miles away from being a 'Top 6' outfit ourselves. That’s me done after 45 years plus... let the tourists have ‘em.\"",
      "Some are calling for a soft boycott, for fans not to buy tickets or merch to show their displeasure. Gortonboy says: \"Protests do not work, waving flags and banners simply show the owners that United have a passionate fan base there to exploit.",
      "\"The only, ONLY, way to change how the owners manage/invest in the club is by reducing the revenue going into the club, be that by not buying any form of merchandise or not buying tickets (including season tickets). Hard to do, easy to say, but continuing protests will never work.\"",
      "Stephenjh writes: \"Vote with your feet. If you keep paying, it will never change! Ticket touts have been making fortunes off match goers since time began! The reality now is that a business man is in charge now, and Man U should be taking people's money, not touts. Hopefully the touts will be moving on now.\"",
      "The situation reflects football as a whole, says DavebH H: \"Sadly it’s all about corporate and tourists now. Not just United but the Prem as a whole. These billionaire owners have taken the game, our game, out of our hands.\"",
      "Have your say! Does pricing games by demand make sense for Manchester United? Or will it lead to more fans becoming unhappier with the club? Comment below, and join in on the conversation."

      "Manchester United's transfer business is the talk of the fanbase at the moment, with the inventory of goal-scoring profiles available - and good enough - seemingly being shortened.",
      "It's plausible that United will end the summer transfer window with three attacking additions. Ruben Amorim's fluid 3-4-2-1 system is heavy on the three forward players, and last season, United didn't get the right balance.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored 10 goals in all competitions, and Joshua Zirkzee managed less. Alejandro Garnacho's occasional moments of magic came in glimpses. Bruno Fernandes scored 19 goals playing in both defensive and offensive midfielder roles and Amad, when not injured, scored 11 and assisted a further 10.",
      "Work has already started in handing Amorim the tools to get the most out of his forward three. Matheus Cunha, who scored more Premier League goals than any other United player last season, is already at the club after the club triggered his £62.5million release clause.",
      "A player who scored five more goals than Cunha is Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star appears to be the current priority for United to give Amorim two superb options behind the striker.",
      "It's understood that the 25-year-old wants to move to Old Trafford despite interest from Thomas Frank's Tottenham. A bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons has already been rebuffed, and Omar Berrada has already revealed the club's stance on being speedy in negotiations.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" he told United We Stand. \"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money.",
      "\"So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "On the face of it, United are taking their time in getting the deal over the line. The lack of European football and the club's worst season in 51 years mean United aren't at the luxury of paying over the odds to sign players.",
      "Once Mbeumo is signed, player sales will be a priority before a new striker is targeted with Viktor Gyokeres on their radar. Right now, United have time to negotiate the proper deal, but there's a deadline for Amorim to get his players in order.",
      "United kick-off their pre-season schedule on July 19 against Leeds United in Sweden, meaning the start date of training is expected at the start of July. Amorim's players will then travel to the United States to participate in the Premier League Summer Series, where they'll face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Last year, Erik ten Hag and his squad played out a similar schedule, with games against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool all taking place between July 27 and August 3. 12 months ago, United travelled stateside on July 24, three days before their first fixture against Arsenal.",
      "That would point towards United leaving Manchester for their tour on July 23. In an ideal world, United will have their three attacking reinforcements on that plane to the USA to ensure the best preparation for the new season.",
      "Under Ten Hag, only Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee were part of the pre-season squad. Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui both joined three days before the first game of the season, and Manuel Ugarte's arrival came after three games.",
      "Despite not being part of the preparations for the season, Mazraoui, De Ligt and Ugarte all played more minutes than Yoro and Zirkzee.",
      "It ended up costing Ten Hag and United's season. It can't happen this time around. United know they have to get the players in before they jet off to the United States."

      "Manchester United have reportedly made ‘initial contact’ with a goalkeeper who kept 18 clean sheets last season as an approach for current goalkeeper Andre Onana has been made by a European big hitter.",
      "United have seemingly given up on Onana after two seasons. In both his campaigns at Old Trafford, the former Inter Milan goalkeeper has made mistakes.",
      "In last season’s Premier League, he was at fault for three goals, and more in the Europa League.",
      "As a result, United are looking to go in a different direction, while also getting rid of Onana. According to Gianluca di Marzio, Monaco have ‘made an enquiry’ for the United keeper.",
      "It is not clear how much the Ligue 1 side would be willing to bid for Onana. However, Di Marzio states the goalkeeper who United ‘like the most’ is Atalanta’s Marco Carnesecchi.",
      "It is stated ‘initial contacts’ have been made with the goalkeeper’s agent, but not with his club, Atalanta, who it’s believed would not let Carnesecchi go without a satisfactory offer being made.",
      "The Italian kept 18 clean sheets last season – 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League. Only three men kept clean sheets more often than he did in the Italian top flight last season.",
      "As such, it seems Carnesecchi would be a good option, and is a solid alternative to Emi Martinez, who United might struggle to sign.",
      "It’s been suggested they are willing to pay £40million for him, and that they’ve been given good signs the Argentina goalkeeper wants to join, with multiple reports suggesting he’d look favourably on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But it has recently been reported that Atletico Madrid have the best chance of landing Martinez.",
      "Indeed, United and Atletico are said to be the two sides most likely to sign the keeper, but United are ‘ringing every day’ to try to convince him as it’s suggested his ‘preference’ is to go to Atletico as he wants to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "Atleti have Champions League football on offer, and United have no European football at all.",
      "That could similarly hurt them in pursuit of Carnesecchi, given he played in nine games of the elite European competition last season, and he’d play in it again next season if he were to remain with Atalanta.",
      "However, it’s unclear what the response has been from his agent to the approach from United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "Man Utd have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ...",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ringing an elite goalkeeper ‘every day’ in the hopes that he’ll choose them over a move to Atletico Madrid.",
      "United are in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana had a poor season last time out. The Cameroon international was at fault for three goals the Red Devils conceded in the Premier League last season, and more in other competitions.",
      "He has been given more than enough chances over the past couple of season, and United now want to go in another direction.",
      "They have been heavily linked with Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez of late, and it’s been suggested that a move for the Argentina international is progressing.",
      "It has been suggested for a short while that Martinez wants to sign for United, having said yes if Onana is to leave, per a report, which also states there’s been ‘positive feedback’ over a move for the keeper, who wants to leave Villa.",
      "But that Martinez wants to head to United has been thrown up in the air.",
      "A report from Football Insider suggests the Red Devils are ‘ringing every day’ to get a deal over the line in the coming weeks, as it’s believed Villa don’t have long before they need to sell Martinez due to PSR pressures.",
      "But the twist is that it’s believed Martinez actually wants to go to Atletico Madrid. They and United are said to be the leading candidates, but the Spanish side is his ‘preference’ as he’d like to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "There is said to be a fear at the Metropolitano about losing Jan Oblak, given the goalkeeper – who has played 494 times for Atletico – is the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Given a lot of reports have suggested that Martinez wants to go to United, there is seemingly confusion over where he actually wants to end up.",
      "Atletico have the pull of Champions League football, while United will not play any European football at all next season, so there is certainly good reason for Martinez to want to move to the Spanish side and not the Red Devils.",
      "If Villa are indeed planning to sell before June 30, when the books have to be finalised, then there will seemingly be an answer over where Martinez will end up at very soon.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly in ‘advancing in talks’ to sign Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who is open to joining if Andre Onana leaves.",

      "An Arsenal man has reportedly had ‘positive initial contacts’ with a European giant, but Liverpool could yet intervene in their potential transfer.",
      "Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has revealed he “obviously” wants to sign a “great player” in a damaging raid on Tottenham this summer."

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer. Here are the 10 best available.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli, it would seem. He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga or Serie A feels right.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer and after rumours of an exit, chances are he will sign a new deal.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 93 goals in 105 games. Bobbins league or not, that’s very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the window might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso gone, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a brilliant forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in 2022, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Perhaps the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games last season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there has been a real lack of interest.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but he reportedly wants to stay in Europe. Liverpool have been linked with a swap deal involving Darwin Nunez, which almost makes too much sense. We shall see.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",

      "Marcus Rashford and Manchester United will part this summer but one of his eight transfer options is even more unlikely than him staying at Old Trafford.",
      "The Manchester-born striker made his Premier League debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016 but the former fresh-faced wonderkid is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford.",
      "Having fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim, he spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but is back in Manchester, now looking for his next move.",
      "Here’s where we reckon Rashford could end up:",
      "",
      "After some depressing final months at Old Trafford, Rashford seemed to be back enjoying football when he moved to Villa Park.",
      "He contributed to 10 goals in 17 games as he and fellow loanees Marco Asensio played a part in Villa’s run in and push for the Champions League but a return for Rashford seems unlikely for 325,000 reasons.",
      "Villa are one of the clubs thought to be under most pressure from PSR rules but it is actually UEFA’s financial laws that could cause the Birmingham club a headache.",
      "From the 2025-26 season, UEFA say only 70% of a club’s spending can be on ‘squad cost’ which is the sum of first-team and manager wages, transfer fees, agent and intermediary costs and fees paid to pay off former players/managers divided by day-to-day income, incoming transfer player and manager fees and any other transfer income.",
      "In their most recent published accounts, Villa’s overall wage bill was £252m and their revenue £257.7m. So adding Rashford with his £325,000 salary to that equation seems silly.",
      "Verdict: Incredibly unlikely",
      "",
      "If Rashford returning to Villa seems impossible, him staying at Manchester United looks just as unlikely.",
      "But with an expensive contract that runs until 2028, Rashford would be within his rights to stay at the club and take home his pay cheque.",
      "However, with a World Cup next year, Rashford will want to play so he can be part of Thomas Tuchel’s England side.",
      "Verdict: Very unlikely",
      "",
      "Having offered his services to them in January, Rashford moving to Barcelona looked a real possibility this summer but developments in the last few days seem to have put an end to it.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported on Thursday that the Camp Nou club had agreed terms with Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams having long been interested in the Spain forward.",
      "The transfer, not to mention the money involved in, would see a player take up Rashford’s favoured spot, meaning his chance to move to Barcelona may have come and gone.",
      "Verdict: Unlikely",
      "If you glanced across any transfer rumour so far this summer, chances are Galatasaray have been mentioned.",
      "The Turkish side have been linked with almost every player going and reports of their interest in Rashford first emerged in November.",
      "A move to Villa cooled that link but with Rashford still on the market, Galatasaray could look to tempt him to Turkey to join a strike force which Leroy Sane will soon be a part of.",
      "Verdict: Possible",
      "",
      "Rashford need only ask Scott McTominay how a move to Italy can rejuvenate a career and Serie A has become somewhat of a rescue place for misfiring Premier League players.",
      "Of the Italian clubs, it is Inter who have been linked with the Sun suggesting the San Siro side were interested. But given it is the Sun that may well be incorrect.",
      "But wages may well be an issue. Inter’s current top earner is Lautaro Martinez on €320,000 a week, meaning Rashford’s £325,000 would make him easily the club’s best-paid player, potentially disrupting squad harmony and putting Inter under considerable financial strain.",
      "The Champions League final showed how Inter needed some younger blood to go with their experience and if they can get Rashford to drop his wages, they could make a move for him.",
      "Verdict: Possible (if Rashford drops wage demands)",
      "While the outrageous spending has curtailed somewhat, the Saudi Pro League remains a comfortable landing place for unwanted Premier League stars.",
      "To date, five English players have made the move to Saudi and Rashford may well join them if he cannot find a better move in Europe.",
      "However, for a player who has made a name for speaking up for good causes, it remains to be seen how he may feel about moving to Saudi.",
      "Verdict: Likely if no other offers",

      "With Son Heung-min reportedly facing a move away, Tottenham will be looking for some reinforcements on their left flank.",
      "The link to Spurs is nothing new with Rashford first being reported as a target in the winter before his Villa move and if Spurs can get him for a small fee, he could be a good squad option for new boss Thomas Frank.",

      "From a club perspective, Newcastle will be playing more games this upcoming season with them back involved in the Champions League and their options up front, especially centrally, look short.",
      "Alexander Isak is the obvious first choice but if the Swede is absent, Callum Wilson has been called upon. The 33-year-old’s injury record makes him an unreliable back-up and his contract expires this summer in any event, although negotiations are underway over an incentivised deal.",
      "Rashford then may feel he can force his way into the squad at the expense of Wilson and could even play out on the left, although competition there with Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes is again fierce.",

      "The Liverpool forward blitzed just about every record going as part of an incredible season which saw Liverpool win their second Premier League title.",
      "The Egyptian scored 29 times, six more than any other player, and also topped the assist charts with 18. That form makes Salah the overwhelming favourite but he has been joined by five other players on the season’s shortlist ahead of the final ceremony.",

      "One surprise nominee is Bruno Fernandes with his Manchester United team finishing 15th in the league table. The Portuguese midfielder though was perhaps the only performing player at Old Trafford, contributing to 19 goals last campaign.",
      "Cole Palmer also features despite having a poor second half of the season. The English midfielder scored 15 goals in the league last year but only three of those came in 2025. The 23-year-old was named PFA Fans’ Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year in 2024.",
      "One man who did not have trouble finding the net is Alexander Isak who has also reached the top six. The Swede scored 23 goals in 34 league appearances as Newcastle qualified for the Champions League.",

City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",

      "19) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’.

One Leeds would be daft to make.",

But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle.

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",

      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",

      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

      "=7) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",

      "=7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. So why the wait? Zubimendi is in the middle of three-week FIFA-mandated holiday, while reports suggest both clubs would prefer for the deal to go through the books in July.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

So we get to see most of the best players in the world, decent, competitive football, but still with some jeopardy.",
      "In this Club Cup abomination, where the Randomizer 2000 was used to deselect some of the best European teams and allow some marginal US teams, and where the better clubs can buy whatever they need to smooth out their weak spots and plenty of time to train and work out a system – there is no value, no real attraction in seeing part-timers dumped by ultra professionals. It’s not the FA Cup, either, with it’s history.",
      "In the World Cup, with the US being a smorgasbord of heritage, there might be interest in seeing either the US national team AND a team from the homeland. Being a club competition, there is no reason someone from say, New Jersey, is likely to want to support Los Angeles in a match against a team from South Korea. With the US being a vast country, it also doesn’t make it easy to follow your own team across the country and back either.",
      "And that’s before we consider the time of day, the fact that Americans receive significantly fewer vacation days (PTO, as it’s often called) than Europeans, and all the other major issues confronting the country. These same issues act as a significant deterrent for ‘foreigners’ attending these games – unless absolutely necessary.",
      "While I can understand that some sports journalists have a job to do, the amount of fawning over this competition is sickening. Much was made of the first game and opening ceremony, as well as articles implying that it is a very English attitude to be against this competition while the Latin world is loving it. Spanish is becoming the lingua franca of football, as if those same pundits had never been to Miami to realize it is a microcosm of the Latin American world. However, it is so different from the rest of the U.S.; for example, Chicago, Boston, and New York would have more Irish and Italian heritage. The point being that one decent crowd for the opener in Miami was not going to define this tournament.",
      "What’s worse is that teams like Man City, PSG, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Bayern, who already have dominated their national leagues through fair or foul means (more foul than fair) will come out of this with considerably more financial ammo to dominate their leagues into the future.",
      "While I dislike the ‘transfer season’ and the influx of ‘never heard of before’ journalists claiming that every player under the sun is going, not going, u-turning, or batting their eyelashes at your team, it is still preferable to this tournament that primarily serves to feed the ego of that insufferable tw*t, Infantino.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "It’s no good if the Champions of England, Spain and Italy are not there, you say? That’s surely the most irrelevant of your largely irrelevant points.",
      "First off, who cares? Secondly, who really f**king cares?",
      "The entry criteria for the tournament isn’t about National champions unless you’re the host nation. Why do I feel like your gripe is actually about the absence of the Champions of England, the bestest league in all the lands in all the worlds. Merely including others to make it sound more reasonable but you fool only yourself.",
      "Besides, the qualification cycle for this tournament doesn’t include the 2024/2025 season. It’s 2020/21 to 2023/24. So really the only champions of England – Man City – for the relevant period are there. Even if they aren’t, it’s still wouldn’t matter. Because it’s not about league winners.",
      "Italy, the European champions at the time, didn’t play at the World Cup in Qatar. Because it’s a different tournament, with different qualification criteria.",
      "Literally the only good thing about the CWC is the maximum two per country limit unless a country has more than two continental champions. The cynic in me believe this would probably be tweaked in future versions to enable more European heavyweights to participate but I hope it stays as it is (it won’t).",
      "And don’t get me started on the complaints about player welfare. Yes it’s becoming a really big problem but not one uniquely created by the CWC. It feels like just another excuse to criticize the tournament.",
      "How does the actual World Cup or any other summer tournaments address the issue of player welfare? Does the CWC make it worse in any way? No, it’s exactly the same.\nAY (You don’t have to watch it if you don’t like it, not many are watching it anyway)",
      "",
      "Return of the diddy men (Ed – surely there’s a better phrase?)\nBack in the day, football was much simpler, you were either an artist or an artisan, and by artisan I mean borderline thug. Think Norman “bite yer legs” Hunter or Ron “chopper” Harris (where have those colourful nicknames gone?).",
      "Conversely, the artists were, by and large, slight. Pele was only 5′ 8″ and both George Best and Dennis Law were both 5′ 9″. Then somewhere along the way it all changed and gave rise to the athlete. Thierry Henry was 6′ 2″ and built like a sprinter. And more followed, Drogba, Van Persie, Shearer, all over 6 feet tall.",
      "Yes the old maxim “if you’re good enough, you’re tall enough” still applied, but you had to be bloody good otherwise it was men against boys.",
      "As boring as “tiki taka” was, you have to give Guardiola credit for putting the smaller, technically gifted player back on the map, yet, in a flash they were gone again. And after seeing the manchild Haaland chew up the Premier League, I feared football was going to go the way of American professional sports.",
      "So it was refreshing to see PSG and Barcelona lead the way back with their Diddy Men. Vitinha and Neves bossed the CL final and Barcelona’s seem to have an almost endless supply of Gavi’s and Pedri’s. It seems like only in the English Agricultural League where these players don’t appear to cut mustard. It’s questionable if even Paul scholes would make it in the EPL these days. And we all know that Messi wouldn’t be able to “do it” on a cold Tuesday night in Stoke!",
      "So, fast forward to the 2026 World Cup, being played in the heat of the American summer. What are going to be the chances of the gut busting runs of Haaland, Mbappe, etc. going to fare against the economical styles of possession based teams?",

      "Amorim is working hard with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to revamp a United squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "Matheus Cunha has joined the club in a £62.5m move from Wolves and they’ve reportedly made an improved £60m+ bid for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo after their opening offer of £45m plus £10m in add-ons fell short, but a fresh report claims a transfer U-turn may see the Cameroon international ‘choose Tottenham’ for ‘obvious reasons’.",
      "It’s widely expected that United will have to make significant sales this summer in order to provide Amorim the cash to make the changes he wants and the club is working hard to find buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho ended last season as the club’s second top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions, to go with ten assists, but was told by Amorim to source a new club at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli remain keen on the 20-year-old, whom United reportedly want £70m for, while Chelsea, Aston Villa and Tottenham are also said to be interested, but the Serie A giants may instead move for Sancho, with reports suggesting the winger has ‘verbally agreed’ to a move to Naples.",
      "Marcus Rashford has done everything possible to seal his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, but the Catalans look set to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club as their new left winger.",
      "Newcastle are thought to be keen on Rashford amid reports of a huge Liverpool bid for their striker Alexander Isak.",
      "There is reportedly ‘growing optimism’ from both Real Betis and Antony that he will prolong his stay with the La Liga side after his impressive return of nine goals and five assists in the second half of last season.",
      "United are said to want £34m for the Brazilian but Betis have proposed a deal which would see United claim a significant percentage of any future sale as it’s thought they can only stump up £17m as an initial payment.",
      "But Stretty News report that Antony also has admirers from the Premier League, claiming: ‘Our sources can also confirm that Aston Villa and Brentford have enquired about Antony, but the tricky winger has clearly given his preference to Betis.’",
      "The Sun claim that if any of the quartet have failed to find a new club by the time United fly to the States in July for their pre-season tour they will be left behind to train alone at Carrington.",
      "A club source said: “Amorim is stamping his authority on the club. It was hard arriving mid-season but he now has the opportunity to shape the team in his image. And he’s wasting no time.",
      "“He only wants players who would die for the shirt and are on board with his ideas.",
      "“He also wants a smaller squad to create an intimate team bond so that everyone gets enough game time to be at peak fitness when called upon. He doesn’t want any bad apples or distractions.”",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",
      "Man Utd have lost the Europa League final, leading to calls for the end of the Ruben Amorim experiment. So who next?",

      "He’s definitely ‘not untouchable’, though, and will be sold if a ‘good proposal for all parties’ arrives.",
      "Romano says:",
      "Saudi Pro League clubs maintain interest in Onana and that’s a potential scenario. No proposal has arrived on Man United’s table yet, but this story could develop later this summer and so the club is maintaining a close eye on opportunities for the goalkeeper position in case anything changes with regard to Onana’s future.",
      "Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has been on United’s shortlist since March and is another option being considered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s transfer team.",
      "However, there has been ‘positive feedback’ internally that gives the green light for a move for Martinez.",
      "There have been ‘initial contacts’, and the 32-year-old reportedly ‘wants to leave Aston Villa’ after an emotional farewell on the penultimate Premier League weekend.",

      "Vardy is 38, which makes him very much a signing for the present, and a one-year deal is surely the only sensible option for the Red Devils. We’re not saying he has to be signed and given the No.9 shirt. No, he’d take on a Jonny Evans-like role, mentoring the rather hopeless-looking Rasmus Hojlund into a proper fox in the box, turning Joshua Zirkzee into an actual No.9, and helping Matheus Cunha score even more goals.",
      "The only natural striker Ruben Amorim has right now is Hojlund, a £70million investment United surely aren’t ready to chuck in the bin for a shiny new toy. Having already missed out on Liam Delap, United need a cost-effective striker who can relieve some pressure on Hojlund’s still-young shoulders.",

      "The two-cap England international is in his prime and has proven he can play both right- and left-back. That sort of versatility should land him a decent move. There were so many options that we eventually settled on Aston Villa.",

      "His days as a Premier League starter are behind him, but Eriksen still offers a superb creative spark off the bench. He created 2.63 chances from open play per 90 in the 2024/25 Premier League; only Bruno Fernandes, Bukayo Saka and Kevin De Bruyne created more.",

      "Victor Lindelof to Wolves\nLike Walker-Peters, this one almost involved drawing names out of a hat. Bournemouth were our first pick, then Everton were considered (they do love a United cast-off), and then we looked at the promoted trio of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland. In the end, we landed on Wolves.",
      "They’re set to lose Craig Dawson and are severely lacking quality at centre-back, so Vitor Pereira could do a lot worse than a player who spent eight years at United looking a bit out of his depth.",

      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "19) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s essentially no chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "17) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",

      "15) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "14) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nSee Marco Silva.",
      "",
      "13) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",

      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "10) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "Dunno, so it’s into mid-table Maresca must slot. He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans.",

      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of this list but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "What you may notice we’ve cleverly avoided here is any attempt at predicting what we actually think Man United will actually do next season in terms of being good/bad/indifferent. And that’s because we genuinely have not one clue. Could be anything, couldn’t they?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",

      "6) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, but again, that doesn’t really matter for our purposes. Arteta’s is a quirky situation where the range of possible outcomes is such that he sits uncommonly prominently in this list but would be even closer to the top of any possible manager of the year list.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "5) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games, Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo. There’s also the added early-season headache of those Conference League qualifiers, too, which none of our other European entrants have to worry themselves with.",

      "4) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack. As with Arteta – perhaps even more so – what we’re doing here isn’t quite as straightforward as ‘do you think this manager will do well or what’.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "1) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",

      "Monaco are interested in signing Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "The French club are understood to be exploring the conditions of a deal for the 29-year-old.",
      "Onana has been linked with an exit this summer after making numerous high-profile errors at Old Trafford.",
      "He has three years left on his contract having joined from Inter Milan for £47.3m in July 2023.",
      "Onana has made 101 appearances in all competitions across his two seasons at Manchester United.",
      "He was part of their FA Cup win in his first campaign and featured regularly last term but only started one of United's last four Premier League games, with Altay Bayindir playing in his place.",
      "According to Opta, Onana's total of eight errors leading to goals in all competitions since the start of the 2023/24 season is the second-highest of all Premier League players, behind only Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.",

      "Thursday 19 June 2025 20:30, UK",
      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",

      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "And that means City could be without both players for these league encounters, including the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on January 17, were either nation to make it as far as the semi-finals:",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
