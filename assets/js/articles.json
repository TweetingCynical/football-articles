      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes was on hand to offer praise and advice to one of the club's young talents after an impressive showing in training. It comes amid news that Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim has made plans to trim his squad further by placing three players on the transfer list.",
      "Fernandes impressed with his display in last weekend's 2-1 win over Chelsea, with the skipper marking two big milestones over the course of the match, scoring his 100th United goal in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "His performance came after a difficult few weeks for the Portugal international, who has struggled to find his best form after being moved into a deeper role by Amorim this season. However, Fernandes is still highly regarded as a leader by those at the club and beyond, and he showed his class in training this week with an interaction with academy product Sam Mather.",
      "It comes as three of Fernandes' team-mates were identified as likely departures in 2026, with Amorim prepared to let the trio go as he cuts down the bloated squad he inherited from previous United head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "After his impressive display against Chelsea, Fernandes looked full of energy in training again this week, with an official report on the United website saying the Portuguese star displayed \"an astonishing amount of precision, and sometimes cheek, when rifling opportunities into the net on a regular basis\".",
      "However, one moment in training saw the midfielder celebrate the talents of another player, with Mather impressing the first team skipper with a fine effort during a shooting drill.",
      "According to the same report, the 21-year-old \"connected sweetly\" with the ball to \"thunder one shot low into the bottom corner of the net\" during training at Carrington.",
      "The goal was enough to see the academy product earn \"personal praise\" from Fernandes, with the former Sporting CP star impressed with what he was watching.",
      "Salford-born Mather, who plays on the wing, has featured in United's Premier League 2 side, but was keen on a move away from the club over the summer, with his heart set on playing senior football. He was reportedly in talks with Turkish side Kayserispor over a deadline day move, but that failed to materialise.",
      "United boss Amorim is also set to show three senior players the exit door in 2026, and the trio will walk away for nothing.",
      "After selling the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony on permanent deals over the summer and letting others, including Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana, leave on loan, more big names are set to depart to free up funds to help improve the Red Devils' midfield.",
      "With club bosses keen to slash the wage bill, Casemiro is set to lead the departure list when he becomes a free agent at the end of the season. Having been signed for £70 million from Real Madrid in 2022, he has been a regular under both Ten Hag and Amorim but now looks set to leave on a free.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another who will become a free agent next July, having moved to Aston Villa on loan for the 2025/26 campaign. Signed for £73 million three years ago, he is also set to walk away for nothing with United unlikely to trigger the option to extend his contract by a further year.",
      "Also seemingly heading for the exit door is left-back Tyrell Malacia, who has endured a torrid time with injuries since moving to Old Trafford for £13m in 2022. After a summer move to Turkey fell through, he looks set to leave on a free as well.",

      "Sam Allardyce was pictured alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in Manchester United's win over Chelsea – and he has opened up on how they largely talk tactics when they're watching games together.",
      "The former Premier League manager, whose most recent job was with Leeds United, was in attendance to watch the Red Devils secure just their second win of the campaign. He was alongside an Old Trafford regular in Ferguson with the pair having gone up against each other numerous times in their careers.",
      "Both men were managing back in the 1990s and have seen the game develop into what it is today.",
      "Much was made of the dialogue between the two individuals and Allardyce claims the majority of their chat centred around the game as well as what changes they would make.",
      "He said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast: “We talk about why we think United have dropped off, talk about how they need to push up.",
      "\"There are things we chat about in general about what’s happening in the game, and say what we think. Do we think they’ll get a sub on?\"",
      "United's win came with both teams down to ten men after Robert Sanchez and Casemiro were both sent off in the first half.",
      "The Brazilian dismissed for two yellow card offences, which led to a tense finish for the hosts, and Allardyce admits he'd have hauled off the veteran midfielder.",
      "He said: “I would’ve taken Casemiro off after his yellow. Have you seen how many times he’s been sent off? A man of his experience and his age who can’t control himself, he’s just an old player. He’s not an experienced player.",
      "“He’s been doing the same things for all his career that he should’ve cut out years ago, and particularly now he’s not as quick as he used to be, he should be using his experience to make sure that doesn’t happen, but he’s not. He’s doing the same old things he’s always done, diving in, jumping in.\"",
      "Despite Ferguson and Allardyce often going up against each other the Scot did have admiration for the one-game England manager, who remains a friend.",
      "Back in 2010 he was hugely critical of Blackburn's decision to axe him when they were lying 13th in the top flight.",
      "\"I've never heard of such a stupid decision in all my life,\" said the ex-United boss. \"I don't know what they're doing up there, but deary me. It confounds common sense. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",

      "Aston Villa are already reportedly planning to sign Jadon Sancho permanently from Manchester United less than a month after loaning the winger. Sancho has impressed in short spells at Villa Park since arriving from Old Trafford.",
      "The former England international has managed 82 minutes across two matches for Villa, with both coming as a substitute. However, he will hope that involvement increases over the coming weeks and months after Sancho joined Villa late in the transfer window after a summer of uncertainty.",
      "Chelsea decided to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so the player spent pre-season training separately from United's first team squad.",
      "The club would have preferred to see Sancho leave permanently, but, despite interest from Italy, they could not find a deal that suited both club and player. Sancho is in the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, but United can extend his deal by another year.",
      "According to National World, Villa are trying to take advantage of that situation. Emery is pleased with what he has seen so far from Sancho.",
      "The Midlands side also secured a free transfer from United this summer. Victor Lindelof arrived at Villa Park after his contract expired.",
      "Since Sancho arrived at Villa, Emery has set ambitious targets for the winger. The Spanish boss believes a recall to the England squad under Thomas Tuchel could be on the cards - the forward has managed just one appearance since his United switch in 2021.",
      "\"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best, Emery said earlier this month. \"And if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team.",
      "\"Every player wants to be part of the national team. When he was at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic.",

Antony made a triumphant return to Betis following a successful loan stint there last season, sealing a permanent move in the closing stages of the summer transfer window.",
      "Since his full-time switch to Spain, the Brazilian has featured in both league matches and bagged his first goal against Ange Postecoglou's side on Wednesday night. In the 15th minute, Antony demonstrated his creative prowess by setting up Cedric Bakambu's opening goal.",
      "Despite Igor Jesus putting Forest ahead with two goals within five minutes, Antony emerged as the hero of the night for Manuel Pellegrini's squad. He scored a well-executed equaliser in the 85th minute.",
      "Sancho, who also left the United 'bomb squad' over the summer, was among those excluded from Ruben Amorim's team and had to train separately from the main squad alongside Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. The winger joined fellow Premier League side Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season.",
      "On social media, Sancho captured Antony's late equaliser against Forest and posted: \"Hermano! *fire emoji* *clapping hands emoji\". 'Hermano' is Spanish for brother.",
      "Antony has since replied to the message. Reposting Sancho's response, he added in a caption reading \"High foot\", along with eyes, and laughing and red heart emoji, he also tagged both Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Antony's European exploits for Betis follow his instrumental role in guiding them to the Conference League final last season. He netted four times and provided three assists before falling at the final hurdle to Sancho's Chelsea.",
      "Betis made a concerted effort to sign Antony during the summer transfer window, with the deal appearing to be off at one stage. A potential move to Saudi Arabia was rumoured, but it was consistently reported that Betis was his preferred choice.",
      "His start with the Spanish side since completing a permanent move has been slow with no goal contributions in his first two La Liga games. Antony will hope that the equaliser against Forest will now kickstart his season.",

      "However, Antony emerged at the far post during the 85th minute and saved Manuel Pellegrini's side from embarrassment on home soil. Spanish outlets celebrated the 25-year-old's wing play, as he earned widespread praise for securing a dramatic late equaliser.",
      "Betis Web praised Antony for refusing to \"give up in a match against some real beasts.\" Accompanying their 7/10 rating, they even tipped him for a future captaincy role as they said: \"He didn't care [who he was facing]; his courage and attitude kept the team going. Today he was the captain without the armband.\"",

      "This local reaction demonstrates the Brazilian's commitment to rediscovering his best form since departing United. The £80million star lost his place at Old Trafford following his arrival from Ajax in 2022, but has undoubtedly re-established himself in Spain.",
      "Antony secured a permanent switch to Betis in a deal worth £19m, following a successful loan spell last season. After the match, the winger confessed that recent months had been exhausting but expressed satisfaction with the match outcome.",
      "He said: \"Tired. The last three months have been very difficult for me. I've been training with the team for two weeks now, and it's still a bit difficult, but here at home, with our fans, we wanted the three points.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly identified two potential alternatives to Carlos Baleba, should they fail to strike a deal with Brighton.",
      "The Red Devils initially expressed their interest in the midfielder during the summer transfer window, but were met with a firm response from the Seagulls.",
      "Brighton had no intention of parting ways with the player, and would only entertain offers in the region of the £115 million they pocketed from the sale of Moises Caicedo to Chelsea back in 2023. This led United to abandon any potential deal.",
      "United could, of course, rekindle their interest when the January transfer window swings open, hoping that Brighton might soften their stance. However, it appears that the club are already exploring potential alternative options.",
      "Both players have made their way into the England squad over the past year. Anderson started both of the Three Lions' matches during the recent international break, impressing with his performances in the number six role.",
      "He has also turned heads since making the move to Nottingham Forest from Newcastle United last summer. His performances played a key role in helping his club secure European football this season.",
      "Wharton has also been instrumental in his club's success, being a member of the Palace squad that hoisted the FA Cup last season.",
      "United are not anticipated to be the sole club eyeing up the pair when the transfer window swings open in the new year, with Manchester City also reportedly showing interest in Wharton.",
      "Forest and Palace are also predicted to put up a strong fight to retain their star players, particularly as both teams are participating in European football this season.",

      "Joe Cole believes Elliot Anderson's time at Nottingham Forest will only last so long with the midfielder tipped to take another step forward in his career. The England new boy made another stellar impression on the European stage as his side were held by Real Betis.",
      "Forest were denied the win in Spain by a late Antony equaliser, but the former Newcastle star still showcased his quality in the middle of the park. Anderson has continued to take huge strides forward and excelled as the Nottingham outfit secured European football last term.",
      "Manchester United are among those linked with him as they look to address their flaws in that midfield area.",
      "Anderson's exploits caught the attention of Thomas Tuchel and the Forest man recently made his debut for the Three Lions. That came after a summer where he helped the U21s defend their title at the Euros.",
      "Cole is now backing the 22-year-old to feature for England at the World Cup next summer, picking out qualities in his game that make him a must have, and insists his rise will likely see him leave Forest.",
      "\"I've watched him many times, I see something in him, he's a winner. There was a moment at the U21 Euros when he was dropped for a game and then he come on and scored the penalty and there was an anger in his face. There's a belief in him, the way he goes into tackles.",
      "\"And I think as a player I'd want Anderson in my team next to me, and I think Tuchel sees that, I think he's put himself in pole position. If he keeps playing like he is tonight, if he keeps on at his trajectory, the sky is the limit for the kid.\"",
      "Anderson's ability to dictate play in midfield is likely to make him hugely sought after. He moved to Nottingham from Newcastle for £35million but his current employers could command double that if he was to move on.",
      "Tuchel is tasked with making England champions of the world and the German has hailed Anderson's attributes after his debut in white recently.",
      "“He’s just a very, very good football player,\" he said. \"He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels.",

      "Manchester United are ready to let three expensive Erik ten Hag transfer flops walk for nothing - to help kickstart the Ruben Amorim era.",
      "The United boss replaced Ten Hag in 2024, inheriting a bloated squad filled to the brim with underperforming, expensive stars. That has contributed to a miserable first 12 months for Amorim, who has picked up just nine wins from his 32 Premier League matches in charge.",
      "Amorim managed to move on a number of high-profile players during the summer window, with Alejandro Garnacho and Antony leaving permanently. There were also loan moves for Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Andre Onana and Jadon Sancho - all of whom are unlikely to continue their Old Trafford careers next year.",
      "And the Sun report that more players will be shown the exit door in 2026, to help free up funds for a big midfield signing. United opted to spend heavily on attacking reinforcements this time around, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving for a combined fee of more than £200m.",
      "That did mean that other areas were not improved upon, most notably at the heart of their midfield. There were huge calls for a new central midfield player to be added to help the implementation of Amorim’s strict 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United were heavily linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but despite exploratory talks, a deal was deemed too expensive. The Seagulls value the Cameroon international at £115m and would be the marquee signing of next summer’s window.",
      "The Sun report that United bosses are ready to sanction another swathe of big-name exits, to help slash the wage bill before another splurge in the transfer market. Casemiro would lead that departure list with the 33-year-old set to become a free agent at the end of the current season.",
      "The Brazilian has been a regular both under Ten Hag and Amorim, but after a fantastic first season, has struggled to replicate that form. He has remained a regular under Amorim, but showed his limitations with a damaging red card in the recent win over Chelsea.",
      "United signed Casemiro for £70m from Real Madrid in 2022 and remains one of the club’s highest earners. The Red Devils do retain an option to extend his current contract for a further year, but he now looks increasingly likely to be leaving on a free.",
      "Sancho was an even more expensive misfire by the previous regime, signing for £73m in the same summer as Casemiro. He has failed to play a league match for United in over two years, spending much of that time away on loan.",
      "He is currently attempting to rebuild his career with Aston Villa, but will be a free agent next July - with United unlikely to trigger the 12-month option in his deal.",
      "And Tyrell Malacia is another almost certain to move on having been the only member of Amorim’s ‘bomb squad’ not to secure a summer exit.",
      "The left-back was signed for £13m, becoming Ten Hag’s first signing but has endured a torrid time with injuries. He looked certain to be leaving during the most recent window, but saw a move to Turkey collapse.",
      "Like Casemiro and Sancho, he will be able to leave on a free next year. But one player looking increasingly likely to STAY with United is former captain Harry Maguire.",
      "The England international became the world ’s most expensive defender when he arrived from Leicester in 2019. And despite falling out of favour under Ten Hag, has the backing of his current head coach.",
      "United triggered a contract extension earlier this year to keep him under terms for this season and now hope to tie him down to a longer contract - albeit on lesser terms.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that his time at Birmingham City was an 'absolute car crash', pinpointing the exact moment he knew that it would not work out at St Andrews. Following the culmination of his playing career, Rooney went into management but found it difficult to replicate his playing successes in the dugout.",
      "Derby County, DC United and Plymouth Argyle all employed Rooney. But it was the former Manchester United, Everton and England striker spell at Birmingham under their American ownership which ended in the worst possible manner.",
      "In just shy of three months, Rooney managed to win only two matches and he was quickly sacked at the beginning of January having not been given the opportunity to sign a single player of his own. In a sit-down interview with former United teammate Rio Ferdinand on his 'Rio Ferdinand Presents' YouTube channel, the 39-year-old admitted that the spell in the West Midlands was particularly bad",
      "\"I think I took very difficult jobs,\" Rooney said. \"Obviously, I was at Derby [as a player] and then I went in as manager and then they went in administration.",
      "\"Then I went out to the US and managed DC United, which people actually think and talk about that as if it was a big failure. DC United finished bottom the three seasons before I went in, and then we missed out on playoffs by a point, and then when I left, they went back to the bottom and people don't talk about that.",
      "\"Then I went to Birmingham, which was an absolute car crash from day one, to be honest. The fans never said that.",
      "\"I remember we played Middlesbrough away in the first game, we lost 1-0 in the 90th minute. Then we played Hull at home.",
      "\"I remember I walked out and my first game at home, and I'm stood there, and the players are shaking hands and I'm over there. And there was a Birmingham fan behind me: 'Get back to America, you fat c***.'",
      "\"I turned around, I was laughing. I turned around, I was like, 'give me a chance'.",
      "\"And so that was just never right at the time of when I went in. It was just never... It weren't a good fit.\"",
      "Rooney's comments come after Birmingham co-owner Tom Brady questioned his work ethic in the dugout. Speaking on the Amazon Prime documentary Brady & The Blues: Birmingham City which released last month, the NFL icon was filmed saying to business manager Ben Rawitz: “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic.\"",
      "After being sacked from his most recent role at Plymouth on New Year's Eve, Rooney's attention has been drawn away from management. The former striker now appears to be focusing on a career in punditry after joining the freshly revamped Match of the Day.",
      "He also features in a BBC podcast - The Wayne Rooney Show - alongside Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd. He has also appeared on the Stick to Football podcast alongside his ex-United teammates Gary Neville and Roy Keane while also joining Amazon Prime's coverage of the Champions League.",

      "Manchester United will hope the 2-1 victory over Chelsea last weekend breathes new life into their season. Being knocked out of the EFL Cup already and not partaking in European football this season means Ruben Amorim's men will have had a week's break by the time they take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "The Premier League clash at the Gtech Community Stadium follows the recent action-packed win at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. United made the extra man count following goalkeeper Robert Sanchez's early red card for the Blues, before Casemiro himself was sent off on the stroke of half-time.",
      "Harry Kane could make his return to the Premier League next summer due to a reported secret clause in his contract. The England captain joined Bayern Munich two years ago and remains under contract until June 2027.",
      "But German outlet Bild reports Kane could be available for a cut-price of £56.7million next year, provided that he informs Bayern of his decision to leave before the end of the January transfer window. Such a request would come as a surprise given Kane has settled in well in Bavaria, winning the first trophies of his career and already scoring eight goals this season.",
      "But a return to the Premier League after the 2026 World Cup, at which point he will be 33 years old, would give him the chance to break Alan Shearer’s record as the English top flight’s all-time leading goal scorer.",
      "United, having tried to sign Kane in the past, could be keen to snap up the former Spurs star, despite Amorim's revamp of his attacking line-up with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They may also face competition from Tottenham, given their first-option agreement from when they facilitated Kane's transfer to Germany in 2023.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has admitted he would love to take on the Manchester United job. The 44-year-old has enjoyed a growing reputation in Germany for his work with the Bundesliga side, having led them to the Champions League.",
      "Premier League fans may know him as the head coach that managed to get the best out of Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom sealed big money moves to the English top flight this year. And Toppmoller has suggested he wouldn’t turn down a move to United if he was offered Amorim’s job.",
      "“Basically, it’s a dream to be at Eintracht now,” he said, as per Bild. “It’s simply a fantastic club. Here, as a teenager, I witnessed for the first time that my father was a Bundesliga coach. That naturally creates an emotional bond with a club.",
      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice someday, because it’s an extraordinary club.",
      "“When I was a teenager, Manchester United was, along with Real Madrid, the biggest club of all.”",
      "The manager received a big money offer to join Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad in the summer, which he rejected. And he is already familiar with Manchester, should he replace the under the pressure Amorim at Old Trafford, having joined Manchester City on loan in 2001 - though he did not make an appearance for the club.",

      "Antony was Real Betis' inspiration as the Spanish side held Nottingham Forest to a 2-2 draw in the Europa League on Wednesday night. Ange Postecoglou's side dominated proceedings in Seville, but were denied victory by Antony's equaliser.",
      "Antony left Manchester United in a £21.65million permanent deal on transfer deadline day, having enjoyed himself on loan in Spain last season. While he flopped following an £82m transfer from Ajax to United, the Brazilian has already become a hero at Betis.",
      "Forest were celebrating a return to European football for the first time in nearly 30 years, but couldn't secure the first win of the Postecoglou era as the former Tottenham boss made it four games at his new club without victory. Forest striker Igor Jesus scored twice, yet it was Antony who had the last laugh.",
      "The Betis winger first found Cedric Bakambu, who opened the scoring with a powerful finish into the roof of the net. Jesus equalised with a tap-in before putting Forest 2-1 up with a header from a corner.",
      "But Antony popped up at the back post in the 85th minute to equalise before celebrating by pointing to a tattoo on his neck which reads “iluminado\" - a Portuguese word which translates as “illuminated” or “the chosen one”. Betis fans certainly won't be arguing with him after another crucial performance which means he has nearly passed his total of goals and assists for United in a fraction of the time with his new club.",
      "United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cited Antony as the sort of missteps in the transfer market that he wants to eliminate now Ineos have taken over the club. \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying [Jadon] Sancho,\" Ratcliffe told the BBC.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out. Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid. But for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time. We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future.\"",
      "United made a huge loss in selling Antony to Betis this summer and his performances in Spain won't please Ratcliffe if they continue. With United not playing in any European competition this season, having finished 15th in the Premier League last season and lost the Europa League final, the petrochemicals billionaire had to go elsewhere for his football fix on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe was spotted in the stands of his other club, Nice, but it wasn't happy viewing for him in the south of France either. Nice were beaten 2-1 by Roma in the Europa League thanks to goals from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.",
      "United will be back in action this weekend against Brentford when Ratcliffe will hope they can build on their 2-1 win over Chelsea. He may secretly be hoping that Antony's form for Sevilla stalls, while Onana, Hojlund and Sancho will be trying to prove him wrong while on loan at Trabzonspor, Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",

      "Mee came through the ranks at Walsall but the 22-year-old moved to Manchester in 2019. After continuing to impress in the youth ranks he was invited to train with the first-team once he was 18 and engaged in a competition with Fernandes.",
      "The young goalkeeper was tasked with saving two of five shots from the Portuguese playmaker with the prize being a signed shirt from the United captain. Mee failed, but Fernandes still produced a shirt regardless with his gesture leaving its mark on him.",
      "United put out a video on social media with players asked to recall their favourite Fernandes moment and the goalkeeper recalled: \"Probably say when I was about 18, first time I went up and trained with them, he gave me a bet - If I could save two out of five of his shots he'd give me a signed shirt. I didn't do it but he went and got me one anyway.",
      "In an effort to go and further his development Mee, who is yet to make an appearance for the Manchester outfit, has had loan spells in non-league with the likes of Witton Albion and Altrincham. The goalkeeper has previously travelled to San Diego for a training camp and pre-season friendly against Wrexham.",
      "Fernandes has long been regarded as the team's talisman and a host of his team-mates referenced other major moments during his United career. Several players talked up his free-kick against Arsenal last season, a game that finished 1-1.",
      "The 31-year-old also enjoyed a memorable moment at Old Trafford against Liverpool back in April 2024, which too was referenced by the likes of Kobbie Mainoo. Fernandes was quick to seize on a mis-placed pass by the Reds and hammered home a shot first time.",
      "His effort caught Caoimhin Kelleher out of position and levelled a contest that eventually finished 2-2. Other moments included a hat-trick scored by the playmaker against Real Sociedad last term in a 4-1 win in the Europa League.",

      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has suggested he would like to take over at Manchester United in the future. Toppmoller has only worked in Germany during his coaching career so far but has now openly stated his desire to test himself at United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been an underwhelming appointment at United and has been unable to shake off the pressure on his job. The Portuguese boss has won just 19 of his 48 matches in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November, finishing a lowly 15th in his debut season.",
      "Amorim retains the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos for the time being, but he is only another succession of poor results away from that stance changing. And Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring if the United hierarchy do end up looking for a replacement.",
      "“Basically it's a dream to be at Frankfurt. It's simply a fantastic club,” he said on the Phrasenmaeher podcast. “Here, as a teenager, I witnessed for the first time that my father was a Bundesliga coach. That naturally creates an emotional bond with the club.",
      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice some day because it's an extraordinary club. When I was a teenager, Manchester United were along with Real Madrid the biggest club of all.”",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich assistant manager has won 46 per cent of his matches since becoming Frankfurt boss in July 2023. He has helped develop stars like Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, who have both moved to the Premier League in big-money transfers, while establishing Frankfurt in the Champions League.",
      "The 44-year-old is highly regarded in Germany and his side caught the eye by thrashing Galatasaray 5-1 in their first match of the Champions League group phase. They are currently sixth in the Bundesliga having won two and lost two of their opening four games.",
      "Amorim eased some of the pressure on him by beating Chelsea 2-1 in the league on Saturday and now faces key matches before the October international break. United travel to Brentford this weekend before playing Sunderland at Old Trafford the following week.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney maintained that his concerns around Manchester United's future and his subsequent bust up with Sir Alex Ferguson is a question that \"still hasn't been answered\".",
      "The club's great goalscorer was poised to sign a new deal in 2010 but wanted clarity on the club's direction after he'd seen his fellow forwards Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez both sold by the Red Devils. United had just lost the league title to Chelsea and Rooney wanted to know who they were signing.",
      "Ferguson didn't take kindly to his authority being questioned and the pair clashed, leading to Rooney putting in a transfer request. The saga lasted just a matter of days before the Evertonian penned a new contract.",
      "But looking back Rooney claims his concerns were later realised. The Manchester outfit won the top flight in 2011 and 2013, but with an ageing squad that lacked the superstar talent of yesteryear and Rooney believes no answer has ever been offered as to what the club's plan was.",
      "He said on Rio Meets Wayne: \"I think that question I asked then, in 2010, it still hasn't been answered, been addressed, from 2010. And I think fans have seen... I don't think, if fans look back, they'd be like, you know what, he actually seen what was coming a little bit. And I don't think it's been fixed since 2010.\"",
      "United have failed to even challenge for the title since 2013 with David Moyes and Louis van Gaal coming in after Ferguson, but both men were left to transition an ageing squad. Huge sums were spent, but recruitment has been a major issue with Rooney holding on to the fact that his concerns in 2010 were legitimate.",
      "He added: \"Well, if I look back to 2010, I don't think it has. I don't think, we obviously won the league in 2013, but lots changed, obviously. Commercially, social media, everything changed. But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years.",
      "\"But from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards who... Look, before my time, with Teddy, with Solskjaer, Coley, Yorkie. Then you've got me, Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov, Saha. From that moment, the club has never had a group of forwards who can all play and come win you games. And that is Man United.\"",
      "Rooney admits with the benefit of hindsight maybe his decision to challenge Ferguson wasn't right, but ultimately claimed \"I still think I had a right to ask the question.\" The forward was unsure whether the club were entering a period of transition, which ultimately has proven to be the case.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Tuchel's decision to look elsewhere has come with Mainoo becoming a frustrated figure at Old Trafford at his lack of action. He has struggled for regular starts under Amorim and his career has gone backwards in the last 12 months. And amid his frustrations, Mainoo remains keen - should things not improve at United - to seal a loan move in the next transfer window.",
      "The 20-year-old has made just four appearances this season and started just one game, United's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat at minnows Grimsby.",
      "Mainoo wanted to depart in the summer as he looks for more regular action, with Amorim having seemingly decided he's in direct competition with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a midfield place. But club bosses rejected his pleas for a loan move.",
      "He accepted the decision and has been working hard to get himself back in favour. But despite United's poor start to the new campaign, Mainoo has discovered that little has changed.",
      "Amorim held private talks with Mainoo last week and was told he is still part of his plans, while being challenged to do more to fight for his place in the team.",
      "While Tuchel has made it clear he will not considering calling Mainoo into his squad until he has secured more minutes on the pitch. Thus, Mainoo has accepted he will have no choice but to request another loan move elsewhere in January, should he still find himself on the fringes of Amorim's team.",
      "Mainoo is desperate to be on the plane for next summer's finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico and he knows there will be no chance of this happening if he continues to be on the outside looking in at United.",

It's bad because we're two kids from Croxteth, and then we grew up together and obviously we started dating and got married and have kids. But when I was 17 she could see, she knew my mind and she knew I was a bit out there.",

      "Travis Binnion named Obi on the bench for the opening Premier League International Cup game. The U21s have a busy schedule this month and the decision was made to give Obi a rest.",
      "Obi played the full 90 minutes in a league victory against Liverpool last Sunday. The U21s were still able to claim a 2-1 win against Bilbao to get their PL International Cup campaign off to a flying start at Old Trafford.",
      "Bilbao were leading 1-0 and were comfortable until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark.",
      "Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Biancheri provided an assist for James Scanlon and scored a late match-winner in added time.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",

      "United officially announced Torpey as the new head of the academy an hour before the game. Torpey previously worked with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together in the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "Torpey has the credentials to work in the academy of the 'greatest football club in the world', having excelled during his time at City and Brentford, but he will do well to emulate Nick Cox, who will leave behind a wonderful legacy when he becomes Everton's technical director at the end of the week.",
      "Perhaps Torpey's first observation was that Ruben Amorim's formation is not used by Travis Binnion, which has been questioned by some fans who argue it makes sense to use 3-4-3 from top to bottom.",
      "Darren Fletcher has made a superb start to his time in charge of the U18s and also does not use Amorim's formation. The U21s and the U18s are top of their respective leagues.",
      "\"It's a collective approach to decide how the academy team is going to play, so it's not my choice,\" he said. \"There's conversations between myself, Jason Wilcox, the senior coaches within the academy in terms of Trav Binnion, Dave Hughes, Adam Lawrence and Colin Little.",
      "\"We talk about the type of football that our boys will need to experience to give them a well-rounded education, which is going to equip them for the game, not just to get them to the start line and for them to make a debut, but these boys will still be playing around 2045 and 2050.\"",
      "Could the youth teams change formation now Torpey has succeeded Cox? It's possible, but it would be a huge shock to change the youth team's systems during the campaign.",
      "The priority for Torpey will be attempting to ensure there is no disruption from Cox's departure. United's academy has arguably been the only area of the club that has functioned well in recent years.",
      "United's U21 manager Binnion has been a hugely important cog in the academy system over the last few years and he named an interesting team to face Bilbao, starting Chido Obi on the bench partly due to rotation and partly to see how he would handle being rested.",
      "The U21s secured a 2-1 victory over Liverpool last weekend and Binnion rotated accordingly, but United looked like what they were in the first half against Bilbao: a team without their best players on the pitch.",
      "It didn't take long for Bilbao to open the scoring through Asier Hierro. The young striker finished into the bottom right corner at the Stretford End with a brilliantly struck free-kick. The Spaniards went into the interval with a one-goal advantage, but they had created enough chances to be leading by three.",
      "It wasn't until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark that United were able to produce quality in the final third. Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzergald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Ibragimov came close to scoring within seconds of entering the pitch - and Biancheri picked up the ball down the right a few minutes later. The youngster skipped down the wing and created a tap-in for James Scanlon.",
      "Biancheri didn't stop there and scored in the last seconds of added time to seal a late comeback. The goal meant United made the perfect start to the Premier League International Cup's group stage.",

      "The 20-year-old wanted to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request. The MEN have been told Mainoo did not want to leave his boyhood club permanently, and only wanted a loan for the sake of regular minutes in an important season.",

      "Sancho has played 82 minutes across two matches for Villa after completing his switch and will hope to soon have a bigger role, having spent pre-season training separately from United's first team squad.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star joined Villa late in the transfer window after a summer of uncertainty, following Chelsea's decision to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than make his loan permanent at the end of last season.",
      "United would have preferred to see Sancho exit the club permanently but, despite interest from Italy, they were unable to find an option that suited both club and player.",
      "That will have proven frustrating for United, with Sancho now in the final year of his contract at Old Trafford. The club hold an option to extend his deal by a further year, but it is almost certain not to be triggered as they attempt to offload his salary.",
      "It appears Villa are plotting to take advantage of that situation, with manager Emery being happy with what he's seen so far from Sancho, according to National World. The Midlands side also secured a free transfer from United this summer with Victor Lindelof arriving at Villa Park after his contract expired.",
      "From the outset of Sancho's move to Villa, Emery has had high expectations. The Spanish coach envisions a possible England call-up for Sancho under Thomas Tuchel - the attacker has earned just one cap since signing for United in 2021.",

      "Sam Allardyce was spotted sitting next to Sir Alex Ferguson during Manchester United's victory over Chelsea – and he has revealed how they often discuss tactics while watching matches together.",
      "The former Premier League boss, whose latest role was at Leeds United, was present to witness the Red Devils claim only their second triumph of the season. He sat alongside Old Trafford stalwart Ferguson, with the duo having faced each other on countless occasions throughout their managerial careers.",
      "Considerable attention was paid to the conversation between the two men, and Allardyce reveals that the bulk of their discussion focused on the match and potential substitutions they would implement.",
      "Speaking on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, he explained: \"We talk about why we think United have dropped off, talk about how they need to push up. There are things we chat about in general about what's happening in the game, and say what we think. Do we think they'll get a sub on?\".",
      "United's triumph occurred despite both sides being reduced to ten players after Robert Sanchez and Casemiro received their marching orders in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "The Brazilian was dismissed for accumulating two yellow cards, creating a nervy conclusion for the home side, and Allardyce confesses he would have substituted the midfielder. He said: \"I would've taken Casemiro off after his yellow. Have you seen how many times he's been sent off? A man of his experience and his age who can't control himself, he's just an old player. He's not an experienced player.",
      "\"He's been doing the same things for all his career that he should've cut out years ago, and particularly now he's not as quick as he used to be, he should be using his experience to make sure that doesn't happen, but he's not. He's doing the same old things he's always done, diving in, jumping in.\"",
      "Despite Ferguson and Allardyce frequently clashing during their managerial careers, the Scot maintained genuine respect for the one-cap England boss, who continues to be a close friend. In 2010, he was scathing about Blackburn's choice to sack him whilst they sat 13th in the Premier League.",
      "\"I've never heard of such a stupid decision in all my life,\" declared the former United manager. \"I don't know what they're doing up there, but deary me. It confounds common sense. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",

      "Manchester United are prepared to let three of Erik ten Hag's costly transfer flops leave on a free transfer, in an effort to usher in the Ruben Amorim era.",
      "Amorim took over from Ten Hag in 2024 and was left with a squad packed with high-priced, underperforming stars. This has led to a disappointing first year for Amorim, who has managed just nine victories from his 32 Premier League games in charge.",
      "During the summer window, Amorim succeeded in offloading several big-name players, with Alejandro Garnacho and Antony departing permanently. Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Andre Onana and Jadon Sancho were also sent out on loan, all of whom are unlikely to continue their Old Trafford careers next year.",
      "According to The Sun, more players will be shown the door in 2026, to help free up funds for a significant midfield signing. United chose to invest heavily in attacking reinforcements this summer, with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joining for a combined fee of over £200m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "This meant that other areas were not strengthened, particularly in central midfield. There were strong calls for a new central midfielder to be brought in to aid the implementation of Amorim's rigid 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United were strongly linked with Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, but despite preliminary discussions, a deal was considered too costly. Brighton value the Cameroon international at £115m and he could be the headline signing of next summer's window.",
      "According to The Sun, United chiefs are prepared to authorise a series of high-profile departures in an effort to reduce the wage bill ahead of another spending spree in the transfer market. Casemiro, who is set to become a free agent at the end of this season, is expected to be at the forefront of these exits.",
      "Despite having a strong first season, the Brazilian has struggled to maintain that form under both Ten Hag and Amorim. He continues to be a regular starter under Amorim, but his limitations were exposed when he received a red card in the recent victory over Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro was signed by United from Real Madrid for £70m in 2022 and remains one of the club's top earners. While United have the option to extend his current contract for another year, it seems increasingly likely that he will leave on a free transfer.",
      "Sancho, who was signed for £73m in the same summer as Casemiro, has been an even bigger disappointment. He hasn't played a league match for United in over two years, spending much of that time on loan.",
      "He is trying to revive his career with Aston Villa and becomes a free agent next July. It's unlikely that United will activate the 12-month option in his contract.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also likely to move on, being the only member of Amorim's 'bomb squad' who didn't secure a summer exit.",
      "The left-back, who was Ten Hag's first signing for a fee of £13m, has had a difficult time with injuries. Despite being on the brink of a move to Turkey in the recent transfer window, the deal fell through.",
      "Like Casemiro and Sancho, he will be free to leave next year. However, it seems increasingly likely that former captain Harry Maguire will remain at United.",
      "Maguire, who became the world's most expensive defender when he joined from Leicester in 2019, still retains the support of his current head coach. Earlier this year, United activated a contract extension to keep him for this season, and they now hope to secure him on a longer contract, albeit on reduced terms.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire has leapt to the defence of Luke Shaw after he came underfire from Roy Keane following the defeat to Manchester City earlier this month. United were underwhelming in the Manchester derby, losing 3-0 to their fierce rivals. And, unsurprisingly after such a heavy loss, the critics were out in force to pick apart the Reds' failings.",
      "One man who caught particular criticism from Keane was Shaw. The former United captain insisted the full-back, who is currently being utilised in a three-man defence, 'gave up' allowing Phil Foden to score. Addressing those criticisms after defeating Chelsea a week later, Shaw admitted: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin.",
      "\"He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player.",

      "\"After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts.\"",
      "Maguire is obviously no stranger to being criticised while playing for United. When he was captain, the Englishman was often mocked online, taking the criticism of him to a whole new level.",
      "In an interview with United's official club website after surpassing 250 appearances for the club, Maguire defended Shaw.",
      "\"You don’t play at this club 250 or 300 times if you’re first and foremost not a good player,\" the centre-back explained.",
      "\"Luke’s an excellent footballer, and every manager that comes in, he gets questioned a lot. That’s what happens at this club.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Alvaro Carreras has been earning plaudits from his new Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso as his value continues to sky rocket.",
      "Carreras was on the books at Old Trafford from 2020 until 2024 after being picked up by United's academy from Real Madrid. However, the Spaniard was not given much of a chance to impress in the first-team.",
      "The left-back never made a senior appearance for the Reds and was loaned to Preston North End and Granada before an eventual spell at Benfica revitalised his career. After enjoying half a season in Portugal, Carreras signed permanently with them in the summer of 2024.",
      "His only full season in Portugal proved to be a hit and Real chose to strike while the iron was hot and snapped the full-back up. Now back in the Spanish capital, Carreras has been impressing and Alonso cannot help but praise the former United man.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising, it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras has not missed a minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season and that form has led to his value sky-rocketing.",
      "According to transfermarkt, Carreras has a market value of £30.5m after being snapped up for £43m in the summer by Real. United full-back Diogo Dalot meanwhile, who has been an ever-present at Old Trafford and has been utilised at both right and left wing-back prior to his injury, is only worth £26m in the current market.",
      "As for Patrick Dorgu, who was signed by Ruben Amorim to be the first choice on the left flank, he has a current market value of £21.8m. After Carreras signed for Real in the summer, United did manage to bank an extra £7.5m thanks to their sell-on clause but they may well come to regret selling him.",

      "The strip's black base includes yellow and blue details, nodding to the away kit worn between 1993 and 1995. However, at Brentford, United will wear a unique kit to comply with the rules on kit clashing.",
      "Ordinarily, the kit would contain black shirts and shorts to match the shirt. However, the Reds will wear yellow socks for this game due to Brentford's black shorts and socks.",
      "It's a similar move to what Arsenal had to do when they travelled to Athletic Club in the Champions League last week. The Gunners' away kit contains dark blue and back with the shorts and socks the same colour, but they were forced to wear white socks and shorts due to them clashing with Athletic's home strip.",

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Manchester United remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd made a late move for Baleba, 21, in the summer transfer window after spending over £200million on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder. Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder,” he told The United Stand.",
      "Jacobs added that Man Utd did a lot of “legwork” in August, making it very unlikely they will walk away from their pursuit of Baleba next year.",
      "“One of the reasons they (Man Utd) did all the legwork over the final weeks of the window was to try and put themselves in the strongest possible position, because I think they will be moving for Carlos Baleba,” he continued.",
      "MORE: Man Utd choose ‘elite’ manager as ‘prime candidate’ to replace Amorim amid two reasons for verdict",
      "“You don’t commit to what would have been potentially a 100 million-plus spend and then just walk away, because there’ll be a point in 12 months’ time where that player is for sale.",
      "“Even though many may feel 100 million is a lot of money, and something that could get a deal done, Brighton’s data and approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moises Caicedo-type fee, 115 million or more in 12 months’ time.",
      "“That projection of value effectively priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anybody bidding, because Brighton felt no one is going to match the valuation, and therefore the player is simply not for sale.",
      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",

      "Wharton has impressed for Palace since signing from Blackburn Rovers in the January 2023/24 transfer window.",
      "Bought for an initial £18million, his outstanding form for the Eagles has seen his value soar to €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, though Palace are likely to only entertain offers worth at least £60m.",
      "Wharton was rewarded for his fine form with his England debut in June 2024 and a spot in Gareth Southgate’s squad for last summer’s European Championship.",

      "READ: Man Utd ‘leading race’ they’re going to lose to Man City, Liverpool for three midfielders",
      "Wharton showed elite mentality to bounce back from his international disappointment with a fantastic 2024/25 campaign, helping Palace win the FA Cup and finish 12th in the Premier League.",
      "He has been a crucial player under Oliver Glasner, who lost Ebere Eze to Arsenal in the summer transfer window after Eze scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.",
      "Glasner kept hold of club captain Marc Guehi after his transfer to Liverpool fell through, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wharton also stayed at Selhurst Park.",
      "Wharton was linked with a move away in the summer, but nothing materialised amid reported interest from Man Utd.",

      "Asked on The United Stand if Liverpool are interested in signing Man Utd-linked Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Jacobs dropped the transfer bombshell regarding the Palace and England youngster.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder,” he said. “Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",

      "“In the same way that Eberechi Eze, even though it wasn’t his release clause, was allowed to depart even after the release clause expired. I think Wharton could leave Crystal Palace next summer.”",
      "Jacobs also says that Man Utd could add two midfielders next summer after failing to land £100m-rated Baleba, with Bruno Fernandes potentially moving to Saudi Arabia and funding a big transfer window not ruled out.",

      "Instead, as Scholes put it, Rashford ‘quit on United’. Whether he was exasperated or not, the evidence offers no other conclusion.",
      "Over 18 months, Rashford’s actions and demeanour spoke of a player who steadily gave up on his club. Repeated disciplinary breaches, the barely-arsed body language… the writing was on the wall long before Henry Winter posted it on X.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived last November, Rashford was certainly not alone in giving the impression that just going through the motions was too much to ask.",
      "The rotten standards prompted anger from supporters towards many players, most notably Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho. But those faces are quickly forgotten. The disappointment and regret over Rashford inevitably lingers.",
      "No doubt he was held to a higher standard. Hardly unfair when you consider Rashford’s pedigree and his status as one of the club’s highest earners. But in the end, the bare minimum was too much bother, an attitude that prompted some sympathy, some acrimony, but now mostly apathy towards the one-time local hero.",
      "“I really struggle to feel happy for him,” said Scholes, a stance that angered Steady and a few more besides. Including The i’s Pete Hall, who writes that Scholes’ criticism and previous narratives around Rashford amount to ‘bullying’. Knowing Pete, once of these parts, that’s a genuine belief. And given his leaning towards United, it highlights that no view on Rashford is unanimous.",
      "The witch-hunt in the right-wing media which attempted to smear Rashford amid the activism that prompted so much pride among United fans – that was bullying. Calling out his woefully-slipping standards as a footballer, one awarded one of the highest contracts in the history of his club, is not.",
      "So there are plenty of Stretford Enders who would echo Scholes’s sentiment. And that’s a reasonable reaction – human, even – in the circumstances. Only the most bitter would take satisfaction should Rashford flop at Barcelona, but neither should United fans be made to feel as though they ought to be cheering him on at the Nou Camp after he chose the path of disinterest out of Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford’s thunderb*stard at Newcastle in the Champions League last week will have caused many eyes in Manchester to roll. For United fans know better than anyone how Rashford is capable of such moments of brilliance having witnessed plenty for themselves. But those eyes will have rolled all the way back when news emerged of what followed next.",
      "With a brace at St James’ Park to build upon following an otherwise inauspicious start at Barca, Rashford turned up late for duty the following matchday. By two minutes, apparently.",
      "The level of his tardiness does not matter, especially when it is part of a pattern of behaviour. When you have unquestionably fallen upwards to a club as prestigious as Barca, where judgements are still being drawn by a new, hard-to-please manager, team-mates and fans, it is damning that it did not occur to him to be in at 9am, rather than skirting close enough to the 9.30am deadline to miss it.",
      "Damning but no longer surprising. Which goes a long way to explaining why Scholes and many others are returning the indifference that dripped off Rashford as he sloped towards the United exit.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch.",
      "Newcastle United beat Bradford City 4-1 and that really does prove a ‘masterstroke’ from Eddie Howe.",
      "Eberechi Eze could be the genius Arsenal need but will he be allowed? He would probably get the chance at Liverpool.",
      "Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko are most at risk of being cast in one of the early season’s most embarrassing and undesirable modern roles.",
      "Liverpool’s performances this season have only been good enough for eighth place in the Premier League."

      "However, a move did not accelerate as Man Utd were unwilling to do business with Daniel Levy, so Kane joined Bayern Munich instead in a deal worth around £86m.",
      "Kane, unsurprisingly, has been a revelation at Bayern Munich, scoring 98 goals in his 103 appearances for the German giants. He has also won his first team trophy under Vincent Kompany, lifting the Bundesliga at the end of last season.",

      "The report claims that he is ‘expected to leave’ Bayern Munich next year, as he is ‘eager’ to return to the Premier League, while Man Utd are ‘potential suitors’.",
      "As well as Kane, Man Utd are also said to be looking to the future with their transfer business and Africa Foot are reporting that they have turned their attention to ‘Senegalese prodigy Mouhamed Dabo’.",

      "The teenager is said to be ‘on trial’ at Man Utd and while Barcelona are ‘closely monitoring the situation’, he is ‘very close to signing’ for the Red Devils.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The player has been playing at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for several weeks, where he’s been training with the youth teams. According to our information, the feedback has been very positive. The English club’s coaching staff has been impressed by his all-around skills: clean tackling, vision, composure, ball control, leadership, relentless work, progressive passing, and pace control.",
      "‘FC Barcelona hasn’t said its last word. The Catalan club is also closely monitoring the progress of Mouhamed Dabo, who completed a month-long internship at La Masia, Barça’s famous training centre, as revealed exclusively by Africafoot at the time. Seduced by his performances, the Spanish club is keeping a close eye on the case, even if Manchester United seems to have taken a head start.’",
      "According to reports, Harry Kane has already reached an ‘agreement’ for his next move amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Gary Neville is doing his best to suggest Harry Kane might move to any other Premier League team other than Tottenham. Chelsea, anyone?",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "Harry Kane reportedly has an exit clause in his Bayern contract that could attract the attention of Premier League clubs Man Utd and Spurs.",
      "Marcus Rashford winning the Ballon d’Or would be the most Manchester United banter era thing to ever happen."

      "Now you might reasonably ask what XPts are.",
      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",
      "In a basic approach, xPts is calculated by simulating each shot in a match.",
      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are ‘notably unhappy’ with the ‘frustration’ over Ruben Amorim’s contentious system and philosophy at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out but there are still widespread concerns over his 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford, and ahead of that win it was claimed he was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’, with ‘senior players’ questioning his tactics.",
      "Ratcliffe was at Carrington to meet with Amorim ahead of Sunday’s game, with Amorim joking that he was there to offer him a new deal.",
      "“New contract, he was offering me a new contract,” Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe’s visit.",

      "Bailey said: “They’re happy with what’s happened over the summer – the players brought in, the system he’s implementing — and the main focus is seeing progress on the field.",
      "“And we are already seeing it: they’re a much better team than when he first took over, though admittedly they couldn’t have been much worse.",
      "“The club is backing Amorim. Jason Wilcox has fully bought into his approach, and the squad is being shaped in Amorim’s image. There’s little point in cancelling the experiment now — that would set the club back even further.”",
      "But the report adds that ‘Ratcliffe and his lieutenants are notably unhappy with the number of leaks around players voicing their frustration with Amorim’s system’.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave an update on Wednesday, from what he’s heard, on Amorim’s future at Man Utd.",
      "He said: “There is certainly appreciation for names like Oliver Glasner, but the sign that Amorim is still being backed is that there has been no outreach yet. There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",
      "“Manchester United still want to try and make it work with Ruben Amorim. That’s why he is likely to get a few more games, at least, before some of these other names perhaps come a bit more seriously to the fore if results don’t go according to plan for Amorim.”",

      "The United performances this season, featuring an inept Manuel Ugarte and a foolhardy Casemiro over wantaway Kobbie Mainoo in the double pivot with Bruno Fernandes have confirmed a need that seemingly everyone but the Manchester United decision-makers viewed as either priority one, two or three over the summer.",

      "It’s claimed ‘Manchester City could look at that position to ease the workload of 2024 Ballon d’Or winner Rodri’ in a possibility we can’t imagine Nico Gonzalez will be too fond of as he works to prove himself as a serviceable backup to his Spanish compatriot.",
      "While reports suggest United will reopen talks with Brighton over Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are also on the Red Devils’ shortlist, but in an increasingly unimaginative transfer market in which top clubs chase the same players, placing particular value on homegrown talents like Anderson or Wharton, we can also assume they’re on City’s.",
      "And we wonder whether Liverpool’s likely push for Wharton as a backup for Ryan Gravenberch, having been linked with the Palace midfielder in the summer amid their apparent bid to provide Arne Slot with two brilliant footballers to choose between in every position, may in fact bring about a situation where United have to settle for current top target Baleba.",
      "As Fabian Hurzeler said at the weekend, Baleba is “not a machine” and there is a “responsibility” for Brighton to help him rediscover his form having had his head turned by United to such a degree that he doesn’t look worth the £23.5m the Seagulls paid for him in the summer of 2023, let alone the nine-figure sum they’re now asking for.",
      "A similar trajectory which saw Evan Ferguson fade into anonymity having been linked with a big-money move to United would presumably lead even the hive-minders at Old Trafford to plump for one of the two alternatives, but interest from City and Liverpool in those same players would surely result in United finishing last in a race they’re currently leading.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Ben Jacobs says Man Utd-linked midfielder Adam Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement” with Crystal Palace, meaning he can leave the club next summer.",

But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years, but from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards like that.",

They haven’t had a group of forwards where, like, if I’m playing, I’m not playing well, and you’ve got Berbatov on the bench, or Tevez at times on the bench, Saha— you’re like, “I need to play well now.”",
      "“Now, There’s Højlund, Zirkzee, that’s it. Like, I feel for them, because in my opinion, they should be coming into games and winning games later on and having an impact off the bench. But they’re getting asked to play all the minutes and try and win games for the team, and there’s no back-up to it.",
      "“And there’s no— sometimes when you’re going through a bad period, sometimes it’s actually alright for the manager to take you out and say, just stay away. You’re not going to play— you might be on the bench— but just to take that pressure off you. And if you’re not scoring. So it’s… I honestly don’t think it’s been addressed, since then.”",

      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice someday, because it’s an extraordinary club.",
      "“When I was a teenager, Manchester United was, along with Real Madrid, the biggest club of all.”",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Danny Murphy recently admitted that he doubts Amorim will last until the end of his contract in 2027 but reckons there has “been some progression” at Man Utd this season.",

There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",

      "Because if you haven’t put yourself through each and every rubbish match they have played over the last 4-5 years, and then check that Rashford does play a few games a season quite well, you will wonder why Rashford is being targeted. But as someone who really really liked Marcus Rashford, and has put himself through each and every minute of each and every game since 10-15 years now, let me tell you why Scholes is just saying what every fan feels.",
      "Marcus is a local lad, who burst through and gave United fans hope that this is the next Academy player to be a star. He had great talent, was an amazing human and had the right values. So when he walks around the field for 80% of the match, literally not putting 2 steps to the right to try and defend or even fake defend when United don’t have the ball, and is one of the laziest players I’ve seen to grace the pitch, right up there with Martial and the 40 year old Ronaldo playing for Portugal currently. And while the Ronaldo case is easier to understand and the rest of the team work 10% harder to accommodate him at the age of 40, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the United team should suffer because Marcus cannot be bothered to do a proper job.",
      "On the edge of his own box, with the ball in front of him, he will just walk around and let the opposition players take shots or walk past him with ease. In EACH AND EVERY MATCH. It’s extremely annoying to watch regularly.",
      "Twice or thrice a season, he will put in a performance where he is energetic, runs with and without the ball, and his decision making is on point. But the rest of the time, he is one of the most lazy, infuriating and abysmal players on the pitch. Then comes his off-pitch behavior of being late, going partying, not working with the team agenda in mind, when he was the poster boy for Manchester United, it all mixes together to bring a feeling of sadness and regret at what he could have been and what he has become. The massive wages United gave him play a part in this downfall and for that I blame the management and board.",
      "The only reason I am excited for Rashford scoring or playing well for Barca is so United can scam 30 million pounds off for him, which no one in their right minds would otherwise pay along with his stupid wages. May he excel at Barca and find his peace there. I genuinely wish him well, and unlike Scholes I am happy for him if he finds a home in the beautiful city of Barcelona.\nAman",

      "I don’t think Matt Stead understands how culture is embedded within large organisations or in society at large.",
      "To take Arteta and Arsenal as an example – I’m an Arsenal fan and don’t believe the culture is perfect at Arsenal. However I believe we can agree that Arteta has improved it since he arrived.",
      "Which demonstrates that the manager sets the required culture (standards), the players have to fall in line and if they don’t the manager needs to be backed by senior leaders to enforce the required standards. This starts with disciplining the players and if they continue to misbehave they need to be removed from the team and the club. This has what has clearly happened at Arsenal.",
      "At Utd both Ten Hag and Amorim have set standards. They started by disciplining players (dropping them/fining them) then moved to excluding them and then selling them. This was clearly backed by senior leadership who allowed multi million pound assets to lose value by excluding them from the first team.",
      "Therefore the managers and senior leadership have done their jobs in maintaining culture and standards.",
      "In conclusion what is left are the players that did not uphold Utd’s standards and culture. And although it could be argued that what they are paid is irrelevant, my argument would be that a) employees earning 25k a year are expected to adhere to company standards b) chief executives earning 10m a year are expected to adhere to company standards. Therefore people earning 15m a year certainly should be.",
      "If they don’t, it’s no one else’s fault. And tbh the state this country is in demonstrates that many people no longer feel accountable for their own actions or situations. Footballers are just a microcosm of that.\nRojapy",

      "In the 2024/25 season, Liverpool had two dedicated number 9s (Nunez and Jota) with four other senior players capable of ‘doing a job’ to varying degrees (Chiesa, Diaz, Gakpo and Salah). In 2025/26 this became Isak and Ekitike, and Chiesa, Gakpo and Salah.",
      "There was literally zero prospect of a team trying to go through an entire season with just one recognised striker, so two were always going to be necessary. The fact that one of these unexpectedly turned out to be Isak may have pushed Ekitike from an expected starting role to backup, but doesn’t change the fundamental fact that he was always going to be competing with someone for his place. He was likely made aware of this when he signed.",
      "After a great start to his Liverpool career, getting himself sent off in some of the dumbest circumstances possible will have undoubtedly not helped him retain his starting position over Isak, but that has probably only accelerated the inevitable.",
      "However, with the number of games that Liverpool are likely to play and Isak’s lack of pre-season and slightly patchy injury record, Ekitike will still get plenty of starts and substitute appearances. It therefore seems unlikely that the times he spends on the bench will result in significant surprise or unhappiness on his part despite what the media and certain people BTL would have you believe.\nMatt D, London",

Ekitike was born in 2002, so for his entire football playing life, he’s known he’ll be booked if he does that.",
      "As Hesh points out, it’s a “nonsense” rule given how ultimately harmless the act is, and how unaffected the other team are by it.",
      "However, the act itself is equally as daft as the rule. Maybe it’s just me. I’ve never understood the logical connection between scoring and taking your shirt off. It’s probably the most prominent thing that doesn’t make sense outside of a football context, but even in a football context, it’s something people used to do and I’m not convinced many of them really knew why, beyond it being something lots of other people did at the time.\nEd Quoththeraven",

After the game, the coach of Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler, was very honest. He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",
      "“Baleba wanted to go to Man Utd. But he’s always been respectful with Brighton. He was keen on the move. Personal terms were never going to be an issue. The problem was only Brighton and Man Utd. Brighton might consider let him go in 2026 but in 2025 it was always a no. That situation effected the player.",

      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?",
      "It won’t have surprised Marcus Rashford that moving to another country has failed to extract him from the Manchester United orbit, nor perhaps how strong opinions toward him remain.",
      "But it would be interesting to hear his thoughts on Paul Scholes openly and happily explaining how “I really struggle to feel happy for him” after Rashford kickstarted his Barcelona career this past week.",
      "That is a remarkable admission, an insight which reveals far more uncomfortable truths about the personality of the pundit than it does the character of the player.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude, and his attitude at United by the time he was leaving,” Scholes continued, obviously on a podcast, obviously with Nicky Butt and Paddy McGuiness.",
      "“I thought he was a disgrace at United, and not trying, which look, if you fall out with the manager then okay. But remember, you’ve got teammates you’re playing with, you’ve got a massive 80,000 there, whatever it is every single week that you have to put a bit of effort in for.",
      "“The amount of times I saw him at Man United walking, because he wants to leave…I thought his whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.”",
      "The diatribe went on with shots at his work-rate against Newcastle – in a game he decided with two excellent goals – and culminated in a rant about Rashford being dropped for Barcelona’s next game after turning up late to a pre-match meeting.",
      "“What the f**k? How do you sleep in these days?” an increasingly incredulous Scholes asked, despite it long since having been reported that Rashford had been two minutes late because of a delay in filling out an electronic form, that he didn’t miss any of the pre-match preparations and indeed that he set up the third goal in a win over Valencia from the bench.",
      "A repeat of his past indiscretion under Erik ten Hag this was not.",
      "But that is the sort of fabrication one can only expect from a professional pundit who “really struggles to feel happy for” someone whose sacrifices and shortcomings he really should almost uniquely understand.",
      "Scholes has an important platform and authoritative voice, but also an obligation to use those properly in an arena as highly charged as that of Manchester United. If he cannot relate to and explain the pressures a professional footballer faces at the elite level and the misjudgements that can sometimes force them to make, that reflects abysmally on him rather than Rashford.",
      "The line about how Rashford “actually quit on Manchester United, and once you quit once, you’ll quit again” stood out too, as did the references to his age no longer being a defence of his actions.",
      "And at 27 that is absolutely fair. Rashford should know better than many of the decisions he made towards the ostensible end of his Manchester United career suggested.",
      "He might also justifiably point out he could have “quit on Manchester United” far sooner instead of playing through the pain of back, shoulder and foot injuries to be the most-used player by Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and second for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a 26-year-old Scholes would have been grateful not to face this constant level of withering censure and scrutiny when he made what has since been described as his biggest career regret.",
      "“I made a mistake,” Scholes has said of a moment his “head had just gone” in November 2001. “I did stupid things when I was a kid, when I was younger,” he added of refusing to play in a League Cup tie against Arsenal 24 hours after only getting 13 minutes from the bench in a defeat to Liverpool.",
      "Except he was no more “a kid” then than Rashford is now, no less responsible for his choices and actions. Scholes was fined two weeks’ wages, much as Rashford was during his infamous Belfast-based indiscretion at precisely the same age around 18 months ago.",
      "The difference is less in the players and far more in the club and its corroded culture. Manchester United in 2001 is the diametric opposite to Manchester United in 2025. The former was defined by the support network and sensational man-management of Sir Alex Ferguson; the latter protects nothing and no-one, exposing all it touches to toxicity and self-destruction.",
      "It is what Scholes and the rest of the “circle of Ferguson” so often overlook or take for granted. Their ludicrous talent aligned perfectly with the reign of a genius manager and elite structure which encouraged individual development and offered an environment in which players were protected. They speak from a position of immense ability and vast experience but also absurd fortune.",
      "Had this infernal brand of omnipresent Manchester United player-turned-pundit arrived a generation or two later, been saddled with hierarchical incompetence and intermittent coaching upheaval throughout their careers and had Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Bill Foulkes seeking out every microphone ever manufactured to actively undermine and denigrate them at any opportunity, they too might have found it tough and ultimately decided that leaving was in the best interests of all parties.",
      "Rashford did so in the knowledge that bridges had been burned on both sides, not just his. He won’t have expected a pat on the back and a pledge of lifelong support from the fans in doing so, but it also feels entirely ridiculous for one of his presumed heroes to brand him a “disgrace” who he “really struggles to feel happy for” 10 months after his last appearance for a broken club he tried to carry as far as he could.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch.",
      "Newcastle United beat Bradford City 4-1 and that really does prove a ‘masterstroke’ from Eddie Howe.",
      "Paul Scholes has received criticism for admitting he ‘struggles to feel happy’ for Marcus Rashford in Barcelona. But why should he?",
      "Eberechi Eze could be the genius Arsenal need but will he be allowed? He would probably get the chance at Liverpool.",

      "The 32-year-old will hit a century of goals for Bayern in only 104 games with a brace on Friday against Werder Bremen, which would make him the fastest player in Europe’s top-five leagues to reach that milestone.

      "Kane has been Bayern’s best and most consistent player since joining for around £100million, and they are reportedly in danger of losing him in the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, there is an ‘exit clause in his contract’ worth €65million (£56.8m), though he would have to ‘announce his move in the winter’.",
      "That fee for a 33-year-old represents ‘a lot of money’ but also ‘could be dangerous for Bayern’, the report states.",
      "However, that ‘doesn’t even buy half the price of Alexander Isak’ and even if Kane stays in Germany until he’s 36, ‘a model professional like him would still be tearing the Bundesliga to pieces’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Kane is said to still be keen to break the Premier League goalscoring record. It’s currently held by Alan Shearer with 260 goals. He himself has 213, all of which he’s scored for Tottenham. Should he return to his homeland in the summer after the 2026 World Cup, at the age of 33, he would have a prime chance of breaking the record.",

      "He Adventure Gamers: “I think Harry Kane has a clause that allows him to leave for a certain amount next summer. I believe the reason Bayern Munich wanted to bring Nick Woltemade in this summer was because many within the club think Kane wants to go back to England after the World Cup.",
      "“I can see Harry Kane at Manchester United next season, and I think he’d do well for them,” Hamann added.",
      "“Having said that, I always felt that as a London boy, sometimes they don’t really like to go to the north. Having played for Spurs, obviously Chelsea and Arsenal might be tricky, but then again, you never know, if they give him a chance to win the Premier League.",
      "“I always felt or thought that a London club would be more favourable than a northern club, but obviously United is probably still the biggest club in England, and if they were to ask for his services, I think it would be fantastic to see him as their number nine.”",

      "Manchester United will reportedly push to sign Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which is bad news for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side targeted Baleba towards the end of the summer transfer window but showed no desire to meet Brighton’s £100million asking price after making an enquiry.",
      "The head coach was still strongly backed in the summer, with Man Utd spending over £200m on new signings, most notably revamping their attack with the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After spending big, the Red Devils turned their attention to outgoings in the final weeks of the window.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho both left on deadline day, but one player who stayed put despite speculation was Mainoo.",
      "READ: Man Utd told to get Southgate ‘in to restructure the whole place’ at Amorim’s expense",
      "There was intense chatter over his future after he was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games, with clubs ranging from Real Madrid to Tottenham linked. But the hierarchy, led by INEOS’ Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had no desire to let the England midfielder leave on loan.",
      "Since then, Mainoo has had limited minutes: 45 off the bench against Burnley, 28 against Manchester City, three against Chelsea, and the full Carabao Cup second-round defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has previously boiled p*ss by saying Mainoo is competing for Bruno Fernandes’ position in the team, rather than competing with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to play next to the Man Utd captain.",
      "Fernandes is not getting dropped, especially in his current form, and with Ugarte failing to impress and Casemiro suspended after his red card against Chelsea, the clamour to see Mainoo start is growing even stronger.",
      "But spending a club-record fee on Baleba would all but nail Mainoo’s Old Trafford coffin shut. While Baleba’s arrival might excite fans, their academy graduate is the last player they want sacrificed to make it happen.",
      "From a boardroom perspective, Mainoo can be sold for pure profit, a godsend for the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which only makes his potential departure more appealing.",
      "The prospect of losing him has already angered supporters, and if Football Insider is right that Man Utd will try again for Baleba in January, then the club are effectively willing to shove Mainoo out, whether deliberately or as collateral damage.",
      "The report in question states:",
      "Sources say that Ruben Amorim’s side are likely to go back in for the 21-year-old in January, and that speculation will increase again in the new year.",
      "However, United would struggle to complete a deal during the mid-season window due to Brighton’s reluctance to sell, and would have a better chance of signing the youngster next summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at over £100m… Despite this, the speculation is playing into the Red Devils’ hands, with the Cameroon international suffering a poor start to the season amid claims that his head has been turned.",
      "Indeed, Baleba’s head might well have been turned by the struggling Red Devils, and Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler suggested as much after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "“Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he’s a very young player,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“It’s all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there’s interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying, ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "“It’s even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.”",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘closed a deal’ ahead of the winter transfer window, while Kobbie Mainoo is ‘ready to leave’.",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd are prepared to allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window on one condition, according to reports.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s former Man Utd team-mate Phil Jones insists that England international is likely to “force a move” away from Old Trafford in January.",
      "Man Utd have made a bid of €50m plus Kobbie Mainoo in an attempt to convince Real Madrid to part with Federico Valverde, according to reports."

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League, sharing his best bets and predictions.",
      "Football loves a storyline and sometimes spotting a potential one can lead to some profitable betting decisions. This fixture has it written all over it. I'm looking straight at the Bryan Mbeumo to score price and getting involved at 2/1 with Sky Bet. It's a selection where football's emotion meets football's logic. A case of the ex.",
      "Football fans have seen it before. A player goes back to his old stomping ground, a place where he was adored, nurtured and given the stage - and what happens? He scores. The emotion of the occasion can lift a player. Add in that little extra point to prove, and suddenly you've got the perfect recipe for a goalscorer bet.",
      "Also, Mbeumo knows Brentford inside-out. He knows the weaknesses, the defensive gaps, the way his opposition full-back will defend. And since joining United, Mbeumo has looked the part too - stretching defences, taking on full-backs, and looking dangerous between the lines. He's averaging a healthy 0.39 expected goals per 90 - a clear sign that chances are falling his way therefore his goal return should see an uptick soon enough.",
      "If you're the kind of punter like me who likes clean sheets, defensive discipline and backing under-goal lines - then this game isn't for you. This clash has got goals written all over it.",
      "Past meetings have at times descended into footballing mayhem. The last six meetings have averaged 4.3 goals per game and who can forget last season's fixture at Stamford Bridge where Brighton's offside trap was exposed brutally by Chelsea and shots were flying in from 30 yards in a 4-2 home win.",
      "Brighton remain the most reliable team in the Premier League for goals. Only one of their last 25 games across all competitions has seen less than two goals scored with the per game total goals average at a fiery 3.64 per game. Expect entertainment and the over 3.5 goal line to give you a great run at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "The lazy narrative will tell you that Liverpool have the title wrapped up already. Results say they're flying - unbeaten in five, late winners. But peel back the scoreboard and ask yourself, are this team that convincing?",
      "For me? No.",
      "This team are getting the job done, yes, but there's a lack of control in games that is leading to fine margins deciding the outcomes. That should ring a few alarm bells. Bournemouth caused them problems. Newcastle ran all over them. Burnley almost stifled them. Everton nearly nabbed them.",
      "Palace can punish them. Oliver Glasner has built a no-nonsense team that are almost perfect in terms of organisation without possession. Since they got beat 5-0 at Newcastle they are unbeaten in 17 competitive games, and they've won two trophies in that time. Across those 17 games they have just conceded nine goals and bagged nine clean sheets. That pure structural discipline can lead them to a result here on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "I think this game sets up very well for a Leeds win here at 2/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a fantastic team to bet on as their style never changes and clear, trustworthy patterns are emerging in that when teams allow them the ball, they struggle.",
      "In their last 14 matches where they've averaged 56 per cent or more possession, their record is W4 D3 L7. In that sample size they have been beaten by Brentford twice, Leicester and Ipswich. If Bournemouth can't force you into transitions, they become awkwardly one-paced and predictable in the final third.",
      "And this is how Leeds have been trying to play this season. They are full of physicality and built to play very direct and aggressive football with also being very secure at the back where the excellent Ethan Ampadu leads their defensive organisation.",
      "This will be a game where punters will be twitching their fingers instinctively towards the overs with visions of City with Erling Haaland in the form of his life carving through a low block like a hot knife through butter. But if you scratch beneath the surface, there's a compelling case for going the other way. The under 2.5 goals angle looks best bet of the weekend material at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola just might be building a team that dominates through defensive output - and the rock-solid axis of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol is absolutely pivotal to that. They've started 11 games together domestically since the start of April and City won eight of those games with the only defeat being the FA Cup final. Across those 11 games they only conceded five goals, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "And now if you add Gianluigi Donnarumma and Rodri into that defensive unit, you've got yourself a really domineering and formidable defensive axis, one that could be the backbone of a team that challenges for major honours once again.",
      "Also, of the 50 Premier League games played this season, 25 have fallen under the 2.5 goals line and the overall goals per game average sits at 2.48. That will eventually rise but it's just another bit of evidence to throw in the mix for an unders bet.",
      "Hello, old friend. Nice to see you again. Ange-ball was back and dancing to the tune of some very happy Forest fans in the away end at Real Betis.",
      "Yes, Forest didn't get maximum points but boy were they pulsating for most of that game. Ange Postecoglou has flicked the tactical switch as the new boss and has painted his footballing identity all over these Forest players already which is based around: attack first, ask questions later.",
      "You could see the blueprint Postecoglou built at Celtic and Spurs - overloads in wide areas, full-backs tucking in to build and midfielders darting between lines, something Elliot Anderson absolutely thrived at.",
      "It was fun to watch. And we can declare with confidence that they're going to create chances. Lots of them. And concede lots of chances too.",
      "This new Forest style is going to blow the lid off their goal lines. Forget the side that grinded out 1-0s at home - this is now a team actively embracing risk and one who will become an over 2.5 money-spinner while the prices remain behind the curve. It's Evens here and where Postecoglou is involved, over 2.5 lines simply must be your punting friend.",
      "Vitor Pereira needs to change something. Dating back to last season, Wolves have no win in nine games, taking just one point from the last 27 available. However, he might just have stumbled upon the system that could lead to a change in fortunes. The 4-4-2 he played in the midweek win over Everton made Wolves more compact and - crucially - seemed to help get support into their key striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "This Wolves side might still be winless but playing Spurs, weirdly, brings out their best. They have amassed nine Premier League wins vs Spurs, the club's joint-most against any opponent and have won four of the last five meetings.",
      "Maybe, the old-school 4-4-2 could be the key to spark Wolves into life against their favourite opponent? They could be worth a swing at 4/1 on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Sander Berge to be carded at 3/1 with Sky Bet is simply too big for a player who's being thrust into the midfield furnace against one of the most skilled card-drawing teams in the Premier League.",
      "Aston Villa's engine room of Morgan Rogers and John McGinn - with the occasional Ollie Watkins thrown in from further forward - isn't just technically sharp, it's a card magnet's dream. They rotate positions, carry the ball with purpose and are constantly engaging the opposition.",
      "In Villa's last 14 Premier League games an opposition centre-midfielder has been carded in 12 of those matches with 16 carded in total. Fulham have history of cards in this fixture too, having been shown 20 yellows in the past five meetings, with Berge one of those players cautioned last time.",
      "This is the last fixture Mikel Arteta needs right now.",
      "A trip that's rapidly becoming one of the most emotionally charged and physically demanding fixtures in the Premier League calendar and one where Arsenal have history of succumbing to the atmosphere.",
      "Arsenal are favourites with the markets here at Evens with Sky Bet. But should they be? I'm not having it. Not when Newcastle are in this kind of mood at home as the underdog.",
      "There's something about Newcastle that rattles Arteta's Arsenal. The Gunners have lost four of their last five games in all competitions at St James' Park, including both visits last season. They have failed to score in all four defeats.",
      "Arteta teams love rhythm and structure and the Newcastle midfield don't give you that. They break your passing lanes, slow down your build-up and make it a scrap. They don't just play the occasion, they use it as a weapon. And in front of the Geordie faithful, Newcastle look a savvy bet on the draw no bet market at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Since swapping the somewhat clockwork football of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City for the freedom given to him at Everton, Jack Grealish looks like Jack Grealish again.",
      "His take-ons per 90 has rocketed from 3.7 per game at City from the past two seasons to 9.1 per 90 in the Everton blue. Grealish's time at City wasn't wasted of course, he won trophies, created history and matured. But he wasn't the maverick that made him box office.",
      "Well, the maverick inside is being unleashed by David Moyes and Grealish is the most creative player in the Premier League as a result. Grealish has four assists, creating 2.9 chances per 90 from open play - no player to have played 200 minutes or more has a higher per-90 figure from that metric. He is 11/4 with Sky Bet to bag another assist in what should be a routine home win.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",

      "United raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro following a red card for Robert Sanchez, but the result was thrown into question when the Brazil midfielder picked up his second yellow of the evening.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back for Chelsea with 10 minutes to go but Amorim's side held on - thanks to a defensive performance that Luke Shaw described as \"desperate\" after the game - to secure a much-needed win.",
      "United headed into the fixture with just four points from as many games, their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, but pressure will now be momentarily alleviated on Amorim and his squad after what was described by Redknapp as their \"biggest win\" since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "\"This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "United broke into the top half as a result of their win against Chelsea, with games against Brentford and Sunderland now on the horizon before the October international break.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim remained level-headed regarding his team's performance and called for them to create momentum moving forward.",
      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "Pressure had been ramped up on Amorim and his side in the build-up to the visit of Chelsea, which arrived as the following fixture to a dismal 3-0 defeat to local rivals Manchester City.",
      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 13:08, UK",
      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he hopes to get the time to show how his system will evolve, but insists not even the Pope will make him change it right now for fear of what the players will think of him.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" he said. \"Not once [have I thought about changing]. Not even the Pope [can make me], it will not change.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained he will stick with his 3-4-2-1 formation despite having the worst win percentage of any United boss since the Second World War and overseeing their worst start in the Premier League for 33 years.",
      "United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference - since Amorim was appointed last November.",
      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",
      "\"If I'm a player and I have a coach with a lot of pressure to change the system and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"When you think about the impact of any decision on the team, everything is important.",
      "\"This will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way. It will change, I hope to have the time to change.\"",
      "One of the issues with Amorim's system has been in midfield where Bruno Fernandes has played in a deeper role. Amorim believes he is still having an impact higher up the pitch and is integral in making them dominate games.",
      "\"Bruno wants all the freedom in the world but even when he played a No 10 role, it's getting the ball back,\" he said. \"Maybe he's not having the same freedom to get inside the box but he's getting there and is near the box and can have shots.",
      "\"I want Bruno to be more deep to have more possession to try and control more of the game. We are doing that. Sometimes we miss Bruno a little bit in front, maybe because (Matheus) Cunha is not there. I'm trying to balance the team and imagine the game.",
      "\"I see Bruno [doing] well. He's frustrated because he's not winning games. Sometimes he likes to go further but he has a job to do. The important thing is not Bruno playing well, it's the team playing well and winning football games.\"",
      "Amorim believes the data is showing improvement although believes they lack belief compared to Liverpool, who have been winning games late on.",
      "He said: \"It's belief, confidence, aggression. It's everything. Sometimes what we call luck. It's the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"Liverpool are winning all the games in the 90th minute, it's something about the teams that are winning to have that feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well but something is going to go wrong.",
      "\"We need to change that but just with wins. If you look at the goals against Man City, Fulham, we scored against Burnley, we are good in the game but then we draw. All these moments I think we can do better. It's our fault.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho returns to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40m move to Chelsea after being told he could leave at the end of last season and was not training with Amorim's first-team squad during pre-season.",
      "Asked if the transfer could backfire on Man Utd, Amorim said: \"I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who is playing for the opponent, [or] what people are going to say in the end if the player plays well. They are good players and they play well if things happen. My only focus is winning the game.\"",
