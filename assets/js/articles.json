      "Bruno Fernandes has clarified his future(Image: YouTube/Rio Ferdinand Presents/Manchester United)",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is NOT looking to leave the club in the January transfer window. It has been suggested that the Portuguese midfielder is keen on moving away following Ruben Amorim’s sacking.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon coach was axed earlier this month following a dismal 14-month spell at Old Trafford. Fernandes, 31, was seen meeting with one his former boss’s coaches Carlos Fernandes in the aftermath of Amorim's exit, leading to speculation that he could be angling for his own move away.",
      "But according to BBC Sport, he remains committed to the club and he will stick to his original plan of evaluating his future at the end of his season when he will have just one year remaining on his contract.",
      "Fresh talk over Fernandes’ future comes amid constant suggestions that he could leave the club. The playmaker has been linked with Spanish giants Real Madrid in the past, as well as Saudi side Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes snubbed a move to the Middle East last summer but has since admitted that he felt the club were trying to force him out. He said: \"From the club I felt it was, 'If you go it's not so bad for us'.",
      "\"It hurts me a bit. More than hurting me, it makes me sad. I'm a player that no one can criticise, I'm always available, I always give my best. I could have left in this transfer window, I would have earned much more money.",
      "\"I would have won many trophies this season, but I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"The club wanted me to leave. I told the directors that, I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision because the manager wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even with the manager wanting me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes will not look to leave Man United in the aftermath of Amorim's departure(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Fernandes has made 310 appearances for United since joining from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, scoring 103 goals. He is now set to play for his eighth manager at Old Trafford.",
      "Michael Carrick has been confirmed as the club’s manager until the end of the season, having taken the reins from former teammate Darren Fletcher. He will aim to have a positive start to his second reign in charge as United take on rivals Manchester City on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's defender, Lisandro Martinez, has confessed that he contemplated hanging up his boots and retiring from football after a dreadful ACL injury last year. The 27-year-old was sidelined for nine months following the injury he sustained in a 2-0 loss against Crystal Palace in February.",
      "After undergoing surgery, he missed the end of the previous season and the start of the current one, before making a comeback in the 2-1 victory over Oliver Glasner's team at the end of November. Since his £55million transfer from Ajax to Old Trafford in July 2022, the former Ajax player has had a string of injuries.",
      "Reportedly, the defender was involved in a training ground spat with Ruben Amorim over the Christmas period, just before the Portuguese head coach left Old Trafford. It's alleged that Martinez was pushing for more playing time after being out for the last nine months, asserting that he was ready to contribute to the team.",
      "Now, in a candid interview with AFA Estudio, the United defender admits he considered ending his career.",
      "\"You feel like you're not a football player anymore,\" Martinez confessed. \"You feel pain and think you'll never play football again.",
      "\"A mental and physical imbalance, which, honestly, when I think about it today, I don't know how I did it. I clung to the people around me, my family, my friends.",
      "\"After the first two or three weeks, to be honest, I didn't want to play football anymore. And then, of course, you become more aware, you get that support.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez reportedly had an explosive row with Ruben Amorim(Image: )",
      "Martinez also suffered a fractured metatarsal in April 2023, ruling him out for the rest of that season. He required a second operation on the injury, sidelining him for 180 days across two separate periods.",
      "The injury meant he missed the FA Cup final loss to Man City that campaign, and he was also absent for last year's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Discussing his rehabilitation, Martinez said: \"You need to not take the easy way out. The easy way out is to just give up and that's it.",
      "\"But, I always say, it's in the face of adversity that you show your true character. So I reconnected with myself, I reconnected with my roots, with who I am, with my values, and I gave it my all, day after day.",
      "\"For me, it was day by day, a constant struggle, and my match was every day at the gym. Then, well, I had therapy with my psychologist, always trying to improve in every aspect - and then I was clear about what I wanted, right?\".",
      "\"To try to become the best version of myself, to give my best, to see how far I could go.",
      "\"And the truth is that with each passing month, I saw the results, I saw how I was getting stronger, and today, on the pitch, I feel excellent, and I say that thanks to those days, well, of suffering, of not giving up - today we have the results.\"",

      "Results had been poor under Amorim, while his relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox soured to the point of no return. One comment in particular from the former Southampton man irked Amorim as he compared his role to that of the manager.",
      "Things were seemingly so bad at Old Trafford that he was willing to forgo any sort of compensation and quit outright, according to reports. As per The Sun, Amorim was ready to quit three days before he was actually sacked following a row with Wilcox.",
      "A discussion with his agent Raul Costa saw him change his mind. Amorim’s representative believed that his client should have either been backed or sacked - and if his spell was indeed coming to an end that he should be compensated for his work.",
      "Amorim was of course on the way out of the club shortly after that having been dismissed by Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada following the draw with Leeds, which say him secure a £12m payoff.",
      "His exit came just days after a bizarre rant about his role at the club. He said: \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",

No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",

      "Tyrell Malacia will hold talks over his Manchester United future(Image: Getty)",
      "Tyrell Malacia is set to discuss his immediate future with Manchester United's interim head coach Michael Carrick. The 26-year-old was part of the club's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, but those four all managed to secure moves away from Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "Garnacho made a permanent switch to Chelsea, Antony returned to Real Betis, Rashford joined Barcelona on a season-long loan, and Sancho temporarily moved to Aston Villa. A last-minute move to Elche for Malacia fell through on deadline day.",
      "Despite being sidelined and spending the subsequent two months out of the team, the Dutchman made a comeback as an unused substitute in the 4-2 victory over Brighton in October. He was included in the next six squads and even made a brief appearance in the final two minutes against Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Injuries to other players have seen him feature for the Under-21s, where he scored during a 45-minute stint against Wolves earlier this week. The Sun claims Malacia is seeking clarity from Carrick before making any final decisions about his future.",
      "As he enters the final stretch of his contract at Old Trafford, a departure in the winter transfer window hasn't been ruled out. It's been suggested that there are clubs interested in Malacia, but none of the current options seem to appeal to him.",
      "United aren't expected to approve any first-team transfers this month, but the imminent return of three key players will provide a welcome boost akin to fresh acquisitions. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad have already resumed training at Carrington following the elimination of Cameroon and the Ivory Coast from AFCON.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui made the final of the tournament with Morocco and is expected back in England next week. Harry Maguire joined Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo amongst the recent injury returnees last weekend after a two-month spell on the sidelines, although Matthijs de Ligt remains unavailable.",
      "Carrick will undoubtedly be encouraged that the Dutch defender is the only senior United player currently sidelined, but he confronts a considerable challenge following a difficult few years. Nevertheless, the club's former midfielder, who spent three years managing Middlesbrough, is relishing the opportunity ahead alongside several other former United legends.",
      "Michael Carrick took charge of his first training session at Carrington on Wednesday(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "He said: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour. I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",

      "The former player has arrived to take charge until the end of the season and will inherit a team that has won just once in their last seven games and has just been dumped out of the FA Cup by Brighton - ending any hopes they had of winning a trophy this season.",
      "Despite their run of results Sir Alex Ferguson's former assistant Rene Meulensteen believes the issues facing them are easily fixable and has backed Carrick to make the necessary changes, but insists that their defence is far too brittle at present.",
      "Even 19th-placed Burnley scored twice against them last week as they claimed a point at Turf Moor. Prior to that, Bournemouth came to Old Trafford and scored four times in an eight-goal thriller. United are currently in a run of one clean sheet across their last 15 games.",
      "Meulensteen said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast: \"What I saw in both of the games [under Darren Fletcher], there’s gaps all over the place and opposition will exploit that. He has to come in, especially in the games against City and Arsenal coming up, and make sure that’s sorted.",
      "\"I trust him in his football ability and intelligence to get that right. I don’t think it’s too difficult to fix, in my opinion. If all the players are available I wouldn’t know exactly what my best line-up would be because you would have to work with players and see what the best connections are at the back, we talked about the goalkeeper issue, in the midfield there’s issues there, but front wise, there’s plenty of power in terms of creating and scoring goals.\"",
      "United's defence had not been aided by the 3-4-3 formation employed by Ruben Amorim, which never properly clicked in Manchester. It was often cited how they were continually outnumbered in midfield, which also offered little by way of protection.",
      "Under Darren Fletcher the team conceded four times in two games(Image: )",

      "And while his main task will be guiding the Red Devils to the best possible Premier League finish come May, Carrick could also be tasked with incomings and outgoings this month. While Amorim had noted how there were no plans to make changes to his squad before his dismissal, Carrick's view could contrast.",
      "United have been linked with LDU Quito's Ederson Castillo, as they look to plan for the future of an ageing engine room. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have been the club's first-choice pairing in the centre of the park this season, seeing success in part.",
      "However, with Fernandes arguably more suited to an attacking role, and Casemiro's future with the club beyond 2025/26 unknown, the Red Devils could look to bring in suitable additions. Castillo is one name who has cropped up as of recent, with the 17-year-old wonderkid - who has been dubbed the 'new Moises Caicedo' - linked with a £4million move to the north west.",
      "United aren't the only European powerhouse monitoring the Ecuadorian's situation at present, however. Reports suggest that Barcelona have offered Castillo a trial with the club at youth level, with the club potentially snapping him up permanently should he impress.",
      "Ederson Castillo has been likened to Moises Caicedo(Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "As a result, United may need to work quickly to secure an agreement for the midfielder.",
      "It is understood that Kobbie Mainoo is currently aggrieved at a lack of playing time with Manchester United, as Napoli lead the race to secure the 20-year-old on loan. The midfielder started just one match for his current club under Amorim this season, in the form of an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town via penalties.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has seen limited gametime at Manchester United(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "While Darren Fletcher gave Mainoo a chance to flourish during United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton at the weekend, it remains to be seen what Carrick's plans for the youngster are. However, the interim head coach would be wise to link up with Mainoo in the near future, as the January window heats up.",
      "It is understood that Mainoo will look for options elsewhere if his gametime continues to be hampered at Old Trafford. And with just a matter of weeks separating the present and a February 2 deadline, Carrick may have to prioritise the star's progression, either with or without United.",
      "BILD recently claimed that Manchester United have been in informal contact with Karim Adeyemi, as the forward's future with Borussia Dortmund is cast into speculation. However, new reports from Teamtalk suggest that the 23-year-old is not a top priority and is viewed as more of a short-term option.",

      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United,\" Giggs told BetSelect.",

      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating.",

However, groundwork will be laid, fans will hope, to ensure the club is in the best possible position to strengthen in the summer window.",
      "Champions League qualification would help on that front and despite a chaotic campaign so far, a top four or five finish isn't out of the question. Here's a round-up of the latest United transfer news…",
      "It's not just potential signings United will be thinking about but departures too. It will be necessary to move on some under-performing players to make room for quality additions.",
      "However, United will be desperate to keep one of their few reliable performers, Bruno Fernandes, happy amid suggestions the captain is growing restless as the club lurches from one crisis to another.",
      "The Portuguese star had the chance to move to the Saudi Pro League last summer but decided to stay put, declaring that he still wanted to \"play at the highest level and compete for major titles.\" However, with United out of both cup competitions and the title race, Fernandes is likely to be getting itchy feet again.",
      "The i Paper reports that there is \"general fear\" around the club that Fernandes may \"had enough\" and will look to move this summer. Having had a close relationship with Amorim, his countryman's sacking may have pushed the 31-year-old closer to the exit door himself.",
      "Fernandes has 18 months left on his United deal with the option of a further 12 months, meaning this summer could be crunch time for his future at the club. Bayern Munich are reportedly among the clubs monitoring the situation.",
      "Fernandes's patience may be running out(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Given United's struggles, enticing a quality midfielder to the club may be easier said than done this summer. However, one middleman has made it clear he would relish a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Frank Onyeka, who has played a part in Brentford's excellent season under Keith Andrews, had openly admitted he would welcome a move to Old Trafford. It should be noted that he was put on the spot by a fan during the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Brentford's Frank Onyeka is clearly fond of United(Image: PA)",
      "When asked if he would like to play for United, Onyeka cheerily answered: \"Of course I want to play for Manchester United!\"",
      "A move to Old Trafford looks unlikely, given he has made just nine appearances for the Bees this season. For now, Onyeka is focused on AFCON glory in Morocco after helping Nigeria to the semi-finals, where they will face the host nation.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's former right-hand man Rene Meulensteen has offered to share his expertise with Michael Carrick during his stint as Manchester United's interim boss. The 44-year-old Carrick was handed the reins this week, stepping in just over a week after Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "With United sitting as close to 12th as they are fourth place, there's precious little room for mistakes. Meulensteen, who served as Ferguson's assistant from 2008 to 2013, has made it clear he's ready to offer Carrick support over the phone should he require it over the next few months.",
      "Speaking to Casinostugan, the ex-Fulham boss said: \"It's 12 and a half years since I left United. So many managers have come and gone and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] has been there, and there's never been any talks, so I don't really think about it.",
      "\"Those 12 and a half years are a long time. So many things have changed. What we had under Sir Alex was unique. You had the most successful manager in the history of English football and everything was done a certain way and we played with a style and all that is gone now.",
      "\"Everything is different. The players are different. The environment is different. There are different roles.",
      "\"You have no idea what kind of impact you could have. Obviously, if Michael Carrick or someone else rang me, I'd pick up the phone. Of course you would, wouldn't you!\"",
      "Meulensteen knows Carrick well. (Image: 2013 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick takes charge of a United side languishing in seventh place in the Premier League standings, three points adrift of the Champions League spots. The former midfielder faces a daunting baptism of fire in his second caretaker spell, kicking off with a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, followed by a trip to table-toppers Arsenal.",
      "When questioned about what the ex-England star needs to prioritise, Meulensteen stressed that Carrick must swiftly establish his tactical approach. The Dutchman added: \"There's a lot of different players at United at this moment of time so you have to sort of rebuild a few things again.",
      "\"Amorim was trying to mould them into a system that never really worked. That's a challenge for Michael now to set them up in a system that suits the players.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June. (Image: 2025 Allstar)",
      "\"Everybody knows he has taken the job as the interim manager all the way up to the summer. So we will have to wait and see before we look beyond what Manchester United are going to do then.",
      "\"Can Carrick do enough to remain as the permanent manager like Solskjaer did when he was brought in as caretaker? It could happen because let's assume he goes on an unbelievable, unbeaten run and secures top-four, gets Champions League football, and they've got nothing else to worry about.",
      "\"At this moment in time, all they need to do is make sure that they win as many games in the Premier League as they possibly can, but I think what people will also look at is the way they are going to play under Michael. And his style of play.\"",

      "Manchester United's squad problems are beginning to resolve themselves, and at the perfect moment too, as Michael Carrick prepares for his first match as interim manager in Saturday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.",
      "United have found it difficult to gain the upper hand against local rivals Manchester City in recent years, managing just one victory in their last five encounters on home turf. This latest instalment of the historic rivalry comes as the Red Devils have recently implemented sweeping changes to their coaching setup.",
      "Previous boss Ruben Amorim was sacked earlier this month. On Tuesday - just four days ahead of Pep Guardiola's team's arrival - an agreement was reached for former United midfielder Carrick to return as interim manager for the rest of the 2025/26 season.",
      "European qualification is still within reach for United this season, and Carrick is keen to get off to the best possible start at Old Trafford - with a baptism of fire against Manchester City this weekend. That's why the sight of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back at Carrington was such a boost.",
      "Both players have been absent since mid-December, having been called up to represent their respective countries in this year's Africa Cup of Nations. Amad was part of the reigning champions Ivory Coast team, while Mbeumo played for Cameroon.",
      "Unfortunately, both experienced defeat in the quarter-finals last weekend. Ivory Coast were knocked out by Egypt, while Cameroon lost to tournament hosts Morocco, who boast fellow United star Noussair Mazraoui in their ranks.",
      "Despite the personal disappointment, this means they can now focus on their club campaign for 2025/26, returning to a very different United than the one they left last month. With Carrick at the helm, both returning players could find themselves competing for a starting spot.",
      "Amad and Bryan Mbeumo were back for Michael Carrick's first training session as Man Utd boss(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The interim coach is planning to deviate from Amorim's favoured 3-4-3 formation, opting instead for a back-four. Carrick typically set his team up in a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time in charge of Championship outfit Middlesbrough.",
      "The previous arrangement allowed both players to start, with Mbeumo in the attack and Amad overlapping but tasked with more defensive duties. Before their departure for AFCON, the former netted seven goals and provided one assist in 17 appearances for United, while the latter contributed two goals and two assists.",
      "However, it was Amad who shone brighter at AFCON. In his own attacking role, the 23-year-old scored three times and assisted once in five games, compared to Mbeumo's single assist in the same number of appearances.",
      "So, Carrick has a crucial choice to make regarding who will start on the right wing when United face City this weekend.",
      "Michael Carrick will take charge of United against Man City this weekend(Image: Getty)",

      "Simon Jordan thinks there is a specific reason Manchester United didn't hire Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: talkSPORT)",
      "Simon Jordan believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was overlooked for the Manchester United job because appointing him would have been based on sentiment rather than merit. The Norwegian managed the Red Devils for nearly three years between 2018 and 2021.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's exit, United have finally appointed a new head coach to see out the remainder of the season. Darren Fletcher had been at the helm for two fixtures, a 2-2 draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton, but Michael Carrick has now taken charge.",
      "Carrick previously managed United on a caretaker basis when Solskjaer was dismissed in November 2021. During his brief spell, he secured two victories from three matches and drew the other.",
      "For some time, the Norwegian appeared to be the frontrunner to replace Amorim on an interim basis, but Carrick was ultimately given the role. Former Crystal Palace chairman Jordan suggests Solskjaer was passed over because his appointment wouldn't have been seen as forward-thinking, with popularity alone insufficient grounds for his return.",
      "\"Carrick did a good job at Middlesbrough. But it's interesting, when I was speaking to most people last week, there were various people finding out whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in the frame,\" Jordan said on talkSPORT.",
      "\"Mike Phelan hadn't been contacted. And there is this thought process that Phelan and Solskjaer travel together, as we've seen previously.",
      "\"So, whether they have reacted to the public backlash or the perception of people criticising the fact that this appointment hadn't worked previously, and you'd be going back without any innovation.",
      "Solskjaer spent almost three years in charge of United(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Or whether Carrick... Because I heard that Carrick wants to be a coach, wants to be a No. 2, doesn't want to be a frontman. But he clearly did a decent job at Middlesbrough. Clearly he's a sensible head.",
      "\"It looks different, and that's I think one of the criticisms about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Not against Ole, I have my own views on whether he's a good manager or not.",
      "\"But because it didn't look particularly, in any shape or form, like there was any thinking behind it. 'Oh, okay, that looks like a popular fit and everyone likes him. He's unchallenging in people's minds.'",
      "\"That might well be the challenge that Man United have to do now, which is keep on playing to an optic rather than getting an outcome. We'll see. As I say, Carrick has done a decent job at Middlesbrough, but Man United is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Carrick has been appointed until the end of the season(Image: Getty)",
      "Upon his appointment as head coach, Carrick expressed confidence in his ability to bring out the best in his United players. He said: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour.",

      "Michael Carrick scored highly in three areas that Manchester United bosses were looking at with his knowledge of the current players helping him land the head coach role until the end of the season.",
      "The former midfielder was up against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy as the club sought someone to take charge of the team for the coming months following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. Carrick, an assistant at Old Trafford previously, impressed Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada in person.",
      "During their discussions it became clear that Carrick had good intel and detail about the squad members. That no doubt owing to his spell at the club where he worked with a number of them, including Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot.",
      "His ability to lead a team was also cited as a major plus, reports the Daily Mail. Carrick had spent almost three years in charge of Middlesbrough and thus taking the major role isn't new to him, even if it will now be on a far greater scale in Manchester.",
      "Finally Carrick's willingness to work collaboratively was something that attracted the United hierarchy. It is well documented that Amorim wanted more influence at Old Trafford, taking issue with his head coach title as he sought more of a managerial role - which ultimately cost him. Carrick has already been informed that he will need to work with what he's got in Manchester.",
      "Despite being on the shortlist Van Nistelrooy, unlike Solskjer and Carrick, didn't get to meet the club's bosses face-to-face. He had an caretaker spell after Erik ten Hag was sacked last season and is known by the hierarchy, thus they didn't feel the need to meet him again.",
      "The two senior executives did sit down with Sir Alex Ferguson for coffee at Carrington last Tuesday, just 24 hours after Amorim was given his marching orders, and sought his advice about what should come next. Ferguson is said to have endorsed Carrick, a player he signed from Tottenham.",
      "Michael Carrick got the nod ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: PA)",
      "Additional discussions with Carrick involved who would work underneath him. The new head coach is close to Jonny Evans, another former player who will now work with in the coaching staff. He also wanted Jonathan Woodgate, his former assistant at Middlesbrough, with the duo having a close bond and a good working relationship. They drove to training together on Wednesday.",
      "None of them had worked with Steve Holland, the ex-England assistant in the past, but it was felt that the former Chelsea coach had a skillset and the experience that would be beneficial in the new set-up.",

      "Michael Carrick is the new Manchester United manager until the end of the season(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Rio Ferdinand says Michael Carrick’s first objective at Manchester United should be to restore the confidence of his players. Carrick was announced as the club’s new interim manager on Tuesday, taking over after Ruben Amorim’s sacking last week.",
      "The former Red Devils midfielder, who had a brief unbeaten stint in charge as caretaker manager in 2021, will lead the side until the end of the season, following his own dismissal at Middlesbrough seven months ago.",
      "United have been woeful defensively, only conceding fewer goals than the bottom six, which has resulted in inconsistent results. Perhaps most importantly, the players by the end of Amorim’s 14-month reign were visibly playing within themselves, something club legend Ferdinand believes Carrick should address right away.",
      "The ex-defender is of the view that Carrick should try to foster confidence by getting results, potentially playing a defensive and less expansive style initially.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I think he’s got to instil confidence back into this team. I think it doesn’t matter what players you’ve got or how good they are, they’ll never give the best version of themselves if they’re lacking confidence.",
      "“To do that, there’s things he’s going to have to do behind the scenes to bring them together and to make them start believing in themselves through training and creating patterns. But then it’s down to results.",
      "“They’ve got to find a way of getting results. If that, for the moment, is playing a different style of football that suits this group, perhaps more counter-attacking to build confidence… Then you can start moulding the team in time into a new shape and the way you want it to be.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand says Carrick must restore the players' confidence(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents)",
      "He added: “Without the confidence right now it will be really difficult, almost impossible, to build any momentum with this team and get us into a respectable position at the end of the season.”",
      "Carrick, a five-time Premier League and one-time Champions League winner with United, will be well aware of what a confident and positive dressing room looks like, having learned first hand from the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Carrick will now prepare the team for two daunting tasks, beginning with the visit of Manchester City at the weekend. He is expected to deviate from the controversial 3-4-3 formation implemented by Amorim, both in that game and against league leaders Arsenal the following weekend.",

      "Ex-United midfielder Michael Carrick has been appointed as the interim head coach until the season's end, with his primary objective being to secure Champions League football for the club. Carrick, who previously managed Middlesbrough, won over the United board during discussions and will be supported by Steve Holland and Travis Binnion at M16.",
      "Carrick's first test will be this Saturday's lunchtime Premier League clash against Manchester City (12.30pm). Despite his appointment, speculation continues to swirl about who will be named as United's next permanent boss.",

      "He said: \"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he's done it, he's seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like. I don't think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else.",
      "\"Ancelotti would say this is what I'm doing. I'm managing what I'm here to do.",
      "\"They obviously weren't aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than people in the background.\"",
      "Ex-Reds skipper Gary Neville has recently concurred with Meulensteen that Ancelotti is a prime candidate to take over the reins at United.",
      "\"With these last 12 years being a period of massive underperformance for Manchester United managers, there are certain boxes the next candidate now needs to tick,\" Neville penned in the Overlap newsletter.",
      "Gary Neville wants Carlo Ancelotti at Manchester United(Image: Emilee Chinn - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)",
      "\"1. You have to be able to handle the media and the noise which comes with this club. It is what it is, so get over it and deal with it. It's why you're getting paid the big bucks.",
      "\"2. You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football, and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "\"3. You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it's different to competing in many of the European leagues.",
      "\"4. You also have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1 / 4-2-3-1.",
      "\"You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and, as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final.",
      "\"No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically, the club met with Carlo shortly before his [Sir Alex Ferguson's] retirement in 2013 and we could have short-circuited this entire process, starting with him at the beginning of the cycle.",

      "The new man at the helm will be expected to work with the squad he has inherited in Manchester, reports ESPN, with the club having no desire to dip into the market this month.",

      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba are all on their radar but neither of them will be sold by their clubs in January.",
      "It is also understood that any sale are unlikely with Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a return to Italy, staying put. There was a lot of noise around Kobbie Mainoo in recent months given his lack of game time, but he too is expected to remain at Old Trafford.",

      "Michael Carrick has made his thoughts clear on Kobbie Mainoo already(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Newly appointed Manchester United manager Michael Carrick agrees with Sir Alex Ferguson that Kobbie Mainoo is the lifeblood of the club. Carrick, a former United midfielder, was confirmed as interim head coach on Tuesday until the end of the season.",
      "The 44-year-old steps into the dugout following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim last week, having previously held the reins at United for three games in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "It remains to be seen what United under Carrick will look like and how he will set the team up. However, his past interviews suggest out-of-favour youngster Mainoo could return to the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo enjoyed a meteoric rise at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag, having graduated from the academy. He most notably played a pivotal role in their 2024 FA Cup triumph over Manchester City before becoming a fully-fledged England international.",
      "Yet, the Stockport-born midfielder found himself sidelined under Amorim, despite the latter's limited midfield options. The 20-year-old was reportedly considering leaving United but may now find a reprieve under Carrick, particularly given the manager's previous comments.",
      "In a conversation with fellow club legend Rio Ferdinand last year, Carrick was asked if he would build the midfield around Mainoo. Carrick responded: \"Yeah, I think for a club to have a player that’s come through the academy and knows the club and feels it… I think Man United’s got to have an element of that. It always has done and always should have.",
      "\"To have a talent like Mainoo, which he’s shown already, you’ve got to have players like that [in the team], players that you can say, ‘They get it. They know it. Let’s help them and stick with them’. I think there’s definitely a place for him there, for sure.\"",
      "His comments followed reports suggesting Mainoo had been exploring a summer move to Napoli, only for Amorim to block the transfer. Carrick's views echo those of legendary United manager Ferguson, who famously built his success around academy products like the Class of '92.",
      "The Scottish icon emphasised that homegrown talent was vital to United's DNA when asked about Mainoo and the now departed Alejandro Garnacho in 2024.",
      "Mainoo may get a second chance under Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Alex told TikToker Jamal Niaz: \"It’s the foundation, isn’t it? It’s the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They’re young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have. It’s a distinction in human beings, some have the will to be that [fearless at a young age].\"",
      "How Carrick plans to deploy Mainoo is yet to be seen, especially considering his previous comments to Ferdinand where he identified the youngster as an attacking midfielder. Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",

Greenwood played the full 90 minutes of Tuesday's Coupe de France match, where Ligue 1 giants Marseille showed no mercy against sixth-tier side Bayeux, securing a 9-0 victory at the Stade Michel d'Ornano in Caen.",
      "Bayeux's decision to avoid a defensive set-up backfired spectacularly, bringing their impressive run in the tournament to an end. Roberto De Zerbi's team were never under threat, with another ex-United player, Angel Gomes, breaking the deadlock after just 13 minutes.",
      "After that, the goals came thick and fast, with Greenwood finding the back of the net in the 26th minute with a left-footed effort. The 24-year-old, who left United for good in July 2024, grabbed his second goal shortly after the break to make it 5-0.",
      "After setting up Amine Gouiri with a cross and then CJ Egan-Riley with a pinpoint corner, Greenwood rounded off his hat-trick with the final kick of the game. That secured him the match ball and took his season's goal tally to 19 in all competitions.",
      "Greenwood played a part in five of his side's nine goals(Image: Getty Images)",

      "Michael Carrick takes charge of his first United training session(Image: )",
      "It's rarely quiet at Old Trafford but the first two weeks of 2026 have been explosive even for the standards of Manchester United. Michael Carrick is the club's third head coach of the year already.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dramatic end and Darren Fletcher's caretaker spell have led to the appointment of Carrick until the end of the season and the challenge that now awaits is to steer the club back into European competition.",
      "That won't be easy and the start is a daunting one, but there is now a sense of calm at Carrington once more. This is the story of a remarkable two weeks and how United got to the point where 44-year-old Carrick was summoned from a beach in Barbados to take charge of the first-team.",
      "There was frustration bubbling away at Carrington on the second day of 2026, but no sense of the explosion that was about to go off at the club's training ground.",
      "The failure to beat Wolves a few days earlier had stuck in the craw of key executives, particularly given Amorim had gone back to his favoured back three formation. Wolves boss Rob Edwards revealed post-match he had always expected Amorim to do just that, while the United head coach said he had wanted to match up the visitors.",
      "That negative approach set alarm bells ringing again. Amorim had gone to a back four and a more attacking ethos against Bournemouth and Newcastle, but reverted to type for a game against a team that, at that point, were still to win in the Premier League.",
      "When director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to Amorim about it at a pre-planned meeting on the morning of Friday, January 2, the head coach \"blew up\". He hinted at the unhappiness in his press conference ahead of the game and then cancelled a planned broadcast interview.",
      "The Amorim era came to a dramatic end at Leeds(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Two days later, he used the final question of his post-match press conference to essentially air his grievances with Wilcox in public. If it was a power play, it was never going to succeed.",
      "Amorim pulled into Carrington the next morning well aware he was about to be put out of his misery. His dismissal was about results, but it was also about his behaviour, not just in that showdown with Wilcox, but in the public criticisms he had aired against some players as well.",
      "There is a feeling that Amorim never quite 'got' United. He never understood the club's values or bought into the tradition of the type of football they should play. He certainly didn't sound like a United manager at times.",
      "It has been suggested that the 40-year-old was taken aback by the sheer scale of the task at hand and the noise that reverberates around the club. He called out people paying too much attention to pundits in his final press conference, but he has never had to deal with a struggling super club before and the spotlight will always be harsh.",
      "It's something Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag had to come to terms with as well, so with only 17 games left to salvage something from this season, United couldn't afford to appoint someone who needed time to get their feet under the table. That is why Wilcox looked to the days of United's past.",
      "Jonny Evans oversees United training on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "There was some schadenfreude at a shortlist of Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the nostalgia was deliberate. All three understand the club and are used to the noise. There will be no adaptation period required.",
      "In what became a straight shootout between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former's knowledge of a group of players who are yet to click together this season impressed Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. He is also a progressive appointment whose best days as a coach might be ahead of him, whereas it feels like Solskjaer's best days in management are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox also felt Carrick could work in a collaborative structure that Ineos are putting together at Old Trafford. He is a hands-on coach, whereas Solskjaer's experience at United is more managerial, although that is partly due to the absence of a clear structure when he was in charge between December 2018 and November 2021.",
      "Carrick's coaching pedigree helped him win the race and it didn't harm his cause that he had made an impact with some of these players as well. His three-game stint as a caretaker in 2021 is remembered fondly, but he also led much of the training when Solskjaer was in charge, along with Kieran McKenna.",
      "He is still a popular figure with some members of that squad who remain at Old Trafford and his ability to quickly assemble a coaching staff has gone down well. In particular, the appointment of experienced No. 2 Steve Holland is considered a wise move.",
      "For a while under Ineos, it felt like the sight of Holland pulling into Carrington was inevitable, alongside former England boss Sir Gareth Southgate. However, interest in Southgate has waned, and Holland's appointment isn't directly related.",
      "Instead, the search is now underway for a permanent head coach, although there is intrigue surrounding the removal of the word 'interim' or 'caretaker' from Carrick's job title. His job is simply that of head coach, albeit on a contract that runs until the end of the 2025/26 season. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2018 season, and Rangnick was the interim manager in November 2021.",
      "United stresses that those decisions were made under a different regime, and the decision not to use the words 'interim' or 'caretaker' is due to the length of time he will be in charge. The process to appoint a permanent head coach will be a thorough one, but Carrick will inevitably be in the picture. The results will dictate the strength of his case.",
      "Carrick, Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were in place at Carrington on Wednesday morning to welcome the players. There were \"good vibes\" around the place, as one source put it.",
      "Plenty of the squad already know Carrick and some know Holland as well. Carrick's career means he commands respect from the squad. He held a relatively brief introductory team meeting on Wednesday morning before a first training session on the grass which was watched by Wilcox.",
      "Gym work followed for many of the squad, but there were no significant changes implemented by Carrick on day one. Although club media filmed some of the session, there was a desire not to reveal too much.",
      "There will be two more sessions before City arrive on Saturday and the Carrick era truly begins.",

      "Michael Carrick took his first Manchester United training session on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick had two Premier League games in charge of Manchester United during his caretaker spell in 2021. The opponents? Arsenal and Chelsea.",
      "Five years on, Carrick is back in the dugout at United and this time it's Manchester City first up. The derby at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime is jam-packed with narrative as Pep Guardiola brings his Blues, unbeaten in 13 games and chasing down Arsenal at the top of the Premier League, across Manchester.",
      "Carrick oversaw his first United training session on Wednesday and will have had limited time working with the players and faces some tough decisions with his first selection. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad are back from Africa Cup of Nations duty and the new manager must decide whether to put both straight into the XI.",
      "If he does, then someone has to make way. That could be Mathues Cunha if Carrick deploys a 4-2-3-1 formation and opts for Bruno Fernandes as a number 10 behind Benjamin Sesko. Cunha hasn't quite hit his straps since joining in the summer and is the most vulnerable attack-minded player at risk of dropping out.",
      "Carrick's other option would be to play Fernandes as part of the central midfield two, most likely alongside Casemiro. That would allow space for Cunha further forward but no room for Kobbie Mainoo, who started both of Darren Fletcher's two matches in charge. The youngster was overlooked in the main by Ruben Amorim and will be hoping a change of manager represents a change in fortunes.",
      "The risk with playing Fernandes further back is the danger of City overrunning the United midfield with their pace, power and possession. Mainoo may not be a natural holding player, but he is more defensively aware than his skipper and played a similar role in England's run to the final of the last European Championships.",
      "It's an early call for Carrick that could define his first game. He'll hope to get it right.",

      "Manchester United welcomed back attacking duo Amad and Bryan Mbeumo on Wednesday, with the pair both taking part in Michael Carrick's first training session as head coach, with the 44-year-old stepping up preparations for his first game in charge this weekend.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo were knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations at the quarter-final stage and have now returned to full training at Carrington and are expected to be available for Carrick's first game, against Manchester City on Saturday. Mbeumo's Cameroon were beaten by the host nation, Morocco, last Friday, while Amad and the Ivory Coast were knocked out on Saturday after losing 3-2 to Egypt.",
      "It means Noussair Mazraoui is the only member of United's AFCON trio still involved in the competition. The versatile full-back will feature for Morocco when they take on Nigeria on Wednesday evening.",
      "Carrick and his assistant Steve Holland oversaw training on Wednesday, having had the chance to get their feet under the table on Tuesday when the players had a scheduled day off.",
      "Their first session included exciting young winger Shea Lacey, who is suspended for the visit of City after being sent off against Brighton in the FA Cup last weekend. Darren Fletcher's twin sons, Jack and Tyler, also continued their involvement in the first-team training squad.",
      "There was a place for 20-year-old full-back Habeeb Ogunneye, who was recalled from a loan spell at League Two outfit Newport County this week. Ogunneye made 15 appearances in League Two, but hasn't played in that competition since a 3-0 defeat to Oldham on November 22.",
      "The return of Amad and Mbeumo is a particular bonus for Carrick, who faces a daunting start to his time in charge, with the Manchester derby at Old Trafford this weekend, followed by a trip to Arsenal.",
      "\"Coming into this club from the very start, the big games, the important games, it's what we all live for,\" said Carrick. \"Some are more challenging than others, but it's why we're here, so we'll go for it head-on.",
      "\"Hopefully we can play a really exciting type of football, be positive and express and bring excitement. I want to be off my seat. I want to be enjoying watching the boys play. And results obviously need to come with that. I can feel my enthusiasm for it because I'm buzzing to get started and see what we can do.\"",

      "Michael Carrick's target is to get Manchester United back in the Champions League(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher lifted the veil on Manchester United's season when he so expressly laid down a return to the Champions League as the primary target for the remaining 17 games of the campaign. Forget just qualifying for Europe, it is the top table where United want to be sitting.",
      "They begin the Michael Carrick era in seventh in the Premier League, but a congested table offers them hope, although it might look a little less packed once the 44-year-old has navigated games against Manchester City and Arsenal over the next couple of weeks.",
      "United are on 32 points after 21 games. Continue on that trajectory and it is clear it won't be enough. There is also a feeling they have just wasted a heaven-sent run of fixtures and that Carrick will now face a more demanding schedule.",
      "There is at least the consolation of fifth place once again being almost certain to secure Champions League football next season. Brentford currently occupy that position, which suggests the race is still wide open. It would be a seismic shock if Keith Andrews' side were still there at the end of May.",
      "A glance through recent history shows what United should be aiming for. The last five Premier League seasons all ended with fifth place, earning between 66 and 69 points. On three occasions, it was 66 points, and that is the route Carrick should be aiming for.",
      "That is because Brentford's current tally of 33 points is below the total of the fifth-place team at this stage of the last five campaigns. They all had between 36 and 40 points. That opens up the possibility of a lower total doing the job this season, but United aren't the only side hoping to finish strongly.",
      "So if 66 points should be the target for fifth, how do United get there? They need 34 points from their final 17 games, which is clearly a challenge. Ten wins and four draws would do it, or 11 wins and a draw.",
      "Given Carrick's tenure starts with games against the top two, it is a challenge. If the games against Manchester City and Arsenal end without victory, it will become 11 wins from 15 games.",
      "United also face games against Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, and Liverpool during Carrick's time in charge, all of who are likely to be battling them for a top-four or top-five finish.",
      "They will need to rediscover a sense of strength at Old Trafford, having endured a dismal run of home form that could prove costly come the end of the season. If Carrick can land home wins against Fulham, Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Leeds, Brentford and Nottingham Forest, then he is halfway there.",
      "Three wins away from games against West Ham, Everton, Bournemouth, Sunderland and Brighton would be a solid return. That leaves two more to get.",
      "A trip to Newcastle in March looks tricky, as does Stamford Bridge in April. Maybe the best chance of victories are home games against Aston Villa and Liverpool. Two of those four fixtures against Champions League rivals might need to end with three points.",
      "Follow that plan and land 11 wins out of 17 games, and Carrick should have achieved what he has been appointed to do. Reach the Champions League, and who knows what the future holds.",
      "Carrick's 11 wins: Fulham (H), Tottenham (H), West Ham (A), Everton (A), Crystal Palace (H), Aston Villa (H), Leeds (H), Brentford (H), Liverpool (H), Sunderland (A), Nottingham Forest (H)",

      "United confirmed the appointment of Michael Carrick as interim head coach on Tuesday evening. The former midfielder has joined until the end of the season as he looks to help the club finish as high in the table as possible.",
      "Carrick beat off competition from the likes of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy for the role. He will take charge of his match on Saturday when United host rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked by Jamie Carragher on the Stick to Football podcast if Carrick has got the chance of getting the job on a full-time basis, Neville gave a clear answer: “To be fair, I’ve got a lot of time for Ole, I’ve got a lot of time for Ruud and a lot of time for Carrick,” he said.",
      "“They’re great lads, I hope he [Carrick] does really well. They cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond this season - for Michael and for the club - even if he wins every game.",
      "“We could be sat here at the end of the season where he’s done unbelievably well, fans are up and they’re in the Champions League, it could happen. We could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "“I honestly feel like when you’ve got Pochettino, Tuchel and Ancelotti...I’ve said Ancelotti because he’s 66 years of age and he’s probably got one more job left at club level. If there was one person who has got the patience, composure and experience of the Premier League [it's him].”",
      "Carlos Ancelotti has been named as a preferred pick for the permanent Manchester United job by Gary Neville(Image: Ruano Carneiro/Getty Images)",

      "“Who can handle the owners and get across them? Who plays the style of play and idea that United fans will like to watch?",
      "“Who has got that Champions League experience and big club experience? Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino.",

      "Michael Carrick has beaten Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the interim head coach job at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "11 weeks ago, Michael Carrick thought it had clicked. He sat in the Match of the Day studio, a beaming smile on his face, and talked about the connections that were starting to develop in the Manchester United team. He could see players who were enjoying their football again and a team that had \"a sense of fun\". He was having fun watching them.",
      "Life comes at you fast around these parts. Carrick will swap the casual sweater and the lapel mic for a suit and a tactics board this weekend when he leads United out against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The smiles have long gone and he will encounter frowns and grimaces when he greets the players at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Carrick's effusive assessment of a United performance on Match of the Day came after the 4-2 win against Brighton. It was a third straight win and one of the best Premier League performances under Ruben Amorim. It felt like the Amorim era was finally going somewhere.",
      "As it turned out, it was another dead end. Only three of the next 11 games were won before Amorim pressed for the ejector button in spectacular fashion. Now Carrick has to pick up the pieces in a campaign he thought was well on track not so long ago.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox have conducted a tour of United's old boys over the past week and have faced criticism for doing so. They have been lambasted for not having a plan after sacking Amorim. However, there is a reason for this, and that is nobody expected Amorim to explode in the manner he did and as quickly as he did.",
      "Tensions came to a head at astonishing speed and within a matter of days the Portuguese went from retaining the support of the United hierarchy to seeing his position become untenable. Even for the soap opera of the modern-day United, it was a whirlwind.",
      "In the circumstances, this is probably as good a move as Berrada and Wilcox could have made. They resisted the temptation to get too sepia with the return of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, instead opting for the sensible route with a coach whose best years are ahead of him.",
      "It's not easy to see where Solskjaer's next job comes from if it wasn't answering a distress call at Old Trafford. For Carrick, 44, there is still the promise of a bright coaching career ahead. If this stint goes well for him, then there is every chance a Premier League job is on offer next season, even if it isn't at Old Trafford.",
      "He also fits more smoothly into a new structure at United. Solskjaer was more of a manager during his three years in charge, while Carrick is more of a coach, although there is a question as to how much this job is actually going to be about coaching. These players will relish returning to a simpler system after 14 months of looking lost under Amorim.",
      "Carrick will opt for a shape they all know and understand, and while he has more time on the training ground than most - too much, probably - it is unlikely he is going to seek to introduce complicated pressing structures or patterns of play to them. Ralf Rangnick tried that, after all.",
      "What is needed is a motivator who can pick the players up after a dismal run of form and a dramatic few weeks that have visibly stripped the group of confidence and belief. Heads have dropped and there aren't enough leaders on the pitch dragging them forward.",
      "Carrick can do that, as can his experienced assistant Steve Holland, who was a driving force behind the throne for England when working with Gareth Southgate. Whether they can deliver Carrick's possession-heavy template in what is left of the season remains to be seen.",
      "He might only have spent 10 days in charge as caretaker in 2021, but he delivered an upturn in results and United players liked the cut of his jib. His training was bright, and he earned credit for the way he stabilised a team that had just conceded four goals to Watford.",
      "Wins against Villarreal and Arsenal were impressive and Carrick's United were good value for a point at Stamford Bridge. It might only be three games, but he has earned a shot at the job ahead of Solskjaer.",
      "He might also be looking forward to an easier assignment or two. His first game in charge was a Champions League tie in Spain and his first four Premier League games will now be against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Arsenal. If he is still unbeaten in two weeks' time, then Berrada and Wilcox will know for sure they have the right man.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo should get more chances at United under a coaching staff aware of his talents(Image: )",
      "Six months ago, Michael Carrick reflected on Kobbie Mainoo's situation at Manchester United and felt that all he was missing was a bit of luck. Show a bit of patience, and that break would arrive.",
      "Now, it has, in the form of Carrick taking over from Ruben Amorim until the end of the season. Mainoo has gone from a coach who had misgivings about him and playing a system that never suited him, to one who's made his thoughts on the midfielder clear and should have a role that is ideal for him.",
      "The next four-and-a-half months are significant for many people at United, from Carrick to the players, and up to Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada. But they are massive for Mainoo.",
      "Had Amorim not pressed the self-destruct button a couple of weeks ago, then the 20-year-old could have ended the month playing for Napoli in Serie A. Instead, he will stay at United, and now it feels like his future is back in his hands.",
      "The sacking of Amorim hasn't entirely wiped the slate clean. Mainoo has just 18 months left on his contract, and talks over an extension have stalled, leaving him as one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023.",
      "The chances of landing the kind of contract the academy graduate feels he deserves were slim to non-existent under Amorim, who handed him just 212 minutes of Premier League football this season, with none of them coming from the start. It felt like the clock was ticking towards an inevitable and sad conclusion.",
      "That has all changed in a couple of weeks. Mainoo was lacking rhythm when he started against Brighton in the FA Cup last weekend, but if he gets more chances under Carrick, that will return, and he can prove he is worthy of new terms. Carrick, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents last July, certainly sounded like a fan of the youngster.",
      "“I’ve seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom to create and take the ball, and I think he’s got a massive future,” Carrick said. “I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience, and that little bit of a break again, which I’m sure he’ll get.\"",
      "Maybe he is the man to offer him a change in fortunes. Amorim always billed Mainoo's fight to get in the side as a battle with Bruno Fernandes, so it will be interesting to see if Carrick sees a midfield where both men can play.",
      "He is likely to set United up in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 shape and there should be room for both. At Middlesbrough, Carrick marked himself out as someone who valued possession and his comments to Ferdinand suggest he sees Mainoo as more of a No. 8, someone who plays around the opposition's penalty area rather than his own.",
      "Mainoo also has an existing relationship with Carrick's assistant Steve Holland. The 55-year-old was Gareth Southgate's No. 2 and played a part in Mainoo's rapid rise to senior England recognition and his excellent form during Euro 2024, which culminated in him starting the final.",
      "That support and those familiar voices should be beneficial for the Stockport-born midfielder as he looks to get his United career back on track. Over the next few months, he has the chance to prove he is currently undervalued at Old Trafford and secure his long-term future at the club.",

      "Manchester United star Lisandro Martinez admits he thought about retiring following his injury hell.(Image: )",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez has revealed he considered giving up football - and retiring - after suffering from a horror ACL injury last year. The 27-year-old spent nine months on the sidelines after picking up the injury in a 2-0 defeat against Crystal Palace in February.",
      "He underwent surgery on the injury and missed the end of last season, along with the beginning of the current campaign, before returning to action against the Eagles in the 2-1 win over Oliver Glasner's side at the end of November. The former Ajax man has had his fair share of injury problems since his £55million move to Old Trafford from the Netherlands in July 2022.",
      "The defender was, reportedly, involved in a training ground confrontation with Ruben Amorim over the Christmas period, prior to the Portuguese head coach's departure from Old Trafford. Martinez is alleged to have wanted more game-time having spent the last nine months out, claiming he was ready to do his bit for the team.",
      "Now, in an interview with AFA Estudio, the United defender admits he thought about calling time on his career.",
      "\"You feel like you're not a football player anymore,\" Martinez said. \"You feel pain and think you'll never play football again.",
      "\"A mental and physical imbalance, which, honestly, when I think about it today, I don't know how I did it. I clung to the people around me, my family, my friends.",
      "Ruben Amorim (left) and Lisandro Martinez (centre) reportedly fell out. (Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"After the first two or three weeks, to be honest, I didn't want to play football anymore. And then, of course, you become more aware, you get that support.\"",
      "Martinez also fractured his metatarsal back in April 2023, which kept him out for the remainder of that campaign, needing a second operation on the injury which kept him out for 180 days across two spells.",
      "It kept him out of the FA Cup defeat to Man City that season, and injury also kept him out of the Europea League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last year.",
      "When asked about his recovery, Martinez added: \"You need to not take the easy way out. The easy way out is to just give up and that's it.",
      "\"But, I always say, it's in the face of adversity that you show your true character. So I reconnected with myself, I reconnected with my roots, with who I am, with my values, and I gave it my all, day after day.",
      "\"For me, it was day by day, a constant struggle, and my match was every day at the gym. Then, well, I had therapy with my psychologist, always trying to improve in every aspect - and then I was clear about what I wanted, right?",
      "\"To try to become the best version of myself, to give my best, to see how far I could go.",
      "\"And the truth is that with each passing month, I saw the results, I saw how I was getting stronger, and today, on the pitch, I feel excellent, and I say that thanks to those days, well, of suffering, of not giving up - today we have the results.\"",

      "Tyrell Malacia is set for talks over his immediate future with Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick. The 26-year-old was part of the club's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, but those four all secured exits from Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "It was a permanent move to Chelsea for the latter with Antony re-joining Real Betis, Rashford signing for Barcelona on a season-long loan and Sancho making a temporary switch to Aston Villa. Malacia was primed for a deadline day move to Elche, but that collapsed at the eleventh hour.",
      "Despite being frozen and spending the following two months out of the team, the Dutchmen returned to the fold as an unused substitute for the 4-2 win over Brighton. He was named in the following six squads before coming on for the final two minutes against Newcastle United.",
      "Injured stars returning have resulted in him featuring for the under-21s and he scored in a 45-minute appearance for the developmental side against Wolves earlier this week. With his future unclear, Malacia is looking for clarity from Carrick before making a final decision, according to The Sun.",
      "He has entered the final few months of his contract at Old Trafford and as such, a winter window exit has not been ruled out. It has been claimed that there is interest in Malacia but none of those current options appeal to him.",
      "Michael Carrick is already set for talks over the future of one Manchester United player(Image: (Photo by Paul Harding/Getty Images))",
      "United are not expected to sanction any transfers this month but the return of three players over the coming days will feel like new signings.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad have already returned to training at Carrington after Cameroon and the Ivory Coast were eliminated from AFCON. Noussair Mazraoui is still at the tournament with Morocco, but will be back in England next week regardless of what happens in the remaining games.",
      "Harry Maguire joined Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo as recent returners from injury last weekend after a two-month absence, though Matthijs de Ligt is still unavailable.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has missed the last few months with injury(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Despite that, the club's former midfielder, who managed Middlesbrough for three years, is excited by the task that awaits him and several other ex-United stars.",

      "“I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "“There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.”",
      "It has been confirmed that the 44-year-old will be joined in the dugout by former England assistant by Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion, Jonny Evans and Craig Mawson.",

      "Ryan Giggs had his say on Kobbie Mainoo(Image: Jan Kruger/Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has revealed he would like to see Kobbie Mainoo stay at the club as a deadline approaches for a decision on his future. The young midfielder had been widely linked to a number of clubs before Ruben Amorim was sacked earlier this month.",
      "Michael Carrick has now been placed in charge until the end of the season and quickly has the Manchester derby to take his attention. But little over two weeks are available to shape his squad and to ship out any unwanted players before the transfer deadline.",
      "Mainoo is set to remain at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and was rejected the opportunity to move on loan earlier in the term, with Napoli interested. But come the summer, he will reach the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "Talks over an extension have stalled, and Mainoo remains one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023. Chelsea have even been said to be lurking.",
      "The 20-year-old has started just twice in 2025/26, and both have come with cup exits. Giggs reckons Mainoo must show patience.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United,\" Giggs told BetSelect.",
      "Michael Carrick is in charge of Kobbie Mainoo for now(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "\"But yeah, we all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "\"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",
      "It appears Carrick already has a vision for how to best use Mainoo. Speaking to Rio Ferdinand in September, Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker.",
      "\"I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating.",
      "\"I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Patience could yet be key as Mainoo seems likely to remain in competition with Bruno Fernandes unless Carrick opts to use the England international in a midfield pairing, while Fernandes becomes United's No.10.",

Carrick was joined by his assistants Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, while first team coaches Jonny Evans, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson also got involved.",

      "The ex-United midfielder has agreed a deal with United's hierarchy and been chosen over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to take the role until the end of the season. Carrick has brought former England assistant manager Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion in to be part of his staff.",

      "Diogo Dalot may not have enjoyed a stellar period across a number of positions, but a switch to a back four will see a return to a more natural full-back position. The same will be true for Noussair Mazraoui, whose versatility has been useful.",

      "Dorgu has been utilised in the front line of late, but could find opportunities dry up once Bryan Mbeumo and Amad return from AFCON.",
      "Mason Mount's position will be more uncertain in Carrick's formation. The ex-Chelsea star is not supremely suited to being a winger and could find himself in direct competition with Fernandes, not a promising place for many, unless he takes a deeper role.",
      "United's central defenders will be left fighting for fewer positions. Shaw may be safe on the left, but the impressive Ayden Heaven may now find minutes more difficult to come by as a junior member of the side.",
      "Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt may also have concerns about their pace highlighted in the new shape.",
      "Amad's position becomes uncertain under Carrick. The Ivory Coast star rarely let Amorim down, but the Portuguese coach often squeezed the player into the side as a wing-back.",
      "The ex-Sunderland loanee is good enough to challenge further up the field but faces the difficult challenge of competing with Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Matheus Cunha will remain the favourite to start on the left wing but may need a period of adjustment from playing on the left side under Amorim. The Brazilian has struggled out wide in recent matches and will probably prefer a narrower role if it can be facilitated.",

      "The 41-year-old was part of the coaching staff when United fell apart under Ralf Rangnick four years ago and although this squad is clearly more unified than that group, Fletcher accepts it could be another season when some players fail the kind of test that Old Trafford offers.",
      "United have fallen at the first hurdle in both cup competitions and will play just 40 games this season. If Michael Carrick is to take charge for the remainder of the season, he has just 17 games in four-and-a-half months. There will be long gaps between games, but as miserable as everything feels right now, Champions League qualification is still a possibility this season.",
      "Fletcher used his press conference after the defeat to Brighton to lay down that challenge to the players, while making it abundantly clear it is up to them to raise themselves as well. If they fail to do so, then it might spell the end for a few.",
      "\"True character reveals itself in difficult times. We learned a lot about a lot of the players in that situation [in 2021/22],\" said Fletcher. \"That will be the same about these lads now. In difficult times, true character is going to show. So they have to dig in, show they want to be part of Manchester United's future, learn from this.",
      "\"And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. Sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Every player should take that advice on board and deliver a run of performances in training and on the pitch that shows the future can belong to them. If United qualify for the Champions League this season, a campaign in danger of being wasted will be salvaged and the future will look brighter.",
      "Whatever happens, there is a group of players who have probably done enough to be part of the club next season. They include summer signings Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, although Cunha is at a point where he needs to raise his game a level or two.",
      "There are also a group of defenders who will stick around. Leny Yoro hasn't had a great season but faith in his ability to be one of Europe's top centre-backs remains high, while Ayden Heaven is clearly one for the future as well. Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez should be safe.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has been a reliable servant since signing from Bayern Munich and has already shown he has the right character. Luke Shaw is closer to the end than the beginning, but with his contract expiring in 2027, it would make sense to keep him for one more year.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future should be safe now that Ruben Amorim has departed and Bruno Fernandes should clearly stay, although it feels like that decision will come down to what the captain wants. Amad is another whose future is rock solid.",
      "Beyond that, there are question marks everywhere you look. Tom Heaton, Harry Maguire and Casemiro are out of contract. Maguire might yet earn an extension but there's a chance all three depart. Joshua Zirkzee might survive the January window, but he will be off in the summer, and Altay Bayindir is also likely to want a move. Tyrell Malacia's United career has long been over.",
      "Diogo Dalot might consider himself unfortunate to be on the list, but the 26-year-old has had a disappointing season and at some point it feels like there will be an upgrade at right-back. Patrick Dorgu needs to prove he can hit the heights required of a United player, either at left-back or on the wing.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has rarely looked up to the task since moving from Paris St-Germain and needs a big finish to the season. The same could arguably be true for Mason Mount, who has had a better season but still has question marks around his fitness and the level of his contribution. In a year when the midfield is set for a major revamp, the former Chelsea man is vulnerable.",
      "For all of those players, the next few weeks and months will be a litmus test. It is one they need to pass.",

      "Former England No.2 Steve Holland will be Michael Carrick's assistant at Manchester United, with the duo set to take training for the first time on Wednesday.",
      "Carrick's appointment as interim head coach is set to be confirmed later on Tuesday and he is bringing in the experience of Holland with him. The 55-year-old worked under Gareth Southgate with England and also had a lengthy stint at Chelsea. His most recent role saw him dismissed as manager of Japanese outfit Yokohama F Marinos in April.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion will also be part of Carrick's backroom staff. Former Leeds United defender Woodgate was Carrick's No.2 at Middlesbrough, while Evans and Binnion have been assisting Darren Fletcher for the games against Burnley and Brighton last week.",
      "Evans was appointed as a first-team coach before the trip to Turf Moor, while Binnion was promoted from his role in the academy and he will stay with the first-team set-up for the rest of the season.",
      "Fletcher oversaw a draw at Burnley and a defeat to Brighton in his two games in charge. The 41-year-old was aware his interim spell was only going to be two games and he was never a serious candidate for the role until the end of the season, with United seeking experience for the rest of the campaign.",
      "The Scot was offered the chance to stay on the first-team staff under Carrick, but he has opted to return to his role as head coach of the Under-18s for the rest of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as a frontrunner for the job after impressing chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox in face-to-face talks last Thursday. Deals have now been agreed with the 44-year-old and his coaching staff and the appointments are set to be finalised today.",
      "Their first game in charge will be against Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.",

      "Michael Carrick has some big decisions to make when he takes charge of Manchester United(Image: DeFodi Images via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is set to become the new Manchester United interim head coach this week after an agreement was reached in principle to give the former midfielder the job until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick's first game in charge of United will be Saturday's Manchester derby, before he takes charge of the final 16 games of the Premier League season. With no domestic cup competitions to compete for, the objective is to seal Champions League football for next season.",
      "It's understood that United will only strengthen Carrick's squad on two conditions. The first being if long-term targets become available, and if they need to prevent other teams from taking pole position to sign a player they are monitoring.",
      "A long list of players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, predominantly midfielders. The position is a priority at Old Trafford with Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba all on their radar. Still, it is expected that any move will be made until the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Neves' contract at Al-Hilal expires in June 2026 and he is a real target for Manchester United this month(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Yet there are a couple of deals that could materialise this window due to the two conditions set and the opportunity in the market. When Carrick takes charge of United, his strongest team will welcome the arrival of two players.",
      "Starting in goal, Senne Lammens is the first choice, and that isn't changing. With Carrick expected to bring his 4-2-3-1 style of play to Old Trafford, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez are all options at centre-back.",
      "However, Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi is available after deciding not to renew his contract. The Argentine's current deal expires in the summer, meaning he is free to agree a pre-contract with clubs in Europe.",
      "Marcos Senesi's contract at Bournemouth is due to expire at the end of the season(Image: AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images)",
      "That doesn't rule out United striking this month, and the prospect of losing him for nothing is likely to force Bournemouth to accept an offer. At 30, the centre-back improves United's backline and would fit into Carrick's back four with no trouble.",
      "Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu will contend for the left-back role, with the former impressing this season upon returning to full fitness. At right-back, Noussair Mazraoui's absence due to AFCON has been telling with Diogo Dalot underperforming.",
      "The midfield pivot is the big question mark, and Carrick will give each player a clean canvas. Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are the three natural central midfielders, but there are concerns. Casemiro's presence leaves United lacking legs, and Ugarte's adaptation to England has been a struggle.",
      "Mainoo would be many people's first choice in midfield, and there are worries over his partner. The bargain deal to sign Ruben Neves, understood to be around £20million, would crush that trouble.",
      "The Al-Hilal midfielder, like Senesi, is in the final six months of his contract in Saudi Arabia and has previously turned down extension offers. United previously wanted Neves before his move away from Wolves, and at £20m, he would be the ideal midfielder improvement for Carrick.",
      "Carrick has a fortune of riches in the final third with United's strongest position by some distance. Captain Bruno Fernandes is a guarantee in the No. 10 position; it's his best position, and there isn't a better option.",
      "Bruno Fernandes will be a key player in Michael Carrick's tenure at the club(Image: 2020 Getty Images)",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will both return from AFCON in time for United's clash against Manchester City, adding some much-needed firepower to the final third. Since signing from Brentford in the summer, Mbeumo has scored six goals in the Premier League and has often been United's most dangerous player.",
      "For Amad, his versatility means he is within a shout of playing in several positions. The left-wing role will see one of Amad or Matheus Cunha start, both players having their strengths and weaknesses that make it a tough decision for Carrick.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the default option at centre-forward after United coughed up £74m for him in the summer. After a difficult opening five months in England, the striker has still scored five goals, including three in the last two games.",
      "Away from the strongest XI, Carrick has good options off the bench. Dorgu, Dalot and Yoro all offer quality in defence when required, as do Casemiro and Ugarte. In attack, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount have both proved they can make a difference when called upon and Shea Lacey's emergence provides the excitement fans want to see.",
      "Carrick's strongest potential United XI (4-2-3-1): Lammens; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Senesi, Shaw; Neves, Mainoo; Mbeumo, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Yet Keane famously fell out with Ferguson when he left the club in acrimonious circumstances in November 2005, with his animosity towards his former manager barely waning more than two decades later.",

      "Those comments predictably created a stir, with Pallister suggesting Keane was wrong to reopen his feud with Ferguson, as he encouraged new United interim manager Michael Carrick to seek out the advice of his former manager after taking on the role at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "“I wouldn’t agree with Roy. I think those comments have more to do with the relationship between the two of them,” Pallister told Football365 with Spreadex Sports.",
      "“We know there is no love lost there. There is not going to be any bouquets being exchanged between those two [Ferguson and Keane].",
      "“He also had a little go at David Gill as well, but David was a consummate professional and a great guy to work with.",
      "“Listen, you expect Roy to be controversial and he doesn’t disappoint, but I’m sure Michael Carrick will speak to Sir Alex about the job he has taken on and he would be mad not to.",
      "“I always remember sitting down and chatting to Sir Alex about his difficult times and that was just after I arrived at the club and the banners were there saying, ‘Enough is Enough’ and ‘Fergie Out’.",

      "“Sir Alex said speaking to the club’s greatest manager at the time was invaluable and why wouldn’t you lean on all of those years of experience? Especially with someone who has been manager at Manchester United. It’s a difficult place to manage because the expectation is huge.”",
      "Pallister went on to give his verdict on Amorim’s exit, as he suggested the Portuguese tactician appeared to throw in the towel when he knew the axe was about to fall after a fall-out with Sporting Director Jason Wilcox.",

      "“In the end, you have got to base it on results and his winning ratio wasn’t great and even though he was given the backing of the club, results speak louder than words.",
      "“It was better than last year, but did we have any real confidence of getting into the Champions League slots? I don’t think so.",
      "“What was damning in the end was the Newcastle game. We went to four at the back, we got a result and while you can say Newcastle deserved something from that game, we all waited to see what would happen next.",
      "“Then he went to five at the back for the Wolves and people were asking why he went for that when statistically, they were playing one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. It didn’t make sense.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen says Senne Lammens is “not good enough” to be Manchester United’s first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp for £18m in the summer, replacing the much maligned Andre Onana as the Red Devils’ No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The 23-year-old made just 52 senior appearances for the Belgian side before making the switch to Old Trafford and has impressed the majority with his mature performances this season.",
      "But Meulensteen, who served under Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford from 2007 to 2013, believes that while Lammens is “potentially a really good goalkeeper” , he is is “not ready” to be United’s No.1.",
      "“I do think that United have quite a few individuals in the squad who, in my opinion, are not good enough for Man United,’ Meulensteen said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast.",
      "“They concede far too many goals, defensively they’re not solid, and every team analyses that, and every team that has the quality and the courage, you’re going to create things.",
      "“I think if you look at the top, top teams, look at Arsenal, they’ve got a really good goalkeeper, Liverpool good goalkeeper, City, United it’s not good enough, the goalkeepers are not good enough.",
      "“This Lammens boy is potentially a really good goalkeeper. I don’t think at this moment in time he’s ready, and he’s not good enough, for this moment in time, that’s my opinion.",

      "Meulensteen insists Carrick must focus on fixing United’s defensive issues having seen the Red Devils struggle to plug gaps in the two games under Darren Fletcher.",
      "“I rate him, I rated him highly as a player and he was a very intelligent player, I think he did a really good job at Middlesbrough, obviously I know a little bit more about it because my son worked there for a year as an analyst,” said Meulensteen.",
      "“I think he’ll know what to do, but he has to go in there and be really, really clear to the players.",
      "“He has to work in certain aspects, coaching on that pitch is going to be vital because they need to start getting clean sheets. That transition going from that system of Amorim into a 4-2-3-1, or a 4-3-3, however you want to defend, your shape has to be coached.",
      "“What I saw in both of the games [under Darren Fletcher], there’s gaps all over the place and opposition will exploit that. He has to come in, especially in the games against City and Arsenal coming up, and make sure that’s sorted.",
      "“I trust him in his football ability and intelligence to get that right. I don’t think it’s too difficult to fix, in my opinion. If all the players are available I wouldn’t know exactly what my best line-up would be because you would have to work with players and see what the best connections are at the back, we talked about the goalkeeper issue, in the midfield there’s issues there, but front wise, there’s plenty of power in terms of creating and scoring goals.”",

      "In what has been called a ‘close-run’ race between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former won for a variety of reasons, as predictably detailed by the numerous inside stories published since.",
      "They explain how director of football Jason Wilcox told the players that Champions League qualification was their target for the remainder of the season – they were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton days later so good work – and that He Knows The Club was indeed their bar for caretaker consideration.",
      "Wilcox made first contact with Carrick and Solskjaer over the phone on Tuesday, conducted face-to-face meetings with them on Thursday and Saturday respectively, then relayed the club’s decision the following week.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy, bless him, was interviewed over the phone and promptly rejected.",
      "All three ‘impressed’ but Carrick was, as phrased by many writers, the ‘unanimous choice’ in the end.",
      "But much like in the hours after Amorim’s demise, a great many journalists with contacts in and around Old Trafford have shared what went down in that fateful week leading up to Carrick’s anointment.",
      "",
      "Roy Keane might well have sensed “a bad smell” emanating from the halls of Carrington in the week of Amorim’s dismissal, for Sir Alex Ferguson had a degree of involvement from the off in deciding the Portuguese’s successor.",
      "Rob Dawson and Mark Ogden of ESPN write that Ferguson was called to ‘a breakfast meeting’ with Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada two days after Amorim was sacked, which ‘set the course’ for Carrick’s eventual coronation.",
      "Ferguson ‘was invited into the training ground to give his verdict on the manager search,’ with Wilcox a source adding:",
      "“Omar and Jason spoke to Sir Alex. They met over breakfast to discuss three guys who had all played under him in the past. Some might criticize that, so you can’t win. But Sir Alex knows Michael, Ole and Ruud better than anyone, so Omar and Jason canvassed his opinion.”",
      "The ESPN pair add that it is not known ‘whether Ferguson directly anointed Carrick as his favoured choice,’ but the Scot is described as ‘wholly positive about his former midfielder and fully supports his appointment’.",
      "Four Athletic writers team up, however, to say that of the final choices Solskjaer and Carrick, Ferguson is ‘known to have favoured the latter’s candidacy’.",
      "Carrick will be giving him a call soon.",
      "",
      "If the many reports are to be believed, Ferguson might well prescribe to a widespread notion summed up by the oft-cited difference between Carrick and Solskjaer, as summed up by one phrase: ‘more hands-on’.",
      "ESPN, The Athletic and BBC Sport all use that wording to explain in part how Carrick edged ahead of Solskjaer in the race.",
      "Sami Mokbel of the BBC says that the idea Carrick ‘arguably provides greater hands-on coaching expertise than Solskjaer was at the heart’ of Manchester United’s decision.",
      "The general vibes-based approach of Solskjaer was a ‘key consideration’ in the early stages of the process as the desperation to ‘inspire a squad so clearly in need of a pick-me-up’ was identified, but Carrick’s general coaching acumen ‘ultimately became one of the overriding factors behind the decision’.",
      "Another tick for Carrick was his willingness to operate within the Manchester United power structure, which basically means he is fine getting daily texts off Wilcox and Ratcliffe with tactical ideas based on Gary Neville’s latest podcast.",
      "‘He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.’",
      "That greater understanding of the current squad is echoed by other outlets as another advantage Carrick held over Solskjaer, who presumably asked where Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard were.",
      "The well-connected Rich Fay says Carrick’s ‘strong knowledge of the players’ at his disposal was a positive, with the Athletic appraising his ‘pre-existing knowledge of the squad’.",
      "We simply must know who Solskjaer thinks is still there.",
      "Carrick’s philosophy also ‘aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play,’ according to Dorsett and Khan, who say there was ‘a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable’.",
      "Mokbel touts a reported switch to a 4-2-3-1 formation, adding that ‘it also has not gone unnoticed by United chiefs’ that Carrick ‘oversaw a transition from a three-at-the-back system deployed by predecessor Chris Wilder’.",
      "And when Carrick ‘outlined his vision for the remainder of the campaign’, Wilcox and Berrada were described as ‘impressed by those plans, as well as Carrick’s enthusiasm for taking on the role,’ according to Mark Critchley and others of The Athletic.",
      "",
      "In some ways it was a race Solskjaer lost as much as one Carrick won.",
      "It is claimed by numerous outlets that the Norwegian was eager to discuss a more permanent arrangement. The Athletic say his ‘preference would have been to take the job again on a permanent basis, working for the long term’ on ‘a major rebuild’.",
      "But another phrase which crops up regularly in these insides stories is ‘backwards step’; Solskjaer’s three-year reign at Old Trafford seemed to count as much against him as for in the end.",
      "Carrick, however, expressed a ‘willingness to take on the role with no guarantee’ of anything beyond the end of the season.",
      "One of Solskjaer’s biggest issues was the composition of his backroom staff. The Athletic call that a ‘stumbling block’ considering his last assistants at Old Trafford were Carrick and current Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, neither of whom would be prepared to back him up this time around.",
      "That was especially pertinent, as this line from Mokbel makes clear of Solskjaer:",
      "‘It is also acknowledged that much of the coaching during his reign was completed by Carrick and McKenna, who were his assistants.’",
      "One last obstacle for Solskjaer is presented by Pete Hall of The I Paper, who points out that ‘in the eyes of Ineos’ power brokers’, Carrick ‘has more recent experience in the dugout’ than Solskjaer, whose only spell since leaving Manchester United in November 2021 – a seven-month reign ended by his sacking at Besiktas in August – ‘was not the kind of experience needed to steady a sinking ship’.",
      "",
      "With complete deference and humility, of course.",
      "Solskjaer – along with Van Nistelrooy – was informed by Wilcox of the decision on Tuesday and, if an ESPN source is to be believed, “took the news like a gentleman”.",
      "The Athletic say Solskjaer was ‘naturally disappointed’ but remains ‘fully supportive of Carrick’. And even ‘carved out a few hours’ during the search ‘to go to the cinema and watch Marty Supreme’.",
      "That is pure, uncut Athletic inside story long read.",
      "",
      "In a word: no.",
      "But there were those within Manchester United who were left ‘suspecting’ that a concerted effort was being made ‘to push his name through the press and social media,’ in the words of The Athletic.",
      "They immediately clarify that there was no suggestion such a drive actually came from Solskjaer, who himself was ‘personally baffled by suggestions that he was keen to take the role before he had even been approached about it’.",
      "Solskjaer felt ‘he had the support of Wilcox and Berrada’ but less ‘backing from the club’s ownership’ in the Glazer family and Ratcliffe.",
      "Manchester United, for their part, ‘insist that at no point did anybody within the ownership challenge Wilcox’s recommendation to appoint Carrick,’ because why would you challenge a man who has just sacked his last recommendation after 14 months and hundreds of millions of pounds being spent?",
      "",
      "The current candidates range from unoriginal to unexciting and unlikely.",
      "It is fairly obvious that at some point Wilcox will stop “interfering” and simply take the reins himself.",
      "But who will inherit Carrick’s Manchester United and lead them into next season?",
      "There is a deeply Championship Manager-influenced belief that with this being a major international tournament year, the list of the best available managers will be further boosted in the summer once the World Cup is finished and every nation besides the winner has done away with their coach in a massive panic.",
      "It worked with Louis van Gaal so yeah, crack on.",

      "Unsurprisingly there is a vast torrent of guff to navigate in light of Michael Carrick’s appointment as Manchester United interim boss.",
      "Without giving too many spoilers away, we now live in a world where people are apparently surprised to discover mornings can be quite dark in northern England during January.",
      "Plus there’s all the usual transfer boosts and scaremongering and all such tishes and fipsies.",
      "",
      "Unusual for The Sun, usually a more calm and thoughtful voice in these troubled times, to claim this prize but they’ve smashed it out of the park here.",
      "The story? New Man United interim boss Michael Carrick gave his assistant Jonathan Woodgate a lift to Man United training this morning.",
      "The headline?",
      "DAWN RAID",
      "We spent longer than we care to admit desperately scouring those eight apparently wildly overexcited letters to try and find the cheeky bit of harmless wordplay concealed within and drew a blank.",
      "Luckily the standfirst was there to explain it for us, and to give away the fact that even The Sun knew it might be a bit much because they realised they needed to explain themselves.",
      "Michael Carrick gives Jonathan Woodgate a lift to training before dawn as he prepares for Man Utd baptism of fire against City.",
      "Surely there’s something crack/Carrick of dawn here. We can’t quite get there ourselves, but that’s not our job. It’s The Sun’s and they have let us down badly.",
      "",
      "The Sun are not the only ones leaning into this, though. Over at the Mail they are blown away entirely by the concept of anyone arriving for work in January ‘when it was still dark outside’.",
      "Michael Carrick is wasting no time getting down to business as Manchester United’s interim manager, with the club legend arriving to training while many are still asleep.",
      "Sunrise this morning in Manchester was at 8.17am. Arriving to work before that time is neither unusual nor noteworthy. Mediawatch is frankly jealous of the ‘many’ who are still asleep at that time.",
      "As ever, this feels like a story that fails the Mediawatch Test: would the opposite be more newsworthy? Carrick casually sauntering in for his first day with a coffee and an almond croissant at 10am would surely be more notable than arriving at the training ground, as the Mail so wonderfully put it, ‘just several hours’ after being appointed interim boss.",
      "And now we find ourselves entirely obsessed by just where exactly the cut-off exists for this. At what number of hours does the tabloid standard ‘just hours’ require the addition of a ‘several’ so as not to be too overtly taking the p*ss. And can you in fact even have ‘just several’ of anything? Is it not an oxymoron?",
      "It’s no life, this, is it?",

      "Man Utd news: Michael Carrick gets £20m transfer boost as move ‘100 per cent happening’",
      "We read the whole story to piece this together, so we trust you’re grateful.",
      "The ‘£20m transfer boost’ is itself clumsily welded together from two separate pieces of information: the first being The Guardian saying ‘transfer funds will be available’ and the second a Mirror story speculating that long-time United target Ruben Neves could be available this month for, you guessed it, 20 million of the King’s pounds.",
      "The move that is ‘100 per cent happening’ does, of course, have absolutely nothing to do with any of that. It is in fact the chances of Manuel Ugarte leaving United, according to a Turkish journalist.",
      "",
      "Adding up a list of players to get a scary final number has long been a staple of online football journalism, and the key was always not to worry at all about whether the players towards the bottom of your list of those who ‘could be SOLD’ or were ‘set to MISS’ some game or other were players who ever actually played games or contributed anything of value anyway. You could bundle in as many bomb-squadders and youth-teamers as your conscience would allow to get those numbers up, up, up.",
      "Which makes it slightly surprising that it’s only relatively recently that these outlets appear to have cottoned on to what now in hindsight seems the obvious fact that if you’re talking about players missing a match you can simply combine a scary big number from each club and come up with an even bigger and scarier number.",
      "Whichever content monkey came up with that deserves a raise.",
      "Anyway, it’s now entirely standard practice, and we’re delighted to report has led to zero reduction in deployment of the previous one-club dark arts.",
      "Take this one from the Mirror about tonight’s foaming pint of delicious Carabao.",
      "13 players who could miss Chelsea vs Arsenal Carabao Cup semi-final first leg",
      "Let’s get past the actual valid injury doubts on both sides. Boring. No interest in that genuine content. We want the p*ss-takes and the number-padders.",
      "There are bonus points straight away for turning it into a four-page photo gallery story, of course. Clicks ahoy! Further bonus points for managing to even find a picture of Dario Essugo in Chelsea action.",
      "Grudging acceptance that listing Arsenal first-team starters who ‘missed’ the Portsmouth game as continued ‘doubts’ for this one is very clever-stupid.",
      "But mainly just a round of applause for confirmation that Chelsea appointing Liam Rosenior as manager hasn’t magically ended Mykhaylo Mudryk’s ban.",
      "",
      "Another of Mediawatch’s favourite genre of headline here from the Mirror, in which the absolutely vital story-killing words have, by definitely real and necessary reasons of space, sadly had to be excised from the headline and left instead on the cutting-room floor, leading to the desperately unfortunate situation that nobody wanted where the headline is left looking like it might be atop an actual news story rather than just some guff.",

      "Man Utd legend Jaap Stam has outlined what the Red Devils should be looking for in their next permanent manager after sacking Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils ended Amorim’s time at Old Trafford last week after winning just three of his last 11 matches in charge of the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher was put in his place for two games before Michael Carrick was appointed as the Man Utd interim manager until the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils will then decide on a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with a number of top managers set to be available at the end of the campaign.",
      "When asked who Man Utd should be looking at as their long-term solution to their managerial woes, speaking on behalf of the Covers.com World Cup betting team, Stam said: “In modern football, tactics are very important. If you look at the Premier League, there are managers up and down the league who are technically strong. Manchester United need someone who has got the knowledge to make the team very difficult for the opposition, technically strong.",
      "“But you also need someone who is a man manager, who can get along with all the players, including the experienced squad members, not just the young ones.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "“A good manager will know how to use the younger players and then also have the ability to talk to experienced players, giving them both the same motivation to work hard for the club and to get everything out of themselves.”",
      "On whether the time was right for Amorim to leave Man Utd, Stam added: “There were discussions about Ruben Amorim’s future and his style of play for a long time, as Manchester United were not consistently getting results. He did better this season, and was getting the team closer to the European positions – he had the opportunity to take United back into the Champions League.",
      "“But how United have been playing in recent weeks is not good enough. The moment comes when the board have to make a decision about the manager, and if the level of performance didn’t change it was inevitable that Amorim would eventually be sacked, and that’s the decision that the board have made.”",
      "Stam also warned new interim boss Carrick that it’s a big step up for the former Middlesbrough manager, he said: “Other than his brief spell as caretaker manager, Michael Carrick hasn’t held such a position at a football club of Manchester United’s size for a long period of time. He’s only had proper experience on a full-time basis at Middlesborough in the Championship, which is completely different to the Premier League.",
      "“Hopefully, Carrick brings a positive impact to the club and guides them through the rest of the season. Finishing in a European place would go a long way given the current situation at Old Trafford, so only time will tell if he proves to be a good choice.",
      "“United need an interim manager who knows the club. Saying that, the club has changed over time; it’s different from when myself, Carrick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played. But you need someone who is familiar with the fans, a good coach and someone who has strong man-management skills.",
      "“For the remainder of the season, I believe the club’s hierarchy will have told Carrick what style of football they want to see, rather than give him free rein on formation and structure.”",
      "READ NEXT: Romano reveals the two managers ‘guaranteed’ a shot at the permanent Man Utd job",
      "The centre-back ‘covered’ under Amorim is not a good enough ‘athlete’ to thrive under Carrick and is set to be ‘exposed’ in his Man Utd system.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "There is, to nobody’s great surprise, a lot of nonsense about Michael Carrick’s first day in his new job as Manchester United interim manager.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "Michael Carrick has the platform to finally realise his Newcastle ‘dream’, while his eventual and ultimate replacement at Manchester United is clear.",
      "Manchester United appointing Michael Carrick is making nobody giddy while the VAR call on Tuesday night was a disgrace."

He could go anywhere in the world.”",
      "He added: “It is a difficult club to go to, and certainly he won’t find the harmony, the happiness, and the names and people that works around him. He’ll have much more money at Manchester United, but the structure is not right for him, I don’t think. But in any case, there’s no argument. He has plans for Aston Villa.”",

      "Xabi Alonso has left Real Madrid, because they take the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia very seriously indeed.",
      "Obviously, that wasn’t the only reason he’s gone, even if as a camel back-breaker it does seem a particularly small and twatty straw.",
      "But it instantly catapults him to the top of speculative and concrete managerial wishlists for the great, good and batsh*t of world football. By law, all reports about Alonso must from now until confirmation of his next appointment include the phrase ‘no shortage of suitors’.",
      "But where exactly will he end up? Let us rank the options from hilarious to distinctly possible, based on the early noise being generated about those aforementioned suitors.",
      "",
      "We have very much enjoyed the tone around Manchester United being interested in a man who managed to win the Bundesliga title with a team that is not Bayern Munich. It’s a reminder that for so, so many of us who had our childhoods ruined by Fergie and the lads that Man United remain an outsized deal even in a world that has left them behind.",
      "This is still, somehow, in the eyes of Gen Xers and Millennials, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And so all the early reports are about how United will graciously deign to consider appointing him, rather than the other way around. It is absolutely unthinkable that Alonso won’t have better offers than a job literally nobody has been able to do for what is now close on 15 years, but it’s all still framed like United are doing him a favour by sparing some of their own bandwidth to consider the idea.",
      "Also it won’t happen because we all know deep in our bones that Man United will not actually be appointing a new manager in the summer. They will give the permanent job to Michael Carrick. But we must all dance the dance until United, yet again, confuse themselves into the shadow realm at the sight of a beloved former player performing competently in an interim capacity.",
      "By the time they realise they’ve made a terrible mistake, someone else will already have snaffled Alonso. And then Jason Wilcox will appoint himself.",
      "",
      "Very much the funniest possibility, as is usually the case wherever Bumblef*ck Hotspur FC are involved. If Spurs end up with Xabi Alonso as their manager, then it will be the most spectacular opportunity yet to deploy the Little Britain ‘I fell’ meme from that time when Andy somehow ends up at the top of a tree.",
      "The genius of both Spurs and Alonso’s situation is that the idea is obviously and objectively laughable, but both their respective situations means you can just about talk yourself into imagining a dimension where it is halfway feasible. And that crumb of feasibility, that tiny minuscule link back to actual reality, is key to what makes it so funny.",
      "We can all enjoy entirely abstract absurdity, but even the tiniest grounding in reality is vital to really great comedy.",
      "And the fact is that a manager who succeeds spectacularly at a club like Bayer Leverkusen but falls on his arse at a club like Real Madrid is precisely the right profile of manager for a club like Spurs. A very big club that, try as it might, will never truly be an elite one.",
      "The Real Madrid mess might just mean Alonso has to take some medicine over his next job. It is not entirely impossible that he might have to do a little bit more overachieving before he can have another crack at regular superclub achieving.",
      "And we will laugh our c*cks clean off if it happens. Which, again, it almost certainly won’t. But almost certainly isn’t certainly.",
      "",
      "Does feel early for Alonso to skive off to international management, but would you entirely rule it out if the World Cup goes either brilliantly or terribly?",
      "Given the first two options we’ve already got past, it certainly won’t be the least appealing potential option out there for a man with 114 caps and World Cup and European winners’ medals with La Roja.",
      "No disputing the fact Spain must be a tremendously fun squad of footballers to manage, one that are matched possibly by only France in avoiding the usual problem of international management for elite club bosses where you suddenly don’t just automatically get world-class players in every position.",
      "One other thing to consider is that this is Spain and, while currently apparently settled and happy, one can never entirely rule out a great big explosive meltdown and managerial banishment just before a major tournament. So it’s not entirely out of the question for this opportunity to come up before the World Cup.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool connections that make the red half of Manchester slightly problematic are less pronounced with City, and if anything it feels more rather than less feasible for this job to be actually available in the summer.",
      "It’s definitely possible that Pep Guardiola decides he’s had quite enough of all this after what now looks like a second consecutive failure to mount a sustained challenge for a title that was for many years his confirmed personal property.",
      "There really isn’t much left for Guardiola to achieve or prove at City if he can’t muster the energy to complete a full rebuild of a new dominant team from the current foothills.",
      "Maybe it is time for someone new to have a go at replicating Guardiola’s success. Make it a proper fresh start.",
      "Having failed at Madrid, taking on the formidable challenge of being Guardiola’s direct replacement at City comes with palpable risk for Alonso’s still currently very much intact reputation, but hard to imagine he wouldn’t be up for that particular challenge/risk.",
      "",
      "Played for them with great distinction, became their scourge as Leverkusen manager, and nobody would be at all surprised to see him rock up in Munich again as manager somewhere along the line.",
      "The only real wrinkle here is that they already have a manager and he’s doing very nicely, thank you. Vincent Kompany as, has was always predicted, trod that familiar path from Burnley to Munich with great aplomb and has Bayern on course for further success in his second season at the club.",
      "But also very much worth considering here that the words ‘second season’ should not be used too airily where Bayern are concerned. Two years is very much at the top end of the shelf life for any Bayern Munich manager.",
      "The last manager to go beyond that was Pep Guardiola, who managed three seasons. His immediate predecessor Jupp Heynckes managed exactly two full seasons. Before that you have to go back to Felix Magath’s two-and-a-half years in charge between July 2004 and January 2007 for the last Bayern manager to beat the two-year mark.",
      "Kompany is already barely a month shy of becoming the longest-serving manager among Bayern’s last seven permanent appointments. So, Alonso to Bayern this year is a lot more possible than might seem at first glance to be the case, is what we’re saying here.",
      "",
      "Obviously. There’s no great trick to putting Alonso’s former clubs right at the top of the list here but sometimes you don’t need to try and be clever. This is a man who has the rare distinction of having played for three legitimate giants in three of European football’s powerhouse countries.",
      "He’s already had a go at managing one of the three and, fair play, it all went to sh*t. But that’s absolutely not going to put off either of the others and probably nor should it.",
      "It feels absolutely certain that Alonso will manage both Bayern and Liverpool at some point down the line.",
      "What’s trickier is how near or far down the line. The Liverpool job is, in theory, as currently unavailable as the Bayern one.",
      "But there have also been plenty of whispers and nudges about the safety and security of Arne Slot’s position even before Alonso became the suddenly available and devilishly handsome elephant in the room.",
      "If Liverpool really do harbour doubts about Slot despite his 24/25 successes, and there are credible reasons this season why they should, then Alonso’s availability becomes another push factor.",
      "Were the manager’s job at Liverpool suddenly to become vacant, it’s easy to see how they and Alonso instantly become each other’s top choices.",
      "William Saliba is sick and ‘tired’ of having ‘nothing in my pockets’, with the Frenchman among nine Arsenal and Manchester City players eyeing a Quadruple.",
      "Chelsea have an ‘immature bunch’ of players and that showed v Arsenal, who might well be on for the Quad.",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…",
      "Real Madrid superstar Jude Bellingham has slammed reports claiming he did not like Xabi Alonso, calling out journalists and their ‘damaging misinformation’.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",

      "You might remember Svilar as the young goalkeeper who scored an own goal for Benfica against Manchester United in the Champions League back in 2017.",
      "Despite that error, there was huge belief that the Serbian would become a top goalkeeper, and he has done just that.",
      "He spent five years at Benfica before joining Roma on a free transfer in 2022 and has gone on to make 112 appearances for the Serie A club.",

      "According to Asromalive.it, Svilar is valued at €70million (£60m) after signing a new five-year contract last summer, but that fee ‘wouldn’t scare English clubs’.",

      "He helped bring about the demise of Amorim with his self-confessed problem of always wanting to “interfere in what the managers are doing” for he is “a coach at heart”.",

There is nothing wrong with that, but that’s all they are. It is common knowledge that spending a 100m on a player that has just 1 good season behind him would be a fool’s errand. So why are these one season managers being given some of the world’s top jobs left right and center?",
      "You can take your pick of these one season wonder managers, from Amorim, Ten Hag, Nagelsmann, Alonso and to an extent Slot. Winning a league is a great thing no matter what, but to win it once, and to win it consistently over time, across teams and leagues, is another. and there is a very very wide gap in the talent required to do the former vs the latter.",

That does not mean that they will not be a top manager in the future, but the fact that blindly backing these managers is not the sensible thing to do for most top clubs.",
      "You are better off finding your own gem in the dirt ala Barce with Pep or Madrid with Zidane or maybe Arsenal with Arteta if he wins the league, or hiring managers who have consistently proven that they are World Class like Ancelotti, Tuchel, Flick, Klopp, Enrique & more who have won titles across years, multiple cups & showcased their ability across a time period to prove it wasn’t a one off event. It’s the same way you’d rather find your own Harry Kane from the academy or go on and buy a Suarez, Lewandowski etc. Players who have shown consistency in their ability to be world class.",

      "As far as United go in terms of meeting the standards of its best years – as well as of a club that spends as much as it does on players – it’s bad. But at the end of the day this ultimately all about 22 players chasing a leather/pig skin/synthetic orb around a field. It should never be at the point of A) fans abusing players/managers/officials and B) an entire industry made up of (often contradictory) articles decrying where everyone is going wrong. In United’s case at least, B) often contains elements of A) (see Nicholson calling everyone at United a “dunderheed”).",
      "Let’s take a look at those “dunderheeds”.",
      "Now I grant you, Ratcliffe is probably not best placed to run a sporting club, let alone one the size of United. But are we calling a self made billionaire stupid? There are many things you could say about him fairly in describing his approach to business, politics and humanity, but stupid is not one of them.",
      "And then Berrada has definitely made mistakes – keeping Ten Hag and then pushing for Amorim notably – but he’s had a distinguished career at Barcelona and Manchester City before coming to United.",
      "On the business side United were supposed to be reducing costs to make the club more profitable after years of mismanagement by Ed Woodward. This has been a painful process but wages are down and losses have been reduced dramatically. If you thought United were suddenly going to start making massive profits immediately then you were foolish. The trajectory is a good one though we really need someone to put their hands in their pockets and pay that debt off.",
      "Credit to Ratcliffe where it’s due on that point as he in fact did put £300M of his own money into the club. The person to do so that I can remember (other than the fans who have been rinsed over the years). Lots of negatives too but were they unpopular decisions or were they mistakes? There’s a business case for making staff redundant and raising ticket prices as difficult as those things are to stomach. Should they have focused on staff redundancies whilst sacking managers and spending a fortune on players?",
      "Sacking managers costs money but the cost in and of itself doesn’t affect the profitably of the organisation as much as underlying staff costs. And when the managers have you playing terrible football what does that do for profitability?",
      "The bigger questions are on the football side. What exactly was the deal with the Ashworth pursuit and eventual sacking? I could have told you he wasn’t worth pursuing in the first place but at least United can be said to have failed fast here. I would question why he was replaced by Wilcox and not a world class proven Sporting Director. That said, I’m not sure what Wilcox has done wrong so far – aside from not signing a midfielder in the summer, though United were short of goals and that seems to have been addressed.",
      "I think recruitment has been generally good – younger players (Dorgu, Sesko, Lammens) or those approaching their peak and proven in Our League (Mbeumo, Cunha). Players moved on when they’ve needed to be (no one wants Malacia it seems). Going for Lammens over Martinez was a brave call but a smart one in the long term and with United’s constraints I think. This all seems to be a significant improvement behind the scenes on what came before.",
      "Question marks on some of the haggling over Mbeumo – should we have pivoted to Semenyo? – whether Sesko will come good and why we didn’t sign a midfielder, but no club comes out of a transfer window without question marks (see Liverpool) and a squad as badly constructed as United’s will take years to rebuild.",
      "I think Wilcox has been wrongly blamed for hiring Amorim in the first place and for some reason the Sporting Director can’t suggest changes to the head coach even though literally everyone questioned why Amorim when back to 3 at the back for the Wolves game after beating Newcastle with 4 at the back. But then what do I know? I’ve never been a Sporting Director. And neither has anyone at F365. When Monchi or Begiristain comes out with their own F365 Says pieces about every mistake Wilcox has made I’ll sit up and take notice. Until that point he probably doesn’t deserve to be known as a “dunderheed”.",
      "And on a final point, I’ve been really disappointed that Shea Lacey’s sending off has been used all over the place to somehow encapsulate United’s entire plight. Even Nicholson referenced it, though indirectly. This guy’s is EIGHTEEN. He doesn’t deserve any abuse from anyone for anything that he does on the football pitch. Was he a bit silly? Yes. But do you know what? He bounced a ball into the ground metres from anyone in the 91st minute of an FA Cup tie. This wasn’t a seasoned professional, it was an over exuberant young man who’d spent the last twenty minutes showing his peers exactly how football should be done. Ref could’ve been a bit less exuberant himself.",
      "Maybe we should think about whether it wasn’t Shea Lacey that was a bit silly but the rules themselves or even the game itself. I suggest we all have a think about whether it is in fact us that are all rather silly for putting so much weight on the actions of 22 much younger men chasing a ball around a pitch and those that profit from it.",
      "My point? In a world of Trump, climate catastrophe and pending AI apocalypse, isn’t this all a bit silly? Isn’t our anger best directed somewhere other than at people that kick a ball around or arrange said kickabouts? The problem is not necessarily those running and playing football but us for being so easily distracted – and too eager to be distracted from – the important things.",

      "Burnley scored a freak deflection and finished with 2 goals from their 1 shot on target. Meanwhile we absolutely battered them and looked very good in attack (indeed, we scored the winning goal). Against Brighton, we kept them to 2 shots on target until late game, but unfortunately they scored both, while we had 19 chances and 8 on target but unfortunately two of the best fell to Dalot. Bad result, but we still looked the better team overall, the negative chat mostly comes from frustration.",
      "Mainoo, meanwhile, putting in decent numbers for his role – only Bruno created more chances than him against Brighton, while his passing was mostly on point, only a couple of missed passes across two games (in spite of the baseless narrative that he couldn’t pass).",
      "The core issue remains, as it has been for years, with players like Dalot and Casemiro, while Mount completely doesn’t suit this set up and Cunha is looking like the one season wonder I feared he might be at the beginning of the season. Thankfully, Mazraoui is back soon, along with Amad and Mbeumo who have been our best two.",
      "Maybe I’m weird like that, but I don’t think a week under a guy in his first temporary senior management gig is long enough to judge, especially when people have spent the last 14 months doing brilliant mental gymnastics to defend the terrible. I don’t know if it’s a factor, but I have previously expressed concern around telling players that the guy they’re working under won’t be around long.",

      "After spending a week searching for a suitable club legend to replace Ruben Amorim until the summer, INEOS have landed on Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Carrick is probably the more sensible, albeit boring, option out of the two, with three factors said to be in his favour over the manager he previously assisted at Man Utd.",
      "And now that the Red Devils have a new interim boss until the summer, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team cannot afford not to get the permanent appointment right if they want any hope of ‘Mission 21’ coming to fruition.",
      "So, as tempting as it may be to appoint Carrick permanently if he guides Man Utd to Champions League qualification, INEOS must not fall into this trap again after the previous mistakes made with Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Instead, a high-level manager is required to sort out the mess at Old Trafford, and several credible candidates are already in the frame.",
      "READ: Premier League manager rankings: where do Amorim and Maresca land in list of all 28(!) managers?",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner did himself no favours in the FA Cup at the weekend, but this is a rare blot on his résumé, and he had been earmarked as an early frontrunner to be Man Utd’s next permanent boss.",
      "However, the latest reports have indicated that PSG boss Luis Enrique has risen to the top of the list as Man Utd’s ‘main target’ among four options, with Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino also mentioned.",
      "Enrique is one of the very few elite managers currently in football, and it would be wonderful for the Premier League to have him in England, especially with it likely that Pep Guardiola’s time at Manchester City is close to an end.",
      "There have been murmurs about Enrique leaving Champions League holders Paris-Saint Germain in the summer, but this does not necessarily mean he will end up at Man Utd, with Liverpool and Man City far more likely if their managers’ jobs were to become available in the near future.",
      "But if logic was thrown out of the window and Enrique does join Man Utd, how would their team look next season?",
      "Well, it would look very different based on formation alone, as Enrique is renowned for his fluid 4-3-3 formation and this could be used to good effect by Man Utd, provided there are some notable purchases in the summer.",
      "Starting with the goalkeeper, summer signing Senne Lammens picks himself after slotting in seamlessly following his move from Royal Antwerp. This department was a major problem position last season, so it says a lot about how well the 23-year-old has performed that it is now a non-topic.",
      "Man Utd, unlike in midfield and up front, are also pretty strong in defence as they have an array of options, with Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu currently standout candidates to start at right-back and left-back should they revert to a back four.",
      "Dalot looks far more at home at full-back than wing-back as he was one of Man Utd’s most consistent performers before Amorim changed the system, while Dorgu, despite still being quite raw, has shown signs of promise and could be excellent if he can hone his craft under a brilliant coach.",
      "At centre-back, Enrique would likely favour Leny Yoro alongside Matthijs de Ligt as they provide a nice blend of being dependable defenders that can also cope with having the ball at their feet.",
      "The most significant changes would come in midfield, which is inevitable regardless of whether Enrique takes charge or not.",
      "It is being widely reported that the Red Devils will prioritise landing two new midfielders in the summer, with these signings likely to fill the void left by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Amorim is said to be the reason why Fernandes stuck around in the summer, and without the head coach around, INEOS can take one of their last chances to cash in on their club captain for a sizable fee to raise funds for a rebuild. Casemiro, meanwhile, needs to be eased out of the picture for a long-term replacement, even if he accepts a large pay cut to stick around for another year.",
      "In this case, the dream scenario for Man Utd would be the signings of Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton to replace Fernandes and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba to replace Casemiro.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "Wharton, who could reportedly be bought for a reasonable fee of £65m by a Champions League club in the summer, and Baleba, who is still likely to cost around £100m following United’s failed move last year, could operate alongside Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "England international Mainoo is the big winner of Amorim’s sacking, and this is going to be a big year for the centre-midfielder, with the appointment of Enrique (or an alternative of a similar calibre) enough to help Man Utd with their campaign to land Wharton and Baleba.",
      "In attack, Benjamin Sesko is Man Utd’s current striker project, so he would remain as their No.9 under Enrique and potentially be supported on either flank by Bryan Mbeumo and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Matheus Cunha is an option to cover multiple positions, but Mbeumo and Rashford are more natural fits for the wide roles in Enrique’s formation.",
      "Mbeumo is already a vital player for Man Utd, and while Rashford has proved his worth at Barcelona, their lingering financial problems hinder a deal, and he’ll definitely be more open to a return to Old Trafford without Amorim and with Enrique takes charge.",

      "United opted to appoint an interim for the remainder of 2025/26 after sacking Ruben Amorim at the beginning of January, with a view to bringing in an elite manager permanently in the summer.",

      "The 44-year-old’s sole objective is to get the Red Devils back into the Champions League, with fifth place in the Premier League expected to be enough. United are currently seventh.",
      "There is a decent chance the former United midfielder, who oversaw three games as caretaker boss following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s sacking in November 2021, will have money to spend this month, with a midfielder a top priority.",

      "However, according to a report from Hooligan Soccer, via a ‘team of five elite reporters’ on X, Carrick’s ‘first transfer request’ is West Ham playmaker Lucas Paqueta.",
      "It has been reported that Paqueta wants to return to Brazil, with Flamengo willing to pay around £30million for the 28-year-old.",
      "Paqueta is said to be so keen on leaving West Ham that he has reportedly agreed personal terms with Flamengo and accepted a pay cut.",

      "Carrick is reportedly ‘looking to expand his player pool’ and has ‘asked’ the United hierarchy to sign Paqueta from West Ham.",
      "The former Middlesbrough head coach is not expected to have much influence over transfers. No United manager will. An interim certainly will not.",
      "Instead, director of football Jason Wilcox is expected to have the final say on all incoming transfers.",
      "Paqueta was previously linked with a move to Manchester City, but an FA investigation into suspicious betting patterns derailed that transfer and has clearly affected the former Lyon star on a personal level.",
      "A fresh start back home appears to be the perfect solution for Paqueta, rather than stepping into the current chaos at Old Trafford.",
      "That said, the prospect of playing for the biggest club in England could yet tempt him to remain in the Premier League.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League manager rankings: where do Amorim and Maresca land in list of all 28(!) managers?",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as clubs up and down the Premier League try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal rank as the most effective side, with Liverpool the least, but what are they doing differently?",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Thursday 15 January 2026 08:55, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "By using inswingingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "But there is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",

      "By Rob Dorsett & Danyal Khan",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have gone with Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season, as Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan break down why the club's hierarchy and Jason Wilcox landed on the appointment...",
      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

      "Sunday 11 January 2026 19:59, UK",
      "Manchester United's problems continued to build after Brighton secured their place in the FA Cup fourth round with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Brajan Gruda (12) and Danny Welbeck (64) condemned United to defeat in what could well prove to be interim boss Darren Fletcher's final match before an appointment is made for the rest of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the frontrunners for a post.",
      "Defeat to Brighton sees United, who were given a late lifeline by Benjamin Sesko (85) before Shea Lacey was shown a red card (89) for two quick-fire bookings, knocked out both the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle of the competitions for the first time since the 1981/82 season, leaving them with just the Premier League to focus on as they look to qualify for Europe.",
      "The full-time whistle was greeted with boos before near silence ensued with the Man Utd supporters and players left stunned by yet another lacklustre performance. The loss means United will play just 40 games this season - their lowest since the 2014/15 campaign when they played 44 games, and Fletcher said that the fans had every right to show their displeasure.",
      "Whoever takes over will have to deal with mounting problems at Old Trafford, where there was a banner criticising the running of the club by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. There were also chants United fans are also chanting: 'We Want the Glazers Out.'",

      "Meanwhile, Brighton's fantastic recent record continues against United. Fabian Hurzeler's side beat United for the first time in the FA Cup. They now have seven wins in nine games against United and four victories in five visits to Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher was given a warm welcome by Old Trafford as he emerged from the tunnel and his side started well, with a pair of early Jason Steele saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes keeping Brighton in the contest.",
      "Brighton had been eliminated by United in the six previous FA Cup ties between them, but they were sent on their way to ending that hoodoo when Gruda reacted quickest to lash home the rebound after Georginio Rutter's header was cleared off the line.",
      "Fletcher attempted to gee up the crowd when he returned, but there was little to cheer during a disappointingly slow start to the second period. Lacey and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced in a bid to change the dynamics, but just moments later Brighton extended their lead.",
      "Welbeck received a pass from Gruda and was all too easily able to take a touch and slam a 65th-minute shot into the top left-hand corner.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the message from the United fans as they urged their side to get back into the game. Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",
      "\"You can see that the players are fragile and they need to build themselves up. It's up to them now, they've got to respond.",
      "\"Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football and when you don't have it, you have to dig deep, you have to win, battle, fight, grind, work, win games and then the confidence comes back.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Eddie Howe to succeed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as Gary Neville tells the hierarchy to \"remove the risks\" while citing Thomas Tuchel as the perfect appointment.",

      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",

      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Burnley did not have a shot on target in the first half but they did not need one to lead at the break, Bashir Humphreys' cross deflected beyond Senne Lammens after taking a wicked deflection off the unfortunate Ayden Heaven that saw the ball loop into the net.",
      "United, playing in a 4-2-3-1 formation, had ample opportunities to level it up before the interval but Sesko had a hat-trick of chances saved by Martin Dubravka. Humphreys and Maxime Esteve cleared efforts off the line. Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed.",
      "Fletcher switched Matheus Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at the interval, the change reaping dividends with the skipper threaded a pass through for Sesko to finish emphatically. The Slovenian then converted Patrick Dorgu's cross for a second goal.",
      "Credit to Burnley for finding a response thanks to Anthony, the substitute cutting in on his left foot and firing an unstoppable shot high beyond Lammens. United youngster Shea Lacey almost responded in kind but saw his effort come back off the bar.",
      "Instead, it is a third straight draw for United - against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley. Fletcher was serenaded by the away support, nevertheless, as Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada looked on. A time of change off the pitch but another tough result on it.",
      "Man Utd interim head coach Darren Fletcher on Benjamin Sesko:",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs.",
      "\"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well. And like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, you hit the back of the net, it builds your confidence and hopefully it starts flowing for him from there.",
      "\"Everyone can see his qualities, I thought he was fantastic tonight, he led the line really well and maybe he could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive for the night really, his two goals, and hopefully that's good for Manchester United's future.\"",
      "\"The positive is Sesko scoring. Hopefully he gets some confidence. It's taken him six months to turn up but I'm pleased for him.",
      "\"He's had a tough run and I'd have had him off the pitch at half-time, never to wear a Manchester United shirt again. I stand by what I said, he's not good enough to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"He's turned up for one game against Burnley who are going to get relegated. Hopefully we start seeing something different from him.\"",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker speaking in the press conference:",
      "\"Everything I demanded of the team and the team demanded of themselves was there. I wanted a reaction. We were bitterly disappointed by the overall performance and what we produced at Brighton. This was getting back to what we need to bring to a Premier League game of football.",
      "\"We started the game really well and to go 2-1 down, we needed a reaction and we produced that. It was an improvement for us as a team and overall a massive point for us and more importantly the character of the team in adversity, they stood up and got a result. It is definitely a stepping stone.\"",
