      "Manchester United have made an opening offer for Bryan Mbeumo worth £55million, though it is likely to be rejected by Brentford, who value their star forward in excess of £60m.",
      "Mbeumo, 25 has emerged as a priority target for the Red Devils after they rubber-stamped a deal for Matheus Cunha earlier this week. There is, however, no agreement with Brentford yet over the versatile forward, who has indicated a preference to join United.",
      "After approaching Brentford for club to club talks, United have tabled a proposal worth £55m including add-ons - but that bid is expected to be rebuked.",
      "As outlined by The Athletic, the initial fee on offer is £45m with a further £10m in add-ons. That package is some way below what Brentford would expect for a player who broke the 20-goal barrier in the Premier League last season.",
      "United are expected to negotiate with their domestic rivals on a price for the Cameroon star as they press ahead with plans to bolster Ruben Amorim's attacking options.",
      "Despite the fact that Mbeumo is in the final year of his contract, Brentford hold a one year option to extend said deal and, as such, are under no pressure to sell.",
      "While Mbeumo is keen on a move to Old Trafford, United's pursuit of a player who is capable of playing both out wide and through the middle could be complicated by interest in Yoane Wissa from clubs in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Brentford are not be willing to lose Mbeumo and Wissa this summer, meaning United may have to act fast in order to prevent missing out on a key target.",
      "United are desperate for more firepower after ending the 2024-25 campaign with just 44 league goals to their name; the second lowest in the league outside of the three relegated teams.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has urged the club not to sell Kobbie Mainoo, warning them that it would be 'a step too far'. Mainoo, 20, broke into United's first-team under former boss Erik ten Hag and enjoyed a meteoric rise during the 2023-24 season.",
      "The midfielder scored as Ten Hag's side beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup and he became a starter for England later that summer, helping the Three Lions reach the final of Euro 2024. But his progress has stalled this term.",
      "Fitness problems and a change of formation under new manager Ruben Amorim have limited Mainoo's opportunities. The United academy graduate was benched for the Europa League final and Amorim only gave him a brief cameo in stoppage time.",
      "His lack of minutes plus the Red Devils' decision to put every player up for sale this summer has left Mainoo's future shrouded in uncertainty. Neville, like many supporters, would be gutted to see the Stockport-born starlet leave.",
      "\"Mainoo, no. That's a step too far,\" Neville declared on the It's Called Soccer podcast. \"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him.",
      "\"Why can't we make him a top player? If he's one of ours and he's shown talent. I don't know what's gone on there in the last few months. He's obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I'd like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro as his partner and it's probably not [Manuel] Ugarte as his partner, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I'm being honest. But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he's come through the ranks.",
      "\"I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do. Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, [Alejandro] Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",
      "Amorim has already assured Neville that he doesn't want to lose Mainoo, who was tipped to join Premier League rivals Chelsea in January. It came amid reports that the 20-year-old's representatives were demanding wages in the region of £150,000 per week.",
      "\"I really love my players,\" Amorim said. \"I want to keep them, especially the talented ones. It is a hard moment and I am really happy with Kobbie. He is improving.\""

      "Manchester United have wasted little time getting stuck into the summer transfer window as Ruben Amorim bids to urgently overhaul his struggling squad. Amorim could only guide United to a 15th place finish in the Premier League, comfortably their worst campaign since the division's inception in 1992.",
      "He will be eager to secure more firepower for his frontline after watching Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggle for confidence up front, scoring just seven goals combined in the 2024-25 Premier League season.",
      "Amorim has already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves through the door and is aiming to complete a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo in the coming days too.",
      "There are a number of players whose future look uncertain - such as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, and Amorim will be hoping he can get rid of his deadwood to top up his transfer budget for the summer.",
      "United have a number of talented young players in their academy and one of the brightest stars in 19-year-old midfielder Sekou Kone, who arrived for around £1million last summer.",
      "Kone has been thrown straight into the mix for the club's Under-21 side, playing nine times in Premier League 2 and he's even been named on the bench three times for Amorim's first team.",
      "He was involved in the squad that flew out to Asia for their post-season tour and came on twice as a substitute, but the club want him to pick up more minutes to get him up to scratch fitness wise.",
      "Earlier this year, United Under-21 boss Travis Binnion said it was clear Kone was a massive talent, but that he needed more time before he was ready to compete for a spot in Amorim's team.",
      "Of all the players Amorim is willing to let go of this summer, it's unlikely centre-back Lisandro Martinez will be one of them.",
      "The Argentine defender is currently recovering from a long-term ACL injury and is hoping to return by September.",
      "Martinez managed 20 starts in the Premier League, scoring twice, but couldn't stop United's slide down the table. He is now said to be of interest to Serie A side Napoli, who have just won the Serie A under Antonio Conte.",
      "Napoli would be able to offer Martinez Champions League football this season, but according to the Daily Mail the 27-year-old is not interested in the move.",
      "The report claims Martinez is \"determined\" to stay and succeed at Old Trafford, even if he is handed more opportunities to play in Europe's elite competition this summer.",
      "It says Napoli had been exploring opportunities to find bargain deals and were hoping to take advantage of United's willingness to sell players.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been linked with Manchester United ever since Amorim arrived at Old Trafford after his incredible goalscoring exploits for Sporting Lisbon.",
      "There is no doubt that Gyokeres would dramatically change the club's fortunes after he smashed in 53 goals in all competitions, the highest total of any striker in Europe's top leagues.",
      "His performances have led to a string of clubs competing for his signature, with Arsenal and United said to be the leading contenders.",
      "However, the Red Devils may have hurt their chances of signing the player after failing to qualify for the Champions League - or any European competition whatsoever - handing the advantage to Arsenal.",

      "The former Coventry striker told Vogue Scandinavia, via A Bola: \"In Swedish culture, people work hard during the week and if they want to do something, they do it on the weekend,\" Gyokeres revealed to Vogue Scandinavia via Portuguese outlet A Bola.",
      "\"Here, people also make the most of the weekdays. They come over with friends on Monday or any other day of the week, have dinner and a glass of wine.",

      "But it appears increasingly likely that he will leave the Second City this summer. Villa's failure to qualify for the Champions League means that a big sale will be needed to comply with Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "Martinez appears to be a prime candidate to move on, with Villa eyeing a move for Espanyol's Joan Garcia. The Argentine has been heavily linked with a transfer to a Saudi Arabia club.",
      "But his standing as one of the Premier League's top keepers will also attract the interest of big teams in Europe. United look to be one of them amid Onana's awful form in the season just gone.",
      "The Cameroonian kept just nine clean sheets in his 38 Premier League appearances, conceding 44 goals in the top-flight as the Red Devils finished 15th. According to TyC Sports, United chiefs have identified Martinez as a prime option.",
      "While he has no offers on the table, the Red Devils are said to be interested. It is claimed that United chiefs first contacted Martinez six months ago and have been discussing a move for him for 'weeks'.",
      "Any move will only take place if Onana departs, with United ready to go 'all out' for Martinez. While the speculation around his future grows louder, Martinez is currently with Argentina ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Colombia.",

      "\"3rd consecutive European football. Not what we wanted but that shows how far we have come as a club. The fans were amazing as always, thank you! It’s been a long and hard season but working with people you love is always easier,\" Martinez posted on Instagram.",
      "Villa boss Unai Emery meanwhile has hinted that Martinez will be on his way this summer. The Spaniard refused to confirm that the Argentine would be staying in the Midlands.",
      "He said: \"We will see. Of course, it is the last match here [this season], and I don't know. We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field. Of course, then we will see about everything, how we are going to try to get better for the next season.\""

      "The west Londoners won the Europa Conference League and got into the top five with a win on the final day. United meanwhile failed to qualify for any European tournament, which may have proved defining when Delap decided on his next move.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 12 times in the Premier League - including one in the shock win over Chelsea midway through the season - and was shortlisted for the Young Player of the Year award. Delap made it clear that he felt that Chelsea were firmly a side on the up as they continue to invest in new talent and believes Stamford Bridge is the best place for him to his own personal development.",

The hunger and desire to keep adding trophies, to take the club back to where it belongs, that is the main objective.\"",

He had previously stood down as team principal of Ineos Grenadiers when Ratcliffe purchased his stake in United and took charge of football operations. Brailsford was initially crucial to the change the new owners wanted to implement.",

Brailsford is due to aid the Ineos Grenadiers management team of John Allert, the chief executive, and performance director Scott Drawer.",
      "Ratcliffe has remained committed to his cycling projects despite majorly cutting back in some of his other investments. Sponsorship of the All Blacks has ended and the British billionaire has also called time on his pursuit of the America's Cup.",

      "Having been at Middlesbrough for only a few months shy of three years, there is an argument that says Carrick has been given plenty of time. But remember Middlesbrough’s predicament when Carrick took over in October, 2022.",
      "They had 17 points from 16 games and were a point above the relegation zone. Carrick’s impact and influence would see Middlesbrough finish fourth that season before losing to Coventry City in the play-offs.",

      "The stark truth is that tenth place was a disappointment. There were mitigating circumstances, not least the injury to on-loan Liverpool winger Ben Doak and the sale of top scorer Emmanuel Latte Lath in the winter window.",
      "Gibson, though, did back Carrick but certain recruitment decisions did not work out as well as might have been expected.

(Don’t forget, in his caretaker spell at Old Trafford, he won two, drew one and lost none.)",
      "As a player, Carrick’s tally of 34 England caps was under-representative of his talent but he is exactly the sort of English coach who the Football Association should be monitoring.",

      "Hale End graduate Cole began his Gunners career in 1999 when he made his full debut, and would go on to establish himself under Arsene Wenger as one of the Premier League's finest full-backs. The Englishman won two league titles in north London as well as three FA Cup trophies, and was pivotal in the club's famous 2003/04 Invincibles campaign.",
      "While Cole, who played over 200 times for Arsenal, saw his Gunners legacy somewhat tarnished in 2006 when he joined bitter rivals Chelsea in an acrimonious switch, Henry believes he still doesn't get the recognition he deserves as one of English football's finest ever left-backs. Though Red Devils legend Keane slightly disagrees.",
      "\"There is a guy that I want to talk about, who I don't understand why in this country he doesn't get his respect: Ashley Cole,\" Henry stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Ashley Cole was outstanding.",
      "\"Firstly, in 2000, Ashley went to Crystal Palace on loan, and he saved them from relegation, playing as a winger. When you have a left-back that can dribble past their winger, he was the one who created space for the rest of the team at Arsenal. He started everything.",
      "\"For me, Ashley Cole is the best left-back I have ever seen. Me. I'm not talking about everybody. Ashley Cole… Going forward, defending, the desire, what he won and why he won it.\"",
      "While Henry sang the praises of his former team-mate, who he played alongside a staggering 195 times in the red of Arsenal, Keane then chimed in. \"I think he was a brilliant player, but when you talk about great left-backs, he doesn't spring to my mind,\" quipped Keane. \"Of course, he was a brilliant player.\"",
      "Henry rebuked Keane's claim and went on to discuss Cole's controversial and bad-blooded move from the north of London to the west, explaining he feels it is why the left-back isn't quite held in the regard he deserves. He continued: \"Ashley Cole is an Arsenal man.",
      "\"His whole family supports Arsenal. But I can understand why he left at the time. In 2005, David Dein shook hands on a deal, but he came back with something else.",

Amorim used a similar tactic against Hong Kong to stagger his game time, bringing him on in the 27th minute before subbing him again at the interval, with Manuel Ugarte replacing him.",

The 25-year-old forward is poised to move in the summer transfer window after enjoying a stand-out season that has thrust him into the spotlight.",
      "Mbeumo racked up 20 goals and eight assists in 38 Premier League matches for Brentford this season and was one of the league’s stand-out players. He has been linked with Newcastle, Liverpool and Tottenham, but it is Manchester United who are understood to be the most keen on the £50million-rated forward.",
      "The Bees star is keen to play European football – a factor that could count against United – after working his way into the top tier of Premier League forwards. Mbeumo has been at Brentford for six years, having joined from French side Troyes when they were in the Championship.",
      "His form for Brentford has earned admiring glances before – and just not from rival clubs. Back in the summer of 2022 it was legendary former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto’o who was keeping an eye on him in his role as president of the Cameroon Football Federation.",
      "Mbeumo was born in France and played for Les Bleus’ from under-17 to under-21 level, but never received a senior call-up. His dad is from Cameroon and Eto’o came to see Mbeumo with a proposal ahead of the 2022 World Cup.",
      "“It was just the two of us, I met him in a restaurant,” Mbeumo told the Brentford club website back in November 2022. “He came to London to see me. I know from my dad, who’s Cameroonian, that it could be a good opportunity.",
      "“When he approached me in the first place, I didn’t know if I would go or not. But after speaking to him, he explained to me about the project and I was happy with it. Afterwards, he gave me a bit of time to think about it before I gave my decision, and then I decided to play for them.",
      "“I was a bit nervous to meet him! He’s a legend of African football and football in general. I also asked him questions about being a striker, how he did certain things, how he dealt with certain situations, and he gave me advice. Talking about football with him was great.”",
      "He added: “I’m very proud for me and my family to represent the country. My dad was very happy – I also did this for him. I knew how proud he would be and he felt amazing after I made my debut and played those two games.”",
      "Mbeumo now has 22 caps and six goals for Cameroon and is hoping to take the next step in his club career this summer. While he wants to keep hold of him, Brentford manager Thomas Frank knows his star player is capable of taking a step up – even if it is to a team, like United, who finished five places lower this season.",
      "“I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he’s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.”",

      "Amid interest from Arsenal and Newcastle, Mbeumo has indicated his desire to join the Red Devils, despite their torrid Premier League campaign and missing out on European football. A deal to sign Mbeumo is not yet done, with the 25-year-old believed to be demanding a £250,000-per-week deal.",
      "But if United do get their man, he will not just sharpen up their forward line but provide the leadership the team has been lacking in recent seasons, says his current manager, Frank. Captain Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are widely regarded as United's only ‘leaders’ amid widespread attitude concerns within the squad.",
      "That trait persuaded United to extend the often-maligned Maguire’s contract to the summer of 2026. His deal was originally due to expire this summer.",
      "Speaking in January, head coach Ruben Amorim said: “When you look at our team, we are starving for leaders on the pitch. He [Maguire] is a leader. He has to improve that part and he has to improve our game. We are happy to continue with him.\"",
      "According to Frank, Mbeumo, who arrived in west London from French side Troyes in 2019, offers leadership as well as goals. Speaking in 2023, the Danish coach said following a win over West Ham: “I praised him a couple of weeks ago because he drives training with his attitude and work ethic and determination to want to get better and win.\" Frank then pointedly added: “He’s definitely a leader in the making.”",
      "United have already made one move in the transfer market this summer by signing Brazil forward Cunha.

Fernandes confirmed he had rejected the chance to move after speaking to Amorim and his family.",
      "“The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there,” Fernandes told a Portugal press conference, according to Portuguese outlet O Jogo.",

      "Steven Gerrard has warned Liverpool that Manchester City will be their biggest rivals for the Premier League title next season – but he doesn’t expect Manchester United to be anywhere near the top. The Reds will aim to defend their 20th league title in 2025/26 following Arne Slot’s successful debut campaign and Gerrard has named the sides to worry about.",
      "Liverpool finished 10 points clear of Arsenal this season, securing their first title since 2020 with a thumping win over Tottenham on April 27. They boasted the league’s best attack – thanks largely to top-scorer Mohamed Salah, who managed 29 goals himself – and the second-best defence.",
      "The club are keen to reinforce their squad in the summer transfer window and have already signed Jeremie Frimpong and are chasing the signature of his former Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz. Slot will have the summer to build a new squad, but former Liverpool captain Gerrard is expecting tougher opposition next season.",
      "\"Liverpool will be well aware that they're going to be the ones that are hunted now. But evidence suggests that Liverpool are going to be strong in the transfer market, so Liverpool are the team to catch for sure.\"",
      "City rallied to finish third in the Premier League, just three points behind Arsenal – who finished second for the third straight year – but saw their title chances evaporate early in the season. However, Pep Guardiola has signed a new contract and City will have key Ballon d’Or-winning midfielder Rodri back available for the start of the next campaign.",
      "Gerrard added: \"I think you've got to be wary of City and Guardiola. The best manager in the world. They've done it four years on the spin, they lost Rodri, which was a big blow to them.",
      "\"I think with a fully fit squad, and they're going to recruit as well, the team that finishes above City will win it again and hopefully, that’s Liverpool.\"",
      "United finished 15th in Ruben Amorim’s debut season and their defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham means they won’t play any European football next season. They will undergo the biggest squad overhaul of all Premier League clubs this summer, with Matheus Cunha expected to be the first of many arrivals once his £62.5million deal goes through.",
      "But United will clearly need more time to improve under Amorim before they can compete for the title once again. \"We are not ready to play in the Premier League, be competitive, and to be in the Champions League,\" he admitted last month.",

      "The agent of Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has confirmed that he's in talks to sign a new contract, pouring cold water on links of a shock move to Manchester United. Donnarumma, 26, helped PSG win the Champions League final on Saturday, although he had little to do as they hammered Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich.",
      "It's the second time that the former AC Milan star has been a champion of a Europe, having been the hero for Italy at Euro 2020 with two penalty saves in the final against England. PSG signed him that summer on a five-year deal, having left Milan in acrimonious circumferences.",
      "That contract expires in June 2026 and it was reported this week that United are among the clubs monitoring his situation. Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim would like to sign a new goalkeeper amid concerns over Andre Onana but Old Trafford chiefs aren't planning to spend big unless their current first-choice shot-stopper decides to leave.",
      "Napoli were also claimed to be interested in Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - says that talk a move to the Serie A winners is 'pure fantasy'. Instead, they're in talks with PSG over extending his stay in Paris.",
      "\"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"It's an obvious question; many would like him, but only a few can afford him. He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal [with PSG].\"",
      "Raiola hasn't ruled out a move to Napoli in the future, though, as Donnarumma is from Castellammare, a town in the Metropolitan City of Naples. \"His mother is a huge Napoli fan, and she gets anxious watching their games. Gigio is connected to that,\" his representative continued.",
      "Which goalkeeper should Manchester United sign instead? Let us know your choice in the comments section.",
      "\"He grew up as a Milan supporter, watching his older brothers in a Rossoneri shirt, but he never denied his roots. In fact, his first stop during the holidays is always Castellammare.\"",
      "Donnarumma's performances dipped in the early part of the season before he and his team-mates clicked into gear after the winter break, going on to win the treble. His saves against Premier League trio Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal during the Champions League knockout phase were vital to Luis Enrique's all-conquering side."

      "A fan on social media has suggested making a tifo with Bruno Fernandes' head on Belfort's body with the quote written across it, but it would never be approved by Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes' explanation for staying at Old Trafford - he spoke at a press conference on Tuesday night - certainly wasn't as dramatic as Belfort's for staying at Stratton Oakmont.",
      "Al-Hilal are the most successful club in Saudi Arabia and a huge financial package was on the table for Fernandes, but their interest was rebuffed and he will remain in Manchester.",
      "\"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me,\" said Fernandes.",
      "\"They talked to my agent, but I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what I wanted to do with my future. Never did she say yes or no, or offer to make the decision for me.",
      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",
      "Fernandes' decision to stay must be considered as excellent news. He has been the greatest signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, he is the standard setter in the dressing room and just won a fourth Player of the Year award.",
      "United would have banked a significant transfer fee for a player who will turn 31 in September, but nobody would have trusted the club to reinvest it sensibly in the transfer market.",
      "Fernandes' decision has been celebrated, although it will have implications for others in the dressing room, who might have been better off if the club captain had packed his bags.",
      "Manuel Ugarte probably falls into that category because Fernandes is expected to predominantly play in the midfield pivot next season. United have signed Matheus Cunha and they want to sign Bryan Mbeumo, so that pair will occupy the No.10 roles, provided Mbeumo also arrives from Brentford.",
      "Fernandes increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed, and there are doubts about whether a partnership with Ugarte is solid enough to move up the table.",
      "There have been some good displays from Ugarte, sometimes alongside Fernandes in the pivot, but Amorim will be unsure whether they are a good enough midfield pairing for next season.",
      "If Fernandes had decided to join Al-Hilal, a new midfielder would have been brought in this summer to play alongside Ugarte, but it now feels like Ugarte will be the player facing the axe from the starting XI.",
      "To make Fernandes work in the No.8 role, a higher-quality midfield partner will be required, and it's disappointing that United might already need to sign a player of that ilk after splashing £42.3m on Ugarte.",
      "There is also the question of where Kobbie Mainoo fits in Amorim's plans next season. Does he play in deeper midfield? Cunha and Mbeumo should be the first choice in the No.10 roles.",
      "Ugarte is not the only player facing uncertainty and there are plenty of moving parts."

      "As starts to a summer transfer window go, Manchester United have made a solid one.",
      "United wasted no time in securing their first signing of the window, announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves just 14 hours after the window had opened on Sunday, following their decision to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "The Reds are determined to strengthen their attacking options this summer and now have their sights set on signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo. The attacker is understood to be keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "With that in mind, what business should United be striving to oversee this summer? MEN Sport has had a close look:",
      "Outgoings will be key to United head coach Ruben Amorim securing the incomings he both wants and needs. United's failure to qualify for next season's Champions League means their budget is not as big as it might have been, making sales all the more important.",
      "However, the Reds could find the task of shifting Sancho that little bit more challenging now that Chelsea have pulled out of the obligation to sign him on a permanent basis. They have paid a £5m penalty fee.",
      "Fellow attacker Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed by Amorim that he can leave the club for the right price. United now operate with a winger-less system, meaning the Argentine is no longer able to play his natural game at Old Trafford.",
      "The same, too, can be said of Rashford, Sancho and Antony. It is no secret that United are open to offers for every member of their squad this summer, but they are, of course, actively to offload some more than others.",
      "After a regressive second season at Old Trafford, United chiefs have lost patience with Rasmus Hojlund and he could be sold. The Danish striker is attracting interest from Inter Milan and other Italian clubs.",
      "He scored just four Premier League goals this season and is simply not good enough to be spearheading United's attack. He scored ten goals across all competitions this term.",
      "United should also be looking to cash-in on Casemiro. Despite producing an improved set of performances this calendar year, the Brazilian is close to entering the final year of his contract and will turn 34 in February. United will need to bank around £15m for him to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules [PSR].",
      "Furthermore, United should also be attempting to offload defenders Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The former has struggled to stay fit over the course of the last two seasons and Malacia was sent out on loan to PSV Eindhoven for the second half of the season.",
      "Finding a buyer for Shaw, however, a task for United that is easier said than done. His injury record has lowered his valuation and suitors will be mindful of his history on the injury front.",
      "Meanwhile, United should also be trying to sell goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. He has failed to live up to expectations when he has deputised for Andre Onana and he will almost certainly be keen to try and secure first-team football for next season ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "Despite already getting Cunha through the door, United plan for further additions in attack. As already documented, they are keen on signing Mbeumo to strengthen the right-sided No.10 position, and they also need a striker.",
      "The addition of a centre-forward has never been as crucial at Old Trafford. United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and need to reduce the risk of that happening again by landing a new No.9.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, United are yet to decide in which direction their striker search will head in. They are being linked with several big-name No.9s, including Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Napoli want to offload Osimhen this summer, making him an attainable option, but raising funds via player sales will be key to United's chances of signing the Nigerian international. He would be the perfect addition to United's attack after scoring 85 goals over the last three seasons.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United also want to recruit a goalkeeper this summer to rival Onana for the No.1 spot. They need an upgrade on Bayindir and Amorim wants someone who can regularly compete with and challenge Onana.",
      "Should United sign Mbeumo, the likelihood is Amad will operate from right wing-back, meaning he will compete with Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui for that particular starting berth. That means there could be greater value in trying to sign a left wing-back to challenge and compete with Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The addition of a midfielder also has to be a top priority for United. Manuel Ugarte experienced an up and down first season at the club, meaning there is value in trying to find an upgrade on him.",
      "Goalkeepers: Andre Onana, Tom Heaton (if he signs a new contract) and a new goalkeeper.",
      "Centre-backs: Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven & Tyler Fredricson.",
      "Wing-backs: Noussair Mazraoui, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Harry Amass, Amad & a new left wing-back.",
      "Midfielders: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes & a new midfielder.",
      "Attackers: Joshua Zirkzee, Matheus Cunha, Chido Obi, Bryan Mbeumo & Victor Osimhen.",

      "Cunha is expected to play as a No. 10, having operated in that position in the same system as Amorim plays at Wolves, and while Mbeumo can also operate as a No. 10 and bring a left-footed option, he could also fill the centre-forward role. United could also look to sign another striker, especially if Hojlund or Zirkzee depart.",

      "United have moved quickly to address that issue by signing 17-goal Matheus Cunha from Wolves and targeting a move for 20-goal Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Remember Lisandro Martinez? He could return from a serious injury around the new season.",
      "The worst was feared when Martinez fell to the ground against Crystal Palace in February, as his knee buckled as he landed and he looked distraught as he was stretched off the pitch.",
      "The bad news was subsequently confirmed: Martinez tore the cruciate ligament in his knee. United did not communicate a timeline on when he could return, but Martinez was expected to face a lengthy spell of between six and nine months on the sidelines, depending on how his rehabilitation progressed.",
      "Martinez suffered the knee injury at the beginning of February and four months have passed, so it would probably be a stretch to expect him to feature during pre-season games in July.",
      "The beginning of August could be a possible return date for Martinez, though, at least to be working on grass, which suggests he could be available for selection shortly after the new season begins.",
      "United will not rush Martinez back to prevent aggravating the injury, but August seems a realistic target for him to work toward and a September return might even be in the back of his mind.",
      "It's common for players with serious injuries to set provisional dates to target their return so they can be motivated during the rehabilitation process, which can be mentally challenging.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of the campaign. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The defender also took part in the lap of appreciation at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. He was joined by his wife and newborn, and was spotted waving at supporters.",
      "Martinez quickly became a fan favourite after his arrival from Ajax in the summer of 2022, but he has missed chunks of time on the pitch due to injuries and his form dropped this season.",
      "The Argentina international was previously considered undroppable. He was one of the first names on the team sheet. However, Martinez will not go immediately back into the starting XI when he gets back up to speed following his lay-off.",
      "It goes without saying that a player returning from a serious injury wouldn't start straight away, but Martinez will be forced to fight for his place when he's considered 100 per cent fit.",
      "Martinez's performances were mixed this term and some displays were a far cry from those he produced in his first season in Manchester, which earned him popularity among fans.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not consider dropping Martinez because he was the only left-footed centre-back in the squad. But everything changed when Ayden Heaven was signed in January and, more importantly, when Amorim experimented by starting Leny Yoro on the left side of the defensive trio.",
      "Yoro has been excellent since his relocation to the left. The Frenchman grew in confidence with each month during his first season and he ended the campaign strongly in that role.",
      "The 19-year-old will be nailed on to start in that position on the opening day of the new season and it will be fascinating to see whether Martinez can win that role back, provided each defensive option is fit.",
      "Martinez has gone from having no competition for his role to having Yoro and Heaven breathing down his neck, which should help him raise his level when he returns from his knee injury.",
      "There is finally competition for the left-sided centre-back role in Amorim's system."

      "Manchester United could begin the 2025/26 season with a new-look attack, with Matheus Cunha signed and United working on a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After a season to forget that saw United finish 15th in the Premier League and trophyless, there are big improvements to be made to Ruben Amorim's side if he wants to compete for European football next season.",
      "No European football for the upcoming campaign threatened to dampen United's chances of recruiting big names in the summer transfer window, but it's not proved a problem yet, with Amorim's side securing the £62.5million transfer of Cunha from Wolves while also keeping hold of captain Bruno Fernandes following interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Next up on United's list is Brentford winger Mbeumo, with the Cameroon international looking destined for a move away from the Bees after scoring 20 goals in the Premier League last season. Mbeumo has indicated that he would like to join United over the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United, with the winger set to cost around £60million.",
      "So, if United were able to add Mbeumo to their ranks, how could the 25-year-old and Cunha perform under Amorim next season? Let's take a look...",
      "To set up this simulation, we used Football Manager 2024 to sign both Cunha and Mbeumo before simulating the 2025/26 season, and this is how the two attackers performed in their debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "United started the season with Cunha and Mbeumo in a front three with either Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund, but Amorim wasn't impressed by his strikers, with Zirkzee being loaned out in January while Hojlund was dropped. Mbeumo spent the second half of the season as a striker, and it paid off, with the Cameroon international ending the campaign as United's top goalscorer.",
      "In 35 appearances across all competitions, Mbeumo scored 19 goals and grabbed three assists, with the 25-year-old impressing in his first season at the club. Cunha also performed to the level expected of him, with the Brazilian scoring 10 and assisting 10 in 36 games.",
      "Fernandes was United's best player in the simulation though, with the midfielder grabbing 21 goal contributions while averaging a rating of 7.53 per game, the highest in the United squad and the third highest in the Premier League. At the end of the 2025/26 season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best Man United XI, based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:",
      "Full United best XI: (3-4-2-1): Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Mainoo, Fernandes, Mazraoui; Mbeumo, Cunha; Zirkzee.",
      "Fernandes joined Cunha and Mbeumo in the front three of United's best XI, with Amorim deploying his captain as a right winger in the second half of the season. Amad played most of the season as a wing-back, while Lisandro Martinez stayed fit all season long to join Matthijs de Ligt and Lenny Yoro at the back.",
      "With their new-look attack, United were a better team in the 2025/26 campaign, and that was proved in the Premier League as Amorim's side finished seventh, eight places higher than last season.",
      "15 wins, 13 draws and 10 losses saw United pick up 58 points in the simulation, four points fewer than Aston Villa in sixth and 12 points off the Champions League places.",
      "But, United did thrive in the FA Cup though, with both Cunha and Mbeumo getting on the scoresheet as Amorim's side beat Man City 2-1 in the FA Cup final to secure a spot in the Europa League. United also got to the Carabao Cup final, but a poor performance saw them lose 2-0 to Aston Villa at the final hurdle."

      "United are interested in signing the 25-year-old attacker and are keen to bring him to M16. He scored 20 Premier League goals this season, meaning he would be another statement addition.",

      "United will not play in Europe next season after losing last month's Europa League final, meaning they will be focusing purely on domestic matters. However, what is widely considered as a setback does not appear to be hindering the Reds so far this summer.",
      "As a result of missing out on European qualification, United do not have as big a transfer budget as they would have done had they qualified for Europe's premier club competition. It means they will have to box clever with elements of their recruitment this summer.",
      "But having already signed Cunha and now targeting Mbeumo, it has quickly become clear that United are in no mood to hang around. They want their business done as quickly as possible.",
      "Should United sign Mbeumo, the expectation is he will occupy the right-sided No.10 berth. Cunha has been signed to operate in the left-sided playmaker spot.",
      "As far as United's attack is concerned, that just leaves the No.9 position in need of a fresh face. United desperately need to sign a striker this summer and their hopes of signing Liam Delap from Ipswich Town are now dead in the water after he chose a move to Chelsea.",
      "It remains to be seen which direction United's striker search will now head in, but there are a handful of obvious candidates the club could turn to in their hunt for a chief goal-getter. Few are more appealing than Napoli striker Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Nigerian international, 26, has made a name for himself after becoming one of Europe's most prolific strikers in recent years. In the last three seasons alone, he has scored 85 goals.",
      "Osimhen spent this season on loan at Turkish club Galatasaray, scoring 37 times in 41 games, after falling out with Napoli head coach Antonio Conte last summer. Conte later admitted a permanent exit for the striker would have been \"better\".",
      "Napoli are keen to offload him on a permanent basis this summer and director Giovanni Manna, in February, confirmed the Italian club wants the striker's future resolved as quickly as possible.",
      "\"Victor is always going to be a hotly-debated topic and not just on the transfer market,\" Manna told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"He is an appetising player for clubs, he has a clause and everyone knows this, we are working to find a solution as quickly as possible, so that we can avoid what happened last year.\"",
      "Keen to offload him as quickly as possible, Napoli are unlikely to dig their heels in. It is understood his release clause is valued at £64million, meaning it is an attractive price for a striker so reliable in front of goal.",
      "United, though, do not have a bottomless pit of money this summer, meaning the prospect of them adding Osimhen and Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha without cutting their cloth is fanciful. They need to raise funds via player sales and they are eager to sell Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to name just a few.",
      "However, with Napoli eager to resolve Osimhen's future as quickly as possible, it puts pressure on United to shift their wantaway players just as fast. The window will temporarily close again next week before reopening on June 16.",
      "United, if they sell the likes of Rashford and Garnacho, will be hoping to bank around £80m as a minimum, meaning they have assets that can be sold to fund a deal for Osimhen, who has previously admitted playing in the Premier League is his \"dream\".",
      "Previously, a move for Osimhen would have been considered impossible amid the fact United cannot offer any form of European football for next season. The events of the last few days, however, have proven they still remain an enormous attraction."

      "His performances not only helped Betis mount a competitive run in La Liga, but also aided their run to the Conference League final, though that ended in a 4-1 defeat against Chelsea.",
      "Manuel Pellegrini's side want to retain Antony's services and are expected to initiate talks with United in an attempt to negotiate another loan agreement for the 2025/26 season. It's reported that Betis are willing to increase their financial commitment to the deal, which would cover a higher portion of his salary.",
      "However, United would prefer an outright sale rather than a temporary move, making the Seville club's task a little more difficult. His form has attracted attention from wider Europe, meanwhile, with Juventus the latest team to show an interest, as they look to strengthen their squad after securing Champions League qualification.",
      "According to UOL Esporte, Juventus placed Antony on their watchlist earlier in 2025 and are now considering a formal bid. Although Juve finished fourth in Serie A last season, they scored just 58 goals from their 38 league matches - fewer than eighth-place AC Milan - and are keen to add more firepower to their squad.",
      "Speaking after the Conference League final last month, Antony, who has two years left to run of his United contract, issued an update on his future and hinted at another move to Betis. He told CBS Sports: \"I don't what will happen in the future, only God knows. My work is playing and I'm doing that well.",
      "\"I have a lot of affection for Betis, for everyone but I have a contract with Man United and I don't know what's going to happen. Now I will go to the national team and then on holiday then we will see what happens in the future. I'm very happy here, everyone knows that but I have a contract.\""

      "Fernandes, 30, was understood to have given the move serious consideration amid United's willingness to sell any member of the squad this summer.",
      "However, he confirmed at a press conference on Tuesday evening that he has turned down a move to the Saudi outfit because of his hunger to continue playing at the highest level, boosting United's chances of retaining their star player.",

      "Fernandes is central to Amorim's plans, with the former Sporting Lisbon man often getting United out of trouble this season. He is effective from pretty much anywhere on the pitch and will always contribute goals and assists.",

      "Fernandes' durability and reliability is one of his biggest strengths. He played 57 times for United this season, missing only three matches, two of which were through suspension.",
      "United, as tempting as a £100m bid might have been for a soon-to-be 31-year-old, need players like Fernandes. He has been their best player of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era by some distance, and Amorim loves him.",

      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at Old Trafford. His decline began after signing for Manchester United and he failed to arrest his slump at Chelsea.",
      "The London-born lad scored in 4-1 victory against Real Betis in the Conference League final and will argue his loan was a success. Sancho will point to scoring in that game and his winner's medal. It's also important to note the move has collapsed due to Chelsea not being willing to meet his wage demands.",
      "That doesn't necessarily mean Chelsea don't want Sancho, but it does mean they don't believe he is worth the salary, and maybe that wouldn't have been an issue if he'd performed better.",
      "Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists has been deemed not good enough for the wages he wants and Chelsea are set to move on to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Chelsea want to sign Gittens in a £50million deal before the Club World Cup and Sancho should probably feel further embarrassment over that transfer for two different reasons.",
      "The first reason is that Gittens has leapfrogged Sancho, despite having been years behind him.",
      "Dortmund visited Leigh Sports Village to play United Under-19s in March 2022 and won on penalties, but a 16-year-old Gittens scored a brace in normal time and was the star of the show.",
      "At that time, Sancho had already spent eight months in Manchester after signing from Dortmund in a £72.9m transfer. He was regarded among the world's finest players, while Gittens was a teenager playing in front of a sparse crowd.",
      "The second reason is that Gittens is represented by the same agency - Elite Project Group - as Sancho. They know each other well and their career pathways have been similar.",
      "Sancho and Gittens both played in Manchester City's academy before joining Dortmund. There have been comparisons made between the pair and Gittens has given the impression of being a miniature Sancho.",
      "However, 'little brother' could surpass 'big brother' if he joins Chelsea this summer.",
      "Sancho will probably be happy for his agency stablemate Gittens and he might even advise him about what to expect at Cobham, although the optics of the move are not great for him.",
      "Gittens was just 16 and hadn't had a sniff of senior football when Sancho signed for United, so far apart were they in their careers, but that is clearly no longer the case.",
      "It must be said, Gittens always seemed destined to become a top player, but Sancho hasn't maintained his top player status and looks set to be surpassed by Gittens."

While Arsenal and Newcastle have been credited with an interest in Mbeumo, the Cameroon star is believed to favour a move to Old Trafford.",

      "When Manchester United officials walk past supporters in their club suits, the key figures are easy to spot. Fans will be aware of high-profile chief executive Omar Berrada and football director Jason Wilcox. They will instantly recognise some of the Ineos figures, such as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "But Matt Hargreaves could stroll past without any recognition. Despite that, the former Adidas market director is a key figure in the corridors of power at Old Trafford and when it comes to the wheeler-dealer nature of the transfer window, arguably the most important person.",
      "This summer, Wilcox will work closely with Ruben Amorim to identify what the head coach requires, both in terms of incomings and outgoings. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell plays an important role in identifying targets and dealing with agents. Then, director of football negotiations Hargreaves seeks to strike deals with clubs for players United want to sign and for those potentially on their way out.",
      "Negotiating with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha was a relatively straightforward start to the window, given the Brazilian's release clause. It was simply a case of agreeing on a payment structure. However, Brentford have already made it clear they will drive a hard bargain for Bryan Mbeumo, despite the 25-year-old having only a maximum of two years left on his contract and having made his preference for a move to Old Trafford clear.",
      "But Hargreaves' skills might be tested most acutely when it comes to departures. Sales will make this window go round for United, and they need to extract maximum value for players leaving the club.",
      "In the case of Alejandro Garnacho, that might not be too difficult, given his age, talent and the level of performances he has already produced. Working against that will be the fact that Amorim has already made it clear he is finished at Old Trafford, giving buyers a pretty substantial edge in the market.",
      "Finding buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, and now Jadon Sancho might be more difficult. There will be pressure on Hargreaves as well, with Ratcliffe having made it clear he doesn't want the club to pay the wages of players who perform elsewhere. He wants the club to start bringing in more money and getting wages down, so sales rather than another loan will be the priority.",
      "One United source had previously declared the possibility of Chelsea deciding against signing Sancho permanently, and thereby paying a £5million penalty clause, as a \"win-win\" situation. You wonder if Hargreaves would have the same view.",
      "Chelsea taking the £25million option to sign Sancho would be the easiest course of action. Now, United must put the player back out to market and hope a club comes calling. The failure of the 25-year-old to agree personal terms with Chelsea suggests finding a club that can afford a fee and a salary package for the former England winger will be a challenge, although Hargreaves' ability to strike a fruitful deal with Borussia Dortmund to loan Sancho in January 2024 went down well at Old Trafford.",
      "The picture has changed since then, with Sancho about to head into the final year of his contract at the club and his future clearly lying away from United. A departure is required, which is also the case for Antony and Rashford. The former has at least enjoyed a productive loan spell with Real Betis, which United will hope to lead from interest elsewhere, as a permanent switch to Betis seems unlikely.",
      "Rashford's future also looks likely to lie away from Aston Villa. His spell in the Midlands was an encouraging return to form if not an outright success, but he once again has set his sights on Barcelona, despite the financial difficulties they are experiencing. Again, buyers have an upper hand in any potential deal for Rashford, with Amorim having made it clear he has no future under him.",
      "There had been an expectation that United could bank as much as £90million for Sancho, Antony and Rashford, but those sums are already beginning to look ambitious. Getting close to that figure will help supplement the transfer budget ahead of a season without European football, and all eyes will be on the least high-profile, but most important, executives in place at United."

      "Chelsea have reportedly offered West Ham seven players in exchange for £85m forward Mohammed Kudus this summer in a bid to beat Manchester United to his signature.",
      "It was announced by The Athletic’s David Ornstein on Tuesday that Chelsea would not be taking up their £25m obligation to buy Jadon Sancho this summer after a loan spell at Stamford Bridge last season.",
      "Sancho and the Blues could not agree on personal terms and Chelsea will now be forced to pay a £5m penalty instead for not taking up the obligation.",
      "After the news was revealed, Sancho took to Instagram to pen a farewell message to Chelsea fans, he wrote: “Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home – team-mates, staff, and the fans.",
      "“Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful, thank you Blues.”",
      "The Blues are therefore in the market for a new forward to play to the side of a central striker and it’s claimed they have reignited their interest in Kudus having been linked with the 24-year-old when he made his £38m to West Ham from Ajax in the summer of 2023.",
      "And according to transfer expert Graeme Bailey, the Blues have offered the Hammers seven players in a swap deal for Kudus, who reportedly has an £85m release clause.",
      "Robert Sanchez has been brought up in talks as they look to bring Milan’s Mike Maignan in as their new No.1, while midfielders Carney Chukwuemeka and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall as well as defenders Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi and Trevoh Chalobah have also been offered up in exchange.",
      "He told The Chelsea Chronicle: “So, I’m told that there’s been talk with West Ham a little bit about possibly looking at Kudus and with players in exchange.",
      "“I believe that Chelsea were offering Sanchez and Dewsbury-Hall but West Ham didn’t want that particularly, so yeah that’s an interesting one. Kudos, again a name who could be one to keep an eye on but obviously if it means Chelsea getting these players out. Dewsbury-Hall, we know is someone who can go. Robert Sanchez is one who they’re willing to let go which tells us about the goalkeeper situation.",
      "“West Ham we know were interested in Chalobah, Disasi, Tosin and Badiashile I think two or three of them are going to leave, but I think they want money for them, especially Tosin and Chalobah, because of the pure profit. I think Chukwuemeka has been mentioned as well to West Ham.”",

      "A report earlier on Wednesday claimed Manchester United have also tried to tempt West Ham into a swap deal for Kudus, offering Sancho in exchange.",
      "The report added that West Ham and Man Utd ‘couldn’t reach an agreement, so it currently seems unlikely that this will go through’.",
      "Kudus has been the subject of interest from Liverpool and Arsenal during his time in England, while there have also been links to Saudi Arabia, but the midfielder ‘would prefer to stay in Europe’.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to offload Jadon Sancho this summer and have offered him as part of a swap deal for a West Ham star, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are ready to make a ‘massive offer’ to sign West Ham attacking midfielder Mohamed Kudus in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool have been provided a potential boost as West Ham United star Mohammed Kudus is reportedly available for a cut-price fee this summer.",
      "Arne Slot heaped praise on three West Ham players after Liverpool edged closer to the Premier League title, with one transfer target ‘almost uncontrollable’."

      "Manchester United have ‘made contact’ over a move for Viktor Gyokeres as Ruben Amorim is ‘poised to win the battle’ for the Sporting striker in a huge blow for Arsenal.",
      "After a dismal season saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and miss out on European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, United are working quickly to secure signings to bolster Amorim’s squad ahead of his first full campaign in charge.",
      "Matheus Cunha will arrive after United triggered his £62.5m release clause and club chiefs are ‘in talks’ over a move for Bryan Mbeumo, who ‘wants to join’ the Red Devils.",
      "Brentford are asking for £60m for Mbeumo, while reports claim United are ‘prepared to meet Mbeumo’s whopping wage demands’ which stand at £250,000 a week, equating to £13m a year.",
      "The pair will likely play in the two inverted No.10 roles in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, but United are also desperately looking for a new striker, with Rasmus Hojlund failing to meet the mark for them in his two seasons at the club.",
      "They were keen on Ipswich’s Liam Delap, but he’s opted to join Chelsea, but that move could open the door to Nicolas Jackson’s exit from Stamford Bridge, with United supposedly ‘interested’ in the Senegal international along with several other suitors.",
      "But a report from GIVEMESPORT claims they haven’t given up hope of landing Gyokeres, who is thought to be near the top of Arsenal’s shortlist, along with RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The report claims ‘Amorim has made it clear to the Old Trafford hierarchy that he is desperate to seal a reunion with the Sporting star’ having been ‘not happy to see Delap pinpointed as Manchester United’s leading target’, with Gyokeres the striker he’s wanted all along.",
      "‘Amorim is poised to win the battle to convince the hierarchy to recruit a proven goalscorer’, though United must sell at least one high-profile star in order to raise funds for the £59m star.",
      "‘Gyokeres’ knowledge of Amorim’s demands is being seen as a major advantage’ by the Red Devils hierarchy, who are also considering a move for Victor Osimhen after his return to Napoli after a productive loan spell with Galatasaray.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has given his approval to the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo as the Red Devils need players “able to run, to travel with and without the ball”.",
      "Neville said on the US Overlap: “[Man United] need players who are going to come in and hit the ground running. United has become a very difficult place for new signings to operate in the last ten years.",
      "“Cunha and Mbeumo have obviously got Premier League experience. They’ve got plenty of games under their belt. [English football] is not new to them and actually they are the right type.",
      "“When I watch Manchester United wide players, they have to be able to get from box-to-box quickly. They have to be able to run, to travel with and without the ball. Mbeumo and, to be fair Cunha, can do that.",
      "“They can both run forward with real intent and purpose. A couple of two or three players who are going to leave, they are more ‘jinkers’. Players who, to be fair, play in smaller spaces.",
      "“For anybody who has played at Old Trafford, although the size of the pitch may in terms of metrics not be bigger, it just seems like a big pitch to play on. The width is important.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Danny Higginbotham has warned Ruben Amorim he will be judged next season if results do not pick up.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Football pundit Martin Keown has questioned the viability of head coach Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and come up with an absolutely bananas suggestion for a replacement.",

      "United also have other positions which they want to improve upon. One area in which they could look to sign one or two new players is in the midfield.",
      "According to a report from Caught Offside, their scouts have been impressed by the performances of Como midfielder Paz after monitoring him.",
      "Paz, in his first season since leaving Real Madrid – where he played just eight senior games and scored once after coming through the academy – scored six Serie A goals and assisted a further nine.",
      "It’s believed Real are eager to re-sign him after seeing those returns, but Paz will not ‘rush back’ to the Bernabeu unless he’s assured a regular first-team place.",
      "The presence of Jude Bellingham, Federico Valverde, Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga suggests that might not be possible.",
      "As such, the report suggests United could be given a ‘serious opportunity’ to move for Paz. The situation could be determined by who is at the helm at Como next season.",
      "Current boss Cesc Fabregas has only used two players more often than he has Paz in his as yet short managerial career.",
      "He is obviously a big fan of the midfielder, and likely does not want to see him leave. With that said, the Spaniard is currently being considered for the Inter Milan manager role, with current boss Simone Inzaghi leaving for Saudi Arabia.",
      "Inter have asked for permission to speak to Fabregas and some reports suggest he is on the verge of taking over at the Champions League finalists.",
      "If that is the case, he would of course have no say on the future of Paz – unless he wanted to sign him for Inter – and whoever takes over at Como would not have the same connection Fabregas has with the midfielder, and could be open to his sale.",
      "Things might become more clear in regards to Paz’s future once a decision has been made on Fabregas’."

      "Manchester City are heavily represented in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Matheus Cunha is in but No 1) will never be shifted.",
      "",
      "1) Neymar – £200m/€222m (Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2017)\nA fee so ridiculous La Liga refused to receive the payment so PSG said LOL to FFP and handed the money straight to Barcelona, activating one of those stratospheric release clauses designed to typically make such transfers essentially impossible.",
      "",
      "2) Eden Hazard – £143m/€160m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, July 2019)\nThe initial payment of £88.5m alone would have been a disastrous transfer, but Hazard accidentally activated enough variables in between numerous injuries before his retirement to make this an all-time great waste of money.",
      "",
      "3) Philippe Coutinho – £142m/€160m (Liverpool to Barcelona, January 2018)\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint the most damning aspect of this deal from a buyer’s perspective, but it’s somewhere between the £106m initial fee, the £26.4m in clauses paid out for Coutinho’s first 90 appearances, the £89m premium Barcelona reluctantly agreed to pay if they signed any further Liverpool players in the next two years, the fact Coutinho won the Champions League with Bayern Munich while on loan from the Nou Camp, scoring twice in the 8-2 quarter-final humiliation of the Catalans, or the knockdown price of £17m paid by Aston Villa after four underwhelming years.",
      "",
      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",
      "",
      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "16) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "18) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "19) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",
      "",
      "20) Riyad Mahrez – £60m/€68m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nAn underappreciated Premier League legend only reinforced his status at Manchester City. Just 10 players have won more Premier League titles – none of whom have a medal with two different clubs – than Mahrez, who ranks joint 53rd all-time for goals and 21st for assists.",

      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof are both leaving at the end of their contracts, while Jonny Evans has chosen to retire.",

      "Last week Earps called time on her international career. The decision followed a meeting with England manager Sarina Wiegman, in which she was told she wouldn’t be her number one goalkeeper at the Euros.",

      "Look, Joe Root is lovely and brilliant and all the rest of it, but this is a genuinely insane comparison.",
      "These are not remotely comparable situations. When he gave up the captaincy, Root was 31 years old and unquestionably still England’s best batter. There was no suggestion whatsoever he might lose his place in England’s first-choice XI, as Earps has.",
      "Faced with entirely different situations, Root wanted to carry on and Earps didn’t. Both are entirely valid choices and neither really any of our business.",
      "You don’t have to like the choice Earps has made, and especially the way it’s all played out, but you do have to acknowledge that her situation and Root’s are not in any useful or meaningful way the same, and not just because they play completely different sports.",

      "Those, including my F365 colleagues, with whom I’ve already shared this most scalding of takes have reacted with a mixture of hilarity and concern for my wellbeing. So I’ve given it further consideration and I’m doubling down; United absolutely should sign Vardy.",
      "Here for free – important, that – is a proven goalscorer, a fox in the box, a nasty b*stard (meant entirely as a compliment) and a title winner who could take the number of Premier League champions in the Old Trafford dressing room to… one. Vardy would be an asset to Ruben Amorim, putting him in a very select group of Manchester United footballers.",
      "I’m not ignoring the obvious point of contention: Vardy is old. Thirty-eight. Which in footballer years is ancient.",
      "But he hasn’t got as many miles on the clock as veterans of a similar age. Vardy’s professional career started at 24; his Football League career at 25. Most of his contemporaries reach 14 years as a senior pro between 32 and 34.",
      "And United absolutely don’t need Vardy for the future. Their outlay on wages will not be recouped and there will be no resale value. Not every signing can be viewed in such terms. But signing the ex-England striker could be seen as an investment in the younger forwards who so clearly need the spark and guidance Vardy could offer.",
      "But more than a mentor, Vardy can still show how it’s done. In a genuinely awful Leicester side, he scored more Premier League goals than any United player last season, and in 35 appearances, he played more minutes than all but two of Amorim’s outfielders.",
      "Right now, Amorim has one centre-forward he can call upon: Rasmus Hojlund. And they would sell him without hesitation if someone offered half the price they paid in 2023. The chances of that seem as low as the Dane’s goals record last season. And his confidence. But if they get him some help, in terms of service and a stand-in, it could yet work out if United are forced to make the best of him.",
      "That is especially true since Liam Delap thought Chelsea – Todd Boehly’s Chelsea – were better trusted with his development. Even if Delap had been convinced to join United, they would still have needed a more experienced striker given they currently have none.",
      "They might sign Bryan Mbeumo. And many would expect that to be a savvy addition. But what would they be signing in Mbeumo? Certainly not an out-and-out striker. Much of the appeal is the Cameroonian’s ability to play across the front line. He scored 20 goals last season, many of them while drifting in from the Brentford right, and it seems Amorim eyes Mbeumo more as a no.10.",

      "But what good is all that creativity without someone to apply the finishing touch? If United somehow muster the money to buy a proven no.9 – not another 9.5 – their centre-forward pool is still perilously shallow, even allowing for the lighter workload without European involvement.",
      "United haven’t been scared of recruiting veteran strikers. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was 35; Henrik Larsson was 34. Both were big hits at Old Trafford, for their influence in the dressing room as much as their impact in the box.",
      "Vardy could have a similar impact. He insists he is not looking to wind down after leaving Leicester, and Ruud van Nistelrooy offered a glowing reference: “He is one of the most open and honest people I have met…he isn’t hard to manage.”",
      "Like Zlatan for Jose Mourinho and Larsson for Fergie, Vardy would be a leader for Amorim, a manager with pitifully few such characters to lean on, and a goal threat where currently there is almost none.",

      "Man Utd used to sign the ‘best’ players from Premier League rivals; moves for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo suggest a welcome return of that ‘policy’.",
      "",
      "Gary Neville once kindly explained the three facets which comprised the transfer philosophy of Sir Alex Ferguson, if indeed such a thing could exist for a manager whose career spanned almost four decades.",
      "“There were three categories to the policy,” the pundit said. “He wanted to promote youth wherever possible, that was number one before he even looked at the external market.”",
      "If “promote” is actually a synonym for “offload” – and in the dictionary of Big Sir Jim most things seem to be – then consider that box ticked by Man Utd in 2025.",
      "“Number two was to look at the best in the Premier League; those he could trust and still have growth and be with the club for a long time: Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Robin van Persie.”",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha, pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo and potential targeting of more stars close to home suggests the dying art which underpinned so much of the club’s modern success has been resuscitated.",
      "“And then he always wanted emerging international talent that could come over to Manchester, that he could work with and develop into great players: Nemanja Vidic, Peter Schmeichel, Patrice Evra, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Manuel Ugarte, Antony, Andre Onana. The list goes on.",
      "The second point is the most pertinent to the current era and provides long-overdue proof of some joined-up thinking with recruitment at Carrington. Mbeumo and Cunha were the two biggest overperformers on xG in the Premier League last season, are 25 and 26 and feel like precisely the sort of signings Liverpool would make under Jurgen Klopp: players proven in the ever-improving middle of England’s top flight, but with an obvious scalability to develop and perform at a higher level.",
      "MORE FEATURES FROM F365\n👉 Arsenal must accept mantle of Banter Club in Premier League mood rankings\n👉 Man Utd face ‘silly’ tax over Mbeumo transfer after ‘irritating’ rivals who ‘may ask for a higher fee’\n👉 Mbeumo confusion explained by biggest signings made by clubs ‘pushing the train’ to Champions League",
      "That comes with caveats: one season of xG overperformance presents obvious issues with sustainability and these are extortionate costs for a club publicly walking a PSR tightrope, who need to nail every aspect of their transfer business this summer. But if the argument was that sacrificing Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo would only be for the greater good if Man Utd could be trusted to spend the money properly, removing their erratic and unreliable recruitment from the equation to simply buy the closest things to guaranteed successes might make it work.",
      "Ferguson leaned on those intra-Premier League transfers to build the foundation for each of his great Man Utd squads. There were some David Bellions along the way but a ludicrous XI can be assembled from such signings: Van der Sar; Valencia, Smalling, Ferdinand, Young; Keane, Carrick, Smith; Tevez, Yorke, Rooney, with Robin van Persie, Dimitar Berbatov, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Jones on an absurdly attacking bench.",
      "But in the years since his retirement it was an ideology slowly phased out for style over substance, culminating in the ruinous summer of 2021. Man Utd were at a crossroads, Premier League and Europa League runners-up with fairly deep runs in the domestic cups behind them, but with a strong sense that while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had built a solid base, he had reached a point where someone else was required to push on and capitalise on his work.",
      "Man Utd avoided answering that awkward question and signed players from Real Madrid, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund instead, because they wanted the honour and esteem of being seen to deal with such clubs without a second thought as to whether Raphael Varane, Cristiano Ronaldo or Jadon Sancho actually added more to the squad than they took away, and Solskjaer was sacked within a matter of months.",
      "The club chose the wrong path then, in their last true position of strength in summer 2023 when they hedged one too many bets on Onana, Mason Mount and Hojlund, and the following year when instead of sacking Erik ten Hag, they doubled down by spending £200m on players not only specifically for him, but categorically incompatible with the replacement they inevitably had to appoint.",
      "The hope is that hitting rock bottom can prompt better decisions at this latest seasonal junction; the early signs are promising. Neville once said “if you had the best player in the Premier League, Man Utd had to buy that player”. Times have changed and those signings have long been unattainable, but buying the best Premier League players actually available to them seems like a sensible alternative Man Utd have long ignored.",

      "Man Utd are set ‘to open talks’ with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, who ‘has decided he wants to join’ the Red Devils, according to David Ornstein.",

      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo picking this abysmal version of Manchester United over Champions League teams has boggled minds but there is plenty of precedent.",
      "While Cunha has joined from Wolves with little competition for his signature, the revelation that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United, a team which finished five places lower than the Brentford side for which he scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has confused many.",
      "Newcastle, Spurs and Arsenal were all linked with the Cameroonian forward but it is hardly the first time Manchester United have beaten Champions League clubs to a signing despite having no Champions League football to offer themselves. Plenty of other clubs have managed it too.",
      "",
      "10) Bruno Guimaraes\nThe spot could just as easily go to Alexander Isak, but Newcastle were at least on an obvious upward trajectory when they shattered their transfer record to sign the Swede from Real Sociedad in August 2022.",
      "The Magpies would qualify for the Champions League at the end of that season, with Isak’s goals a critical factor in helping transform Eddie Howe’s side. Yet it was Guimaraes who boarded the ship when the shore was a speck in the distance.",
      "Newcastle were in the relegation zone below Norwich when they somehow tempted Guimaraes to turn his back on long-term interest from Arsenal, the Brazilian having also popped up on radars at Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "“We are definitely going to be a club that is going to be a big power in world football,” said Guimaraes, and while it seems obvious in hindsight, in the exciting but uncertain post-takeover haze, it was far from guaranteed that Newcastle would embark on a revolution he helped kickstart.",
      "",
      "9) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\nThings did not work out in a way that suited any party. The captain’s armband was stripped, the non-negotiables were ignored, backs were stabbed and the contract Arsenal were desperate for Aubameyang to sign after winning them the FA Cup was written off months early.",
      "Yet for a time there was talk of statues, proof of leadership, the glory of trophies and the scoring of more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez in fewer appearances than Philippe Senderos.",
      "It is a truly imperious record for Arsene Wenger’s last signing as a manager. A club-record fee was needed to extract Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund, the Gabon international departing as the Bundesliga’s Player of the Year in 2016 and Golden Boot winner of 2017. By the time it came to leaving Germany in January 2018, Arsenal were sixth in the Premier League and locked in the existential crisis that was their first year outside the Champions League since 2000.",
      "Aubameyang was supposed to be one of the building blocks placed in the foundation of Arsenal’s recovery; his removal ended up being part of the process in re-establishing their relevance as a force.",
      "",
      "8) Sadio Mane\n“If a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions,” Ruben Amorim told Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Jurgen Klopp ultimately put it best:",
      "“I always tell players if, when you are 35 or 36, you look back on your career and think about the one year you didn’t play Champions League, then you are really a poor boy. There are so many things you can do and reach if you go together with the team. You can qualify for the Champions League, play Champions League, maybe win it or whatever. That is a much more satisfying thing than all the rest. That is what I would say to players: ‘It is about pushing the train, not jumping on a running train.’ That is what we need here. If somebody says: ‘But you don’t play Champions League next year’, then goodbye and thank you, have fun next year wherever you will be. We will find players or we have players already that will go our way. That is not my way, that is the normal way for a club not playing in the Champions League.”",
      "The German did not have to worry about it often, only coaching two full Liverpool seasons outside Europe’s elite competition, but it was true. The Reds signed Sadio Mane 88 days later and Klopp secured one of the strongest pushers of his Champions League train in the process.",
      "Not only were the Reds out of Europe altogether in summer 2016, but they had finished two places below the Southampton side they were buying from. Mane bet not only on himself but the Klopp vision. A Premier League, Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup and Golden Boot suggests he was right.",
      "",
      "7) Moises Caicedo\nLiverpool supporters consumed dangerous and absurd levels of copium to come to terms with Caicedo’s decision to reject them in favour of joining Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "It was understandable to an extent. The Reds, managed by Jurgen Klopp, had just finished seven places higher than the Blues, who were a bastion of instability and player churn. The decision between the two seemed obvious once it was clear both were willing to make it worth Brighton’s trouble.",
      "But players tend not to glance at the most recent league table before making career calls. Caicedo took the most expensive step down in Premier League history and has played a considerable part in pulling Chelsea back up since.",
      "",
      "6) Leny Yoro\nReal Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool were among those linked but it was Manchester United who completed a genuine transfer coup in signing a player former sporting director Dan Ashworth described as “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”.",
      "Some will put that down to money, or more specifically the pressure selling club Lille reportedly applied on Yoro to take the more lucrative Manchester United offer.",
      "But for a Europa League club to capture such a coveted teenager was yet more proof of that unique allure Manchester United still possess. Yoro was seven when they had last won the title and still in nappies for their most recent Champions League crowning, yet Old Trafford still called.",
      "",
      "5) Luis Suarez\nWhile he would win the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, Suarez had only graced the competition proper in one season, scoring a solitary goal during the 2010/11 campaign in which Ajax exited at the group stage.",
      "He joined Liverpool later that season and by the time he had finally dragged them to European Cup qualification for the first time in half a decade in 2014, the Uruguayan forewent the fruits of his labour to rock up in Spain.",
      "Liverpool had finished seventh before Suarez joined, then sixth, eighth and seventh with him. But the forward was not tainted by those years of stagnation, scoring more than 50 goals. Among them were his efforts in the Europa League as Suarez netted four times in seven appearances in the 2012/13 season, which ended with him imploring Liverpool “to honour our agreement”, namely:",
      "“Last year I had the opportunity to move to a big European club and I stayed on the understanding that if we failed to qualify for the Champions League the following season I’d be allowed to go.”",
      "The Emirates was smoking to the tune of £1 but Suarez caught fire in 2013/14, rocketing Liverpool to a Premier League title tilt that faded in spectacular fashion for a runners-up medal. He left for Barcelona instead of sticking around long enough for Brendan Rodgers to put him on the bench at the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "4) Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nFrom his humble beginnings at Ajax in 2002/03 to the understated modesty that helped steer Paris Saint-Germain in 2015/16, Ibrahimovic did not miss a single Champions League campaign. He played at least six games in every season including and between those two quarter-final appearances, failing to score only when Igor Biscan belittled him in 2004/05.",
      "But it was neither injury nor under-performance that snapped that remarkable streak. Ibrahimovic instead vacated his seat at the European top table entirely of his own accord – by joining Manchester United.",
      "Louis van Gaal had sidestepped the first sign of the Pardpocalypse by quelling any Wembley dad dancing in the FA Cup final. The Dutchman also took Manchester United to within goal difference of the Champions League places but that was not enough and so Jose Mourinho was appointed. One of his first moves was to orchestrate the arrival of Ibrahimovic, who proceeded to talk the considerable talk while actually walking the quite brilliant walk.",
      "But the significant knee knack he suffered in the Europa League quarter-final meant he would play only one Champions League game for Manchester United. He holds the record of most different clubs represented in the European Cup at seven, even if his solitary match in the competition for the Red Devils was as a second-half substitute in defeat to Basel.",
      "",
      "3) N’Golo Kante\nA peculiar set of circumstances meant the £30m departure of the midfielder most vital to a Premier League title win for a team that had finished 10th passed by without much consternation or controversy.",
      "Leicester resigned themselves to the idea that Kante would be the first noteworthy cab off the King Power rank and Chelsea duly obliged after Arsenal pulled out of the running over seemingly extortionate agent fees.",
      "Kante thus had to wait until September 2017 for his first taste of the Champions League, missing out on Leicester’s journey to the quarter-final the previous year and instead busying himself winning a consecutive Premier League title. The Frenchman would claim his European Cup by 2021 as man of the match in the final, cementing a legacy of making up for lost time and receiving the ultimate award for what was quite the leap of faith five years previous.",
      "Chelsea were out of European competition completely but still signed the epitome of a Champions League calibre player as Kante called “the opportunity to work with Antonio Conte, a brilliant coach… simply too good to turn down”.",
      "It is unknown if he felt the same way about Frank Lampard.",
      "",
      "2) Angel di Maria\nHe was an ill fit, a ‘complete fanny’, the polar opposite to what his manager sought and emblematic of a period during which the club favoured style over substance in the transfer market. Manchester United made a loss on Di Maria less than a year after his purchase for good reason.",
      "But it was a monumental capture at the time, albeit a flexing of superficial muscles to stroke an ego bruised by one failed post-Sir Alex Ferguson season. Manchester United finished the 2013/14 campaign in seventh and under the caretaker guidance of Ryan Giggs; Di Maria ended it as man of the match in the Champions League final and leading assist provider in La Liga with 18, having scored in a Copa del Rey final win over Barcelona.",
      "The closest he ever got to playing European football for the Red Devils was the trip to lose 2-1 to Swansea in February 2015 before departing for Paris Saint-Germain that August.",
      "",
      "1) Paul Pogba\nThe world-record fee was used as a stick with which critics could relentlessly beat the haircut out of Pogba. His reign as the most expensive footballer ever lasted a solitary year before Neymar made the £89.3m Manchester United paid Juventus look like a Willian Prunier clean sheet bonus. Yet often forgotten is one of the many wrinkles in that deal: the pull of home, Mourinho or infuriating Graeme Souness on a weekly basis persuaded one of the best young players around to abandon a recent Champions League finalist and serial Serie A title winner for whatever state Van Gaal left Old Trafford in.",
      "It was believed at the time that Real Madrid were the favourites – proving one immutable transfer truth – but when Los Blancos withdrew from the race over money, it was time to dust off Stormzy for the unveiling.",
      "From December 2015 to September 2017, Manchester United’s last chapter in their estimable European Cup history was to bring on Nick Powell against Wolfsburg. In between, they spent more on a player than any team ever before. Pogba remains the last player to open the scoring in a winning continental final for the club, putting Ajax to the Europa League sword to ensure Champions League qualification for a club that finished seven points off fourth in his first season.",
      "Pogba had his pick of clubs as a precocious and prodigious 23-year-old; both he and Manchester United might choose differently if given the option again.",
      "READ NEXT: Manchester United above Newcastle, Spurs, Atletico in ranking of transfer allure to new signings",

      "Man Utd should make move to re-sign former Red Devils midfielder Paul Pogba as they can’t “afford not to consider a move”, according to Dwight Yorke.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we look at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is off to Real Madrid. Naturally, we have picked the biggest free transfer departure for each Premier League club.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘advancing’ to secure their first summer signing ahead of a major squad overhaul."

      "41) Wout Weghorst (£2.6m loan fee) (23)\nWeghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",

      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",

      "38) Nemanja Matic (£40m) (23)\nMan Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",
      "",
      "36) Rasmus Hojlund (£64.7m) (17)\nIt’s make or break for Hojlund next season…if he’s still at the club.",
      "",
      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",

      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",

      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",

      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",

      "",

      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to offload Jadon Sancho this summer and have offered him as part of a swap deal for a West Ham star, according to reports.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Mikael Silvestre has given his verdict on what needs to happen next with Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Jadon Sancho will return to Man Utd this summer after Chelsea paid the £5m penalty to cancel their obligation to buy the winger, according to reports.",

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood. They will also make a few pennies on Amdouni after a decent loan spell with Benfica.

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed that a request from Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was one of the main factors in him rejecting a move to Al Hilal.",
      "Fernandes was one of the only standout performers in the United side last season. He was the top scorer in the Premier League, where the Red Devils finished 15th, and in all competitions, he was directly involved in 38 goals.",
      "He recently reiterated his commitment to United, but that was put to the test by interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, who were willing to pay him a big sum of money to join.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed on June 3 that Fernandes had decided against the move, as he wanted to continue playing at the top level in Europe.",
      "Now, Fernandes has revealed manager Amorim had a big say in his decision.",
      "“There was an opportunity. The [Al Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there,” Fernandes said.",
      "“They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "“Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "“Al Hilal were very kind. They spoke to my agent. Then I spoke to my wife. She asked: ‘What do you want to do?’ She always supports my decisions.",
      "“It would have been easy to move there. I know the Portuguese players there very well. But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles.",
      "“I can do that, and I still want to. I’m very passionate about football.”",
      "Amorim was adamant about Fernandes’ position at United in March, when there was a suggestion that Real Madrid could look to sign him.",
      "He said: “No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him.”",
      "Indeed, it looks as though Amorim has got his way, with the huge riches at Al Hilal failing. Whether a big European side approaching for Fernandes would have an impact is a different story, but Amorim would clearly be against that.",
      "The midfielder was clearly happy to listen to his boss on this occasion, so United will hope any other approaches are met with the same mindset.",

      "Ex-Arsenal defender Keown understandably isn’t convinced. Former Sporting CP boss Amorim hasn’t had a pre-season or a summer transfer window yet but United’s results do have to speak for themselves to some degree and finishing in the bottom six of the Premier League isn’t going to be anywhere near good enough next season.",
      "“I’m still concerned that maybe this isn’t the right manager for Manchester United,” Keown told talkSPORT. “Just look at the number of games they’ve lost.”",
      "The three-time Premier League champion has a point.

      "“It’s going to be a very interesting start to next season for them but they could do a lot worse than go and get Jurgen Klopp to manage their football club,” said 58-year-old former England international Keown.",

Yet he remains in-post, as yet untempted by some of the most attractive managerial jobs in world football.",
      "Ratcliffe would surely love to find a way to bring the former Borussia Dortmund boss in to replace Amorim but if Klopp is to be dragged back into the dugout, a hiding to nothing that comes with the added bonus of upsetting every Liverpool fan on earth probably isn’t the job that’ll do it.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",

      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",
      "However, Neville took a different view in regards Kobbie Mainoo, with the 20-year-old's future reportedly also in doubt.",
      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Matheus Cunha set for Man Utd after they triggered the £62.5m release clause in the Brazil international's contract at Wolves; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wanted to play at Old Trafford and was not deterred by their failure to qualify for the Champions League",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",
      "Cunha leaves Wolves as a club-record sale after United met his £62.5m release clause, agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."
