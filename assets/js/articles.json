The Red Devils announced the signing of their newest star but highlighted he would join Lausanne-Sport of the Swiss Super League on loan after signing his contract.",

      "\"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this,\" the young defender said to Paraguayan press. \"When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",

Brazil's style-masters of the 1970 World Cup complete the prestigious top three, staking their claim as another unforgettable international powerhouse.

      "Manchester United have discovered what it'll take to finally sign Jarrad Branthwaite. Branthwaite, 23, was the subject of two bids from United in 2024, with the Red Devils' second offer worth a total of £50million.",
      "Everton rejected both proposals, valuing the defender much higher. After helping the Toffees soar away from the relegation scrap and cement their Premier League status last season, Branthwaite has signed a new five-year contract, putting him among the Merseyside club's highest earners.",
      "The deal keeps him at Everton's new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock until 2030. But they'll be powerless to stop Branthwaite from leaving if a club actives his release clause and agrees personal terms - as United reportedly did a year ago before they turned to Leny Yoro.",
      "According to the Mail, his new contract includes an exit clause worth more than £70m which becomes active next summer. Branthwaite is happy working under Toffees manager David Moyes but has ambitions of playing Champions League football and breaking into the England squad.",
      "The 23-year-old made his senior debut for the Three Lions in June of last year before missing out on Gareth Southgate's squad for the European Championship. Branthwaite is yet to receive a call-up since Thomas Tuchel was appointed.",
      "But the centre-back's stock has remained high, with Tottenham said to have considered making an approach earlier this summer. The former Carlisle United prospect was also linked with a sensational move to Real Madrid during ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti's tenure which ended in May.",
      "For now, though, Branthwiate is firmly focussed on helping the Toffees get off to a successful start in their new home after leaving Goodison Park. \"I'm over the moon. It's been something we've been talking about since the end of the season and to get it signed now is something I'm really excited about,\" he told club media.",

Since then, United have failed to challenge for the Premier League and ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish since they were relegated in the 1973/74 campaign.",

      "Asked if envisaged United not winning the Premier League for 12 years, Vidic said: “No chance. My feeling is that Sir Alex Ferguson left but so did David Gill as well – that’s two big personalities who had been with the club for 25-years.",
      "“They’re difficult to replace and Ed Woodward taking that position, I think was above his knowledge and his capability – that’s my opinion. Obviously, he did fantastic for the club in terms of the marketing and bringing money in, but dealing with agents and players, that role needs someone with experience.",
      "“Even having some ex-footballers around to understand how the players think and how the agent thinks [would have helped]. At the time, the club didn’t help themselves in terms of not bringing in the knowledge of ex-players like Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, or Ryan Giggs – someone who has experienced talking with agents.",
      "“I think sometimes with the salaries and the money we’ve paid to certain players, we’ve been cheated. That for me is the problem. Recruitment is the biggest thing, bringing in good football players, coaches, medical staff, and I think that they should be careful with what kind of people they bring into certain places.",

      "“It’s difficult to be at United now, to be a football player or the owner – whatever you do, it’s difficult so if you want to change the club, the club has to bring in the characters. If the characters aren’t in the club, it is difficult, and you will go through this situation.",
      "“If you bring in people who are going to be nice, smiling, and saying things that you want to hear, I don’t think that’s the way forward. You need people who will take responsibility and be strong enough to say the things they see, even if they have to deal with the consequences.”",
      "Vidic, who took his coaching badges while playing for United but who has so far resisted the lure of returning to work in football, claimed players have too much power these days, which makes it even harder for managers.",
      "“Football players have too much power and because of the money involved, the owner respects the opinion of an agent and player more than the manager,” said Vidic. “That’s the issue we have now. If you have a strong character and personality and have a conflict with a player now, I think the coach will be the one to leave the club.",
      "“This is the era of a new generation of a manager who needs to be careful with how they talk to players – to be a psychologist. You cannot treat all players the same, or owners, and fans. Sir Alex Ferguson was great at this, but it’s even more difficult now.”",

      "However, the journey to securing Mbeumo's services has been far from plain sailing, given United have already seen two initial bids for the 25-year-old rebuffed by the Bees after failing to meet their valuation. Now the Old Trafford top brass are set to launch an improved third offer exceeding £60million to finally get a deal over the line - although there's no guarantee Brentford will agree to sell at the new price.",
      "Ferdinand, whose time at United spanned an impressive 12 years from 2002 to 2014, has labelled securing Mbeumo an essential move ahead of the upcoming campaign to stave off potential ridicule. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the ex-defensive stalwart said: \"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United.",
      "\"So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn't seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",

      "\"It's gone public, they've allowed that to happen, and they're in a position now where they've got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.\"",
      "On why Mbeumo is a top fit for the club, Ferdinand added: \"He fits the bill for me physically. He's dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.\"",
      "Regarding Brentford's stance, the club reportedly want at least £65m to let their star winger leave this summer. Director of football Phil Giles has said on the matter: \"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised. He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer. If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Mbeumo had a stellar 2024/25 season with the Bees, netting 20 goals and setting up eight more in 38 Premier League games. As his contract with the club runs until next summer, with an option for Brentford to extend it for another year, the board are not under pressure to sell unless they receive an offer that meets their valuation for the Cameroon international.",

      "Manchester United have taken steps towards revamping their scouting department as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s push to change the way the club operates. Ratcliffe has been on a crusade to cut costs since taking control of the club in February 2024 and views recruitment as one of the areas that most needs addressing.",
      "Since INEOS took control of the club, there have been a huge number of redundancies across the board – and the scouting department is no exception. The idea is to streamline the previously bloated department by better utilising data, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell at the helm.",
      "Vivell joined in February last year and has won support of the INEOS decision-makers through his work behind the scenes. Director of scouting Steve Brown, who was hired in 2016 by ex-football director John Murtough, has now left the club, with many other scouts following suit.",
      "Just a few years ago, United used to use around 140 scouts. That number dropped to 80 earlier this year and is expected to be reduced even further, with a change in structure being implemented from the top down.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that ‘sports intelligence agency’ Sportsology is now working on United’s behalf to find new hires. The London-based consultancy is looking for a head of senior recruitment, a head of emerging talent and several other senior roles, who will report to Vivell.",
      "A report from earlier this year showed that United have racked up a staggering net spend of €1.3bn (£1.08bn) since 2015 – more than any other club in the world – without seeing the benefits on the pitch. They have not won the Premier League since 2013 and will be without any European football in 2025/26, having finished 15th and lost the Europa League final.",
      "They have already splashed out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and are negotiating the transfer of Bryan Mbeumo, who will cost north of £60m. A squad overhaul is planned, with the departures of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho helping to fund further arrivals.",

      "\"It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.”",
      "He added: \"I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.\"",

      "\"If I was Eddie Howe, Mbeumo would be one of the first I’d want through the door. By signing him, you’re harming Manchester United, you’re taking a brilliant player away from Brentford, and you make your squad better too. There’s three ways to win by signing him, even though I do think he’ll still go to Manchester United. He’ll be a brilliant signing.\"",
      "It would be a huge blow for those at Old Trafford, after all their efforts, they missed out on Mbeumo. Currently the only player they've signed this summer is Matheus Cunha. Mbeumo and Brentford have become frustrated with the slow progress of a potential deal involving the Manchester outfit. The Bees are holding firm over their asking price and are open to other offers for Mbeumo as United weigh up a third bid.",

      "His exit brought to an end a two-decade association with the club having progressed through their academy to make over 250 first-team appearances. McTominay’s sale was thought to have been a boost to United’s PSR calculations given any fee they received would have represented pure profit.",
      "Despite the circumstances of his departure, McTominay has said that he does not harbour any ill feelings towards his former club. He said: “I always want the absolute best for Manchester United. It’s been my life for 22, 23 years so for me, I wish the club all the success in the world.",
      "“I’m with them every step of the way. I want them to do well. I’m not someone who doesn’t want that.”",

      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also a vocal critic of McTominay’s sale. Speaking to the BBC, he said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",

      "Southampton would consider selling Tyler Dibling for a lower price than previously reported with Manchester United and several other Premier League clubs interested in the talented young attacker this summer.",
      "Dibling, 19, was one of the few shining lights in a turbulent 2024-25 campaign for the Saints, who were relegated with just 12 points. And, naturally, interest in the England youth international has been rife from clubs who are eager to keep the fleet-footed teenager in the top-flight.",
      "It was suggested amid rumours of interest from the Premier League's big boys that Southampton would demand a staggering £100million for their homegrown star.",
      "But it has now emerged, via Sky Germany, that Dibling would be available for a sum between €55million (£47m) and €65m (£56m) - a significantly lower amount than previously claimed.",
      "United are said to be one of four Premier League clubs courting Dibling this summer, though Southampton have not received any 'concrete' approaches for the youngster.",
      "There has been plenty of inquiries from interested parties and Tottenham are another club who have been credited with an interest in the youngster in the past. They are now under new manager with Thomas Frank at the helm and seeking quality reinforcements for the upcoming season, where they will return to the Champions League.",
      "West Ham and Nottingham Forest are the two other teams who hold a keen interest in Dibling. The latter have just sanctioned the £55m sale of Anthony Elanga, who is poised to join Newcastle.",
      "Intriguingly, Tim Steidten, West Ham's former technical director, sang Dibling's praises while speaking to the same outlet.",
      "Steidten feels Dibling is destined to join a Premier League club, rather than a team in a different European league, due to the financial demands of Southampton.",
      "He said: “He is an outstanding player – with that street football mentality, that special dynamism. He is a player who can suddenly stop, turn, and accelerate again. His first touch is exceptional. He has immense potential.",

      "Manchester United will be left “embarrassed” if Tottenham beat them to the signing of £65million target Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have had two bids for Mbeumo rejected by Brentford, who are holding out for £65m for their Cameroon forward. As it stands, United are £2.5m short of that figure, which has left the door open for Spurs to move for Mbeumo and reunite him with former Brentford boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Although Mbeumo is holding out for a move to United, Spurs have still not given up on landing him, with former Old Trafford star Paul Parker warning his old club they face humiliation if the 25-year-old moves across London.",
      "“It’ll be very embarrassing for Manchester United if they can’t get the deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line,” Parker told Gameshub. “That said, I do think they will get the deal done, I think it’s clear that Old Trafford is his preference.",
      "“If they don’t get him, it’ll be down to the club failing to get the deal down, rather than Mbeumo not wanting to go to Old Trafford.",
      "“Everyone is saying that the pull of Thomas Frank at Tottenham will make him sign there, but he was happy to leave the manager. He wanted to leave Brentford whilst Frank was still in charge.",
      "“We don’t know if Daniel Levy is a fan of his either, he has a big say over the incomings at the football club – that said, they do need something in that front line at Spurs. Heung-min Son has lost that sharpness and they’re lacking in that frontline.”",
      "Parker also claimed United striker Marcus Rashford has “burnt his bridges” at the club and must seek a fresh start elsewhere to restart his career, after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "“Rashford must move on from United and prove himself once again,” said Parker. “I think he’s got that inside of him, there’s still a fire in his belly, but he must prove it to himself.",
      "“It’s clear he doesn’t have the appetite to play for United anymore and it’s a shame, but that’s how it’s become. It doesn’t seem like anyone really wants to touch him now. He’s had his people working for him, trying to sell him and say how well he was playing for Villa when in my mind, he wasn’t.",
      "“Players like Jacob Ramsey and Ollie Watkins were dropped in place of him, I’d of been unhappy with that. He's burnt his bridges at Old Trafford, there’s been people that supported him, he’s a local boy and they’re the ones who are going to back you.",

In addition, Lord Coe’s proven leadership and track record in delivering transformational projects will be invaluable as we work together to turn our collective vision into reality.",

      "When Manchester United appointed Ruben Amorim as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, few players in the squad stood to benefit more than Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The midfield enforcer, who had joined United from Paris Saint-Germain just over two months earlier, worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, racking up 85 appearances under his stewardship during his time in the Portuguese capital.",
      "Ugarte had arrived at Old Trafford from the Parc des Princes with the task of providing United's midfield with some much-needed defensive nous.",
      "Despite an excellent debut season at United in 2022/23, Casemiro regressed the following season, making the addition of a defensive-minded midfielder a leading priority for the 2024 summer transfer window. United spent several weeks in negotiations with PSG and eventually signed Ugarte on deadline day last August.",
      "After confirming Ugarte's arrival for an initial fee of £42.3million, former United sporting director Dan Ashworth said of the Uruguayan international: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer. He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.",
      "\"His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "Evidence of that was on show in the latter stages of Ten Hag's tenure when he appeared reluctant to select the former Sporting midfielder. He played just seven times under the Dutchman prior to his exit on October 28, making just three starts, of which only one of them was in the Premier League.",
      "It meant the appointment of Amorim felt significant in Ugarte's hopes of nailing down his place in the team. Many anticipated he would join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",
      "Despite playing 34 times between Amorim's arrival and the end of the season, Ugarte's omission from the starting line-up for the Europa League final and the Premier League finale against Aston Villa felt telling.",
      "Casemiro got the nod against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, starting in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes. Ugarte failed to make it off the bench that evening.",
      "Throughout his debut season at Old Trafford, United fans saw the good and the bad of Ugarte. They witnessed how he has the credentials to maintain order in midfield out of possession, helping United keep their shape and win possession back, but they also witnessed flaws in his game when in possession.",
      "Unlike in France and Portugal, Ugarte is not blessed with as much time on the ball in the Premier League. The division is played at a frantic pace and you need eyes in the back of your head.",
      "As a defensive shield and midfield battering ram, Ugarte offers all of the varying qualities you need to fulfil that duty. On the ball, though, he is far from perfect, meaning it is easy to understand why United want to sign a midfielder this summer who can offer a little bit of everything.",
      "However, amid United's desperate need to strengthen their attack, the addition of a midfielder might be put on the back burner.",
      "Fernandes is poised to occupy one of the two No.8 spots and he will need a defensive-minded operator alongside him to ensure United maintain a sense of balance in midfield.",
      "Ugarte is best qualified to offer that defensive nous, but he must raise his game if he is to make one of the two central midfield spots his own. As a result, pre-season will be vitally important for him this summer.",
      "He joined United on August 31 last year, meaning he was thrown in at the deep end. Adjusting to a new club is hard enough, but when you join a club of United's stature, and are tasked with the challenge of fixing the team's biggest weakness, the job becomes even harder.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt this summer, Ugarte should be all the better for it. If he makes the most of it, there is no reason why he cannot reach his best levels under Amorim again."

      "If one decision summed up the closing stages of Erik ten Hag's Manchester United tenure, it was his call to start Toby Collyer at left-back against Barnsley last September.",
      "United welcomed the League One side to Old Trafford in the third round of the Carabao Cup as overwhelming favourites to progress to the next round. The Reds got the job done with minimal fuss, winning 7-0.",
      "It was the perfect opportunity for Harry Amass to be given his competitive debut. He impressed on last summer's pre-season tour, producing a crop of eye-catching performances, and the stage was set for him to make his Old Trafford bow.",
      "Instead, Collyer - a central-midfielder - started on the left of the back four. The decision did not go down well.",
      "Left-back was often Ten Hag's blind spot. The signing of Tyrell Malacia was questioned, the loan addition of Sergio Reguilon aged terribly, and the Dutchman even tested the water by deploying defensive-midfielder Sofyan Amrabat in that role.",
      "On the same day United signed Reguilon and Amrabat on loan from Tottenham Hotspur and Fiorentina respectively, Alvaro Carreras was sent out on loan to Granada. He had spent the previous season on loan at Preston North End, winning their 2022/23 Young Player of the Season award.",
      "His performances in the Championship at Deepdale often earned plaudits from North End supporters. Many felt he was destined to go onto achieve bigger and better things.",
      "United felt the most logical next step in his career was to send him to Granada, who had just been promoted back to La Liga. He struggled for game time in Spain and moved to Benfica in January, signing on loan for the remainder of the season.",
      "The attack-minded full-back, who is equally capable as a wing-back, got into his stride in Portugal and made 16 appearances, scoring one goal. His performances convinced Benfica to sign him on a permanent basis in May last year.",
      "They triggered the option to turn his stay into a permanent one, and United banked a guaranteed payment of around £5million. At the time, it felt like a good deal for United, as they secured a cash-injection for a player that had never made a first-team appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "On the flip side, United said farewell to a promising defender who had done more than enough during his time at Preston and Benfica to suggest he had something about him. That something has now put him on the cusp of a move to Real Madrid.",
      "The Spanish club has been tracking Carreras' signature for a while and it now appears as though a deal is closer than ever to coming to fruition. It has been reported that he is closing in on a move to the Bernabeu for £43m.",
      "Wisely, United inserted a sell-on clause into the deal that took Carreras to Benfica. They also inserted a buy-back clause which is understood to be active until the summer of 2026, allowing them to re-sign him for around £16m.",
      "United are understood to be in line to receive 20 per cent of the profit Benfica make on the Spaniard, meaning, they will secure a little under £6m.",
      "With the club in desperate need of cash this summer, every revenue stream will be welcomed. However, it is impossible to turn a blind eye to how badly this situation has aged for United.",
      "Carreras established himself as a regular starter for Benfica last term, making 52 appearances, scoring four goals and contributing five assists. He made ten appearances in the Champions League and did not look out of place.",
      "As a result of his performances at the highest level, Madrid are now making progress in their quest to sign him. His attacking nature allows him to play pretty much anywhere down the left, meaning he has versatile qualities Madrid will welcome with open arms.",
      "Their pursuit of him will benefit United financially, but Ten Hag's refusal to give him a chance has left them short of a quality player on the pitch who could have so easily excelled in Ruben Amorim's system."

      "Reports have speculated that Carreras could be set to join Madrid for €50million (£43million), the value of the left-back's release clause at Benfica. If this was to be the case, United could be entitled to as much as £4.3million with a 10 per cent sell-on clause or £8.6million with 20 per cent.",
      "If United are merely entitled to a percentage of any profit, that would see the figures decrease marginally. A 10 per cent sell-on clause would see United given £3.8million - and a 20 per cent clause would result in a £7.6million bonus for United.",
      "If Carreras does go on to join Madrid and United receive a sell-on clause value, it could be part of a double transfer windfall for the club. Ex-United winger Anthony Elanga is reportedly close to joining Newcastle in a £55million deal.",
      "United sold Elanga to Forest last summer for £15million - but did include a 20 per cent sell-on clause for any future profit. That means United could receive as much as £8million if Elanga does go on to complete a move to St James' Park.",
      "Combined, it's possible that United may receive as much as £16.6million from two deals that don't involve any of their own players. These funds could go a long way to helping the club complete their own transfer business this summer."

      "Several players continue to be linked with Manchester United and the current focus is to secure a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "So far, United have signed Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon from Wolves and Cerro Porteno respectively. New additions will likely have an influence on how the Reds' 2025/26 season pans out after a disappointing campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, and Christian Eriksen have all departed the club on free transfers. Evans has retired from playing and taken up a new role as United’s head of loans and pathways, while Lindelof and Eriksen are set to pursue new challenges elsewhere.",
      "Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest headlines from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "AS Roma are 'expected' to come forward for Rasmus Hojlund in the coming days, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio. The Italian giants are looking to sign a new attacker following the departure of Tammy Abraham to Besiktas.",
      "It's claimed that Hojlund is among the profiles being monitored by Roma and they are set to approach United over a potential transfer in the 'next days'.",
      "The Reds reportedly value the 22-year-old at £39million (€45m), which is considered to be a figure 'too high' for Roma. The report suggests they could look at the loan option.",
      "MEN Sport says: Selling one of the attacking players this summer is perhaps on United's to-do list, given the plans a new striker will be signed. Between Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, it perhaps makes more sense for Hojlund to get more experience elsewhere and potentially raise his value.",
      "If he does leave on loan and does well, as he would likely be one of the main men, then United could be in line to recoup some of the money spent on him if they decide to sell.",

      "He has scored 200 goals in 500 appearances for the Foxes and despite being 38, feels he can still perform in the Premier League.",
      "It is believed that United will only consider the striker if they are unable to bag any of their top transfer targets.",
      "MEN Sport says:As much as Vardy is a respected figure in English football, having enjoyed a remarkable career with Leicester City, the opportunity for him to join United has passed. At 38 years old, bringing him in, especially on a free transfer, would contradict the club’s current strategy of building a younger, more dynamic squad focused on long-term development.",
      "While Vardy’s experience and instinct in front of goal are unquestionable, United appear focused on investing in emerging talent rather than short-term solutions."

      "Storytelling has become one of the areas that football clubs have sought to improve in recent years.",
      "In a competitive marketplace where many major clubs are all jostling to be seen and in the eyes and ears of a global audience, the go-to move has been to create a documentary to allow current and future fans a chance to peek behind the curtain and gain an affinity with the club.",
      "The success of ‘Welcome to Wrexham’, the Disney+ show that has charted the rise of Wrexham under Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney is something many clubs want a slice of, with the popularity of the Welsh side having soared across the Atlantic in the United States and positively impacted revenues to the tune of millions.",
      "Birmingham City, who count NFL legend Tom Brady among their ownership group, will launch their own documentary later this year on Amazon Prime Video, while Amazon’s ‘All or Nothing’ series has been hugely popular in recent years, featuring the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "On Monday it was reported by The Athletic that Manchester United had turned down the opportunity to become the latest stars of the small screen for Amazon, with the call being made to end the talks after boss Ruben Amorim expressed his dissatisfaction.",
      "The report claimed that United executives had been in talks with Amazon for several months with the idea being to produce a documentary on what is set to be a hugely important season for United on the back of their worst in the Premier League era in 2024/25. The money on offer was set to be ‘significantly more’ than £10m and the most money that any team had ever received for an ‘All or Nothing’ documentary.",
      "Despite the on-pitch struggles in recent years for United, the club retains its status as one of the most iconic brands in world sport, and after such a period of tumult, the potential to film what comes next was an enticing prospect to the streaming giant.",
      "In saying no, the club not only misses out on the millions from the deal, but it also reduces its global exposure to audiences at a time when they are going to find themselves out of the European football spotlight. In terms of what that can deliver for the club, it can attract new fans, who build a lifelong connection with the club and become active customers during that period. But the upside wasn’t enough to convince Amorim, and that might not be the worst thing.",
      "By virtue of being Manchester United, every element of what the club does is scrutinised. For Amorim, the 2025/26 season will be one where he has to return the club back to basics to try and address the alarming decline, and for the sake of £15m or £20m, money that could be accrued through player trading, of which United have many saleable assets they can book a profit on, the potential intrusion and impact that may have caused to a squad where plenty have already shown the weight of history and expectation to hang heavy, wasn’t deemed worth the risk.",
      "This was likely a pretty easy no to take for United and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, particularly if it was felt that it would hamper the club’s chances of returning themselves to European football’s elite Champions League group by the end of this season, a feat that would yield far greater financial gains that a documentary would.",
      "But storytelling is only going to become more prevalent, and clubs are going to find more ways to try and find a narrative that has broad appeal, especially as the game continues to become more global and when traditional domestic broadcasting rights are being squeezed.",
      "United know they have reach, that has never been a problem, the issue that they have had for some time is a negative perception of the football club, and that isn’t great for fans, current or future, or commercial partners. The lack of competitive success has come at a time of a succession of PR disasters, such as mass redundancies of non-playing staff in a bid to cut costs.",
      "They will need to present a better image in the coming seasons and it should be no surprise if a documentary forms part of that. But for this coming season, the overriding need for the club to get its house in order behind closed doors and have that reflected through improved performances on the pitch is paramount."

      "The season featured a catalogue of woes that every United supporter will wish to forget as quickly as possible. The hope and expectation is that next season will be much better.",
      "And if Amazon had had their way, they would have had every angle covered. Just as they had done with Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in previous years, they wanted to produce an access-all-areas documentary to offer an insight into what goes on behind the scenes at one of the world's biggest sporting institutions.",
      "However, according to a report published by The Athletic on Monday, secret talks between United and Amazon have been shelved after head coach Amorim expressed fears that it could distract his players.",
      "It has been reported that Amazon's offer 'was significantly more than £10million', meaning United would have banked the largest ever payment for an 'All or Nothing' series.",
      "It is claimed Amorim, who has just embarked on his first pre-season as United head coach, was 'not comfortable with potential intrusion on the first-team'. The documentary would have followed every aspect of the Reds' 2025/26 campaign, meaning team meetings, dressing room exchanges and much, much more would have been under the spotlight.",
      "Every football supporter, regardless of who they support, is guilty and wanting to know about every nook and cranny that goes on inside the corridors of their club, meaning a United documentary would have been insightful. On the flip side, however, it would have opened the door for further ridicule if United were to struggle again next season.",
      "Having failed to qualify for next season's Champions League, United have missed out on several important revenue streams. A successful Champions League campaign can be worth more than £100m, factoring in prize money, gate receipts, sponsorship deals and various other means.",
      "As a result of losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as what it would have otherwise been, meaning they are having to box clever in this summer's window. Progress has been slow thus far, reflected in the Reds' tally of just two new arrivals, and player sales are key to funding new additions.",
      "With that in mind, the chance to bank more than £10m would have had United's decision makers licking their lips. Every cash injection, however big or small, will be welcomed with open arms this summer.",
      "However, United find themselves walking a fine line between the financial side and the sporting side of the operation. The club's hierarchy knows Amorim has got to oversee a serious improvement next season and it is evident the Portuguese chief believes his players will have a better chance of helping the club climb the table without a TV crew following their every move.",
      "To have adhered to Amorim's request shows that United's decision makers are in full support of the former Sporting Lisbon boss. They have put plenty of trust in him and this decision only strengthens their case to show they are backing him in every possible way.",
      "Ensuring everyone is on the same page is a strong recipe for success, and it is vital for any head coach to have the backing of those above him in the chain of command.",
      "The fact United's top brass have backed out of a deal that would have brought in much-needed funds, to ensure Amorim is more comfortable with hopefully overseeing a season of progress, can only be considered as a positive on the sporting side of the operation.",
      "Amorim clearly felt the timing was all wrong for a documentary to be manufactured and his concerns have been noted."

They were tasked with completing a set of pull-ups. Among those involved was Joshua Zirkzee, who experienced problems with a hamstring injury towards the end of last season. Despite being passed fit to feature in the Europa League final, he missed the Premier League finale against Aston Villa and then the post-season tour. Seeing him back on the first day of pre-season is a positive sign.",

The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",

Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now.

The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",

Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.\n2) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs got there in the end, finding an agreement worth £55million with West Ham, who need the money for their own recruitment. Kudus is expected to make the short journey to Spurs on Thursday to go through the formalities.",

      "A European giant will reportedly ‘propose’ to the agents of a Manchester United striker target that his contract should be cancelled, which would surely open up a simple move for the Red Devils.",
      "United have scoured Europe for different striker targets this summer. They know a move for Viktor Gyokeres now won’t be possible, and attempts to land Benjamin Sesko could go the same way.",
      "As such, a move for Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic is being pursued. The Serbian striker cost £67million when Juve signed him in 2022, though it’s recently been suggested that he could be available for as low as £25million.",
      "But at that price, Juve are still not getting sides to bite, and for a player with just a year left on his deal, it’s now or never.",
      "As such, they have seemingly come up with a new way of saving money from Vlahovic. According to insider Gianluca di Marzio, Juve ‘proposes to terminate the contract’ of the striker.",
      "That’s said to be one of the solutions which will be put to his agents when they meet with the club in the coming days.",
      "Indeed, Juventus would get out of paying around €24million (£20.7m) that way, which is just as good to them as offloading him for a transfer fee.",
      "The report states it ‘remains to be seen’ whether Vlahovic will accept that offer or not.",
      "If he does become available as a free agent, United will no doubt swoop for him, and it would be quite an easy route to the transfer, though there’d surely be competition for a player who scored 15 goals last season and two in the Club World Cup.",
      "But United might be stuck with Jadon Sancho – a player they clearly don’t want – if Vlahovic becomes available on a free.",
      "Indeed, the Red Devils are currently said to be in talks with Juve over a swap deal between Vlahovic and Sancho.",
      "Juve are eager to get rid of the high wages of Vlahovic, while United just want rid of Sancho in any way possible.",
      "As such, the swap might actually be better for them, as they’d ship out Sancho and not have to pay a fee for their new striker.",
      "If talks over that swap are still ongoing, it feels unlikely that Vlahovic’s contract will be cancelled, as Juve are keen on landing Sancho, but if things go stale, that might be the route they take, and both clubs would have to go about getting the players they desire in different ways.",
      "Man Utd have begun negotiations to seal a deal for Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic but “are going to end up” with Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is ‘closer’ to securing an exit after ‘taking drastic action’ to secure his desired transfer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ three Juventus stars as the Serie A giants eye Jadon Sancho in a ‘swap’ deal.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to bring Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic to Old Trafford this summer, and it seems the Serbian striker has revealed his stance.",
      "According to reports, one ‘huge problem’ is threatening Manchester United’s hopes of offloading Jadon Sancho, with two clubs interested.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a summer ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt the Portuguese side will ‘listen to offers’ after United’s pursuit was ‘intensified’.",
      "United have been linked with a number of Sporting stars since Amorim took over at Old Trafford last November. Big names such as Viktor Gyokeres, Francisco Trincao, Ousmane Diomande and Goncalo Inacio have been linked.",
      "The chances of most of those stars being landed has now fizzled out, with Gyokeres looking likely to instead join the Premier League with Arsenal.",
      "But there is still a chance that Inacio joins. According to FootballTransfers, United are ‘weighing up’ a summer move for the centre-back as Amorim ‘eyes a reunion’ with the Portuguese international.",
      "After several months of links, the Red Devils are said to be proposing an initial loan deal with an obligation to buy Inacio for €40million (£34.5m).",
      "Indeed, United have ‘intensified’ their pursuit of Inacio of late, as they see him as an ideal player to strengthen their side, and though Sporting have previously resisted, it’s suggested they are ‘now willing to listen to offers’.",
      "Of what value the offers they will listen to are is not mentioned, as fees both above and below what it’s said United are willing to pay have been reported for Inacio in recent months.",
      "There is competition with Borussia Dortmund for the centre-back, but United are said to ‘hold a key advantage’ due to Amorim’s personal relationship with him.",
      "The Manchester outfit’s hopes to finalise a deal for Inacio come after the departures of two centre-backs: Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans.",
      "The former left on a free transfer, while Evans retired to take up a role behind the scenes at Old Trafford.",
      "There are still six centre-backs in United’s first-team squad, but Ayden Heaven is still fresh at 18 years of age, while 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson also has little experience.",
      "Inacio has 16 Portugal caps at the age of 23, has won the Nations League with them, the Portuguese league on three occasions with Sporting, and crucially has knowledge of Amorim’s system.",
      "Given the struggles some of United’s players had in adapting to it, it can’t hurt for the manager to bring on board more players who are going to slot straight in and be able to perform immediately.",
      "Inacio seems quite clearly able to do that, having starred under his former boss previously.",
      "That an access-all-areas documentary about Man Utd next season was given the consideration it was shows again the size of the job before Ruben Amorim…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘confident’ that they will not miss a set deadline as they pursue Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "So far this summer, United have made two signings as they have invested around £65m to sign Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "In recent weeks, United’s focus has been on signing Mbeumo after he scored 20 Premier League goals during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Mbeumo’s current contract is due to expire in 2026, but Brentford can demand a substantial fee as they have the option to extend his deal on the same terms until 2027.",
      "Brentford have remained firm on their asking price after Man Utd lowballed their Premier League rivals with their initial offers, but Ruben Amorim’s side are edging closer to meeting the set valuation.",
      "United are haggling as they are working with a limited budget, which is not helped by their struggles to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "READ: Man Utd transfers held up by ‘clusterf***’ of the past",
      "Earlier this week, a report claimed Man Utd have set a new ‘deadline’ for Mbeumo, as they are ‘keen to have Mbeumo on board for when United leave for their three-game pre-season tour of the US on July 22, where they will play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",
      "There is said to be ‘a cautious optimism at United that a deal can be struck and discussions continue internally over the next steps’, with the report also revealing one key hurdle yet to be overcome.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want – believed to be £65m – however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "‘Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.’",
      "On Antony and Sancho, the report adds: ‘Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger. Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal – but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.",
      "‘Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.’",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has set a new deadline to complete a deal to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd transfer target Bryan Mbeumo is ‘growing increasingly frustrated’ at the lack of progress between the Red Devils and Brentford.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price.",
      "Manchester United have Chelsea and Newcastle to thank for failing to secure the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided a huge update on Manchester United’s pursuit of their next summer signing after they missed a ‘deadline’.",
      "Man Utd have been boosted by a ‘leak’ out of Serie A claiming the Red Devils can pay for a top striker target in ‘two instalments’."

      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",

      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",

      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Kyle Walker is ‘close’ to completing a ‘shock’ move to a rival Premier League club in a ‘significant coup’.",
      "A former Chelsea defender has offered his thoughts on Liam Delap, suggesting he ‘can shine’ with the help of ‘elite’ players like Cole Palmer.",
      "Joao Pedro has joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m. Will Alexander Isak be among them soon?",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford."

      "Including a Liverpool-linked Crystal Palace player and their potential replacement, here are the 10 best centre-backs available to sign this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Ousmane Diomande (Sporting)\nThe Ivorian has previously been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, but looks set for FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen could trigger a transfer domino effect, with the Premier League champions likely to step up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi. If he leaves, Oliver Glasner has to get his replacement right. Diomande would be a coup and a safe option in that regard.",
      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera (Valencia)\nAvailable for around £17million, Mosquera is only 21 and out of contract next year, prompting Arsenal to make an offer to sign him this summer. Valencia said no, but personal terms are already in place for the Spaniard to move to the Emirates.",
      "The one-cap Spanish international played in 37 of Valencia’s 38 La Liga matches last season. In the one game he missed, Carlos Corberan’s side lost 7-1 to Barcelona. He probably knew what he was doing with that 94th-minute suspension-clinching yellow card the week before.",
      "Mosquera is one of the most promising central defenders in Europe and it’s no surprise to see Arsenal interested. He’d be outstanding right-footed cover for William Saliba.",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joins Real Madrid.",
      "Still only 21, Silva has played 140 times for Benfica. Extraordinary stuff.",

      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often. For my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t prise Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",

      "Including Scandinavian starlets Oscar Bobb and Chido Obi, these 10 Premier League youngsters are ready to go out on loan to a domestic rival this season.",
      "",
      "Oscar Bobb (Manchester City)\nA serious injury robbed Bobb of the chance to establish himself at Man City, and now he’s further down the midfield pecking order than his ability and potential deserve. We can’t think of a Premier League player more in need of a summer loan. He needs to play to realise that incredible potential, which will benefit both City and Norway in the long run.",
      "He’s a special player and needs regular first-team football. There’s a strong chance Pep Guardiola looks abroad. Borussia Dortmund seems an excellent fit, though they’ve just signed Jobe Bellingham, while Bayer Leverkusen could also be an option.",
      "In the Premier League, a mid-table side like Everton, Bournemouth or West Ham would make perfect sense. There’s no doubt Bobb improves those teams, and obviously any of those expected to finish below them. If a newly promoted club like Leeds United manage to get the 21-year-old for the season, they’ll be bloody delighted.",
      "",
      "Tyrique George (Chelsea)\nEvil Saka is a cracking player. Effective on the left, right and even through the middle, the 19-year-old winger could hang around and get insufficient minutes at Stamford Bridge, or get regular minutes elsewhere in the Premier League.",
      "From just 10 starts across all competitions, George has scored three goals and made five assists — a pretty impressive return. He started up front against Manchester United in the Premier League after impressing Enzo Maresca in earlier appearances off the bench.",

      "The 18-year-old would surely benefit from being as far away as possible from the Old Trafford dumpster fire. They can learn from the Alvaro Carreras mistake by properly developing Amass and ensuring he doesn’t slip through their fingers with measly buy-back options. They really screwed the pooch there, with Carreras off to Real Madrid as the perfect left-wing-back in Xabi Alonso’s system. Ruben Amorim will be raging.",
      "",
      "Mikey Moore (Tottenham)\nA very positive and confident player who’s ready for more minutes than he’s going to get in this Spurs team. It’s maybe a case of quantity over quality, but there’s a lot of competition for places in wide areas, which makes a loan move a sensible option.",
      "Moore is only 17 and someone Spurs rate very, very highly. Loaning him out at such a young age isn’t crucial for his development, but if it goes well, the upside is gargantuan.",
      "",
      "Vitor Reis (Manchester City)\nCity aren’t completely sold on loaning out Reis, just six months after signing him for £30million from Palmeiras. But it does make sense, doesn’t it, lads?",

      "Similarly to Moore, Obi is at an age where it makes sense to keep him around playing youth football and the occasional first-team minutes. But with no Europa League, there won’t be minutes against clubs from Kazakhstan or a Thursday-Sunday schedule that demands rotation.",

      "Manchester United are really paying for previous mistakes which has left them unable to copper up for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Send your views on this and all subjects to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Man Utd paying for years of incompetence\nThe chickens are really coming home to roost this summer at United. The problems are too well known and widespread to warrant another yet another email about them but this summer’s transfer struggles are hopefully the natural end point of all of the nonsense of the previous 12 years.",
      "Firstly, United have no cash. Despite a relatively healthy PSR headroom for last FY (which must be healthier now we haven’t bought Mbeumo as expected), by all accounts United are running out of actual money to spend and need to sell to buy. This is a result of what now must be considered generational incompetence in the transfer market and a willingness to hand out extreme wages to players of a questionable age or suitability for Our League.",
      "The result of all this is that we can’t simply go around slapping £5M (add extra 0s where appropriate *cough* Anthony *cough*) extra on the table for any player we are interested in. We also can’t afford to take on big, big wages even where a transfer makes good sense for all involved (Osimhen).",
      "Basically haggling every deal within an inch of its life is the reality for United now. There is clearly frustration that United haven’t agreed or walked away from the Mbeumo deal but it seems to me he’s one of two players the club identified and went for early and were working on a deal that we can afford. There’s no way we’ve been speaking to Brentford for a month and we don’t know what the cost is. No, I think we’ve got our backs to the wall and we’re counting the pennies.",
      "I wonder also if this is holding up sales as well. Sell Garnacho for instance and there’s suddenly not quite as much need to be tight on Mbeumo. Brentford will know that and, to quote Van Der Sar, will challenge us to go as high as we can. That’s the right time to walk away.",
      "And on the subject of sales, that’s a massive clusterf**k. Naive from Amorim and the club to think they could publicly exile these players and expect that teams would still be lining up to sign them. The scarcity of cash and Ratcliffe’s wish to monetise everything at the club should mean that these players are treated like assets.",
      "If you want to get rid then fine but lower the price and move on. If you want to maximise your profit, make them look better than you have. Obviously none of the players have really done themselves any good in a United shirt and their loan spells have been a mixed bag. At the moment, everyone knows they’re overpaid and United are desperate to get rid. Not great conditions for a quick sale.",
      "But of course all these issues stem from past mistakes at the club: the distribution of excessive wages after short term performance (Rashford), terrible planning/negotiating (Anthony) and poor man-management (Sancho – all of them?). As with everything United, it’s systemic.",
      "We’re not going to see a United in the transfer market buying predatorily or selling efficiently until we fix the performance of the squad which we can’t do quickly until we’re better in the market. So it’s going to painful for some time.",
      "Be prepared this summer for no striker, centre mid or goalkeeper. This is just the reality for United now. I can live with it if in five years things have very much improved.",
      "As long as we don’t panic buy right at the end of the window…\nAshmundo",
      "",
      "On Arsenal and enTITLEment\nWhy is it that many Arsenal fans, the media and mainly 365 writers seem to have the attitude that Arsenal are simply a step away from the title just because they happened to have finished 2nd in the last few years and that all they have to do is make that ‘slight’ improvement and the title is theirs – done and dusted? Ridiculous.",
      "I’ve seen it insinuated so many times lately. I’m not saying they wont be challenging again – I’m sure they will be up there – but every year every team starts afresh. The league starts on zero points. Being 2nd the previous year doesn’t give you some sort of points advantage going into next season.",
      "Arsenal have not won the title the last few years simply because other teams were better than them and they were never as good as they and many others portrayed them to be. Liverpool won it last year because they were the best team from the kick off. And there is nothing to suggest they wont be the best team again next season. But they like everyone else are starting afresh (though obviously for tragic reasons theirs will be a strange and unusual campaign to start with).",
      "So can we stop suggesting that the title has basically been Arsenal’s for the last 3 years but some nasty teams have taken from them what is rightly theirs please. Thank you.\nShunt, LFC",

      "At first glance, this would appear to be an activity log of my bathroom light switch for the past couple of weeks. But no……… It’s actually a brief summary of “Gyokeres to Arsenal” for about the last hour or so (I jest, but you get where I’m coming from).",

      "",
      "…I can certainly see both sides of the Partey debate, but consider this?",
      "If Arsenal should have dropped Partey before charges were laid, when would he be reinstated to the team if charges never came? It’s been three years. Would five years be enough? Maybe ten?",
      "It’s a fact that false claims have been made in the past (see the Duke lacrosse case in the US – three young men had their lives destroyed without having the chance to defend themselves in a court of law). I make no judgement on this case – but everyone is innocent until proven guilty.\nPete",
      "",
      "…It would appear that Badwolf and Alex didn’t actually read the mail they were responding to. At no point did Josh defend Partey or anyone who commits any act of violence. He merely explained the implications of suspending an employee who had not been charged with a crime. I notice that the aforementioned mail boxers ignored the mail of Michael O in which the Greenwood situation was mentioned and the differences between these two cases were addressed.",
      "What is also being ignored seemingly is that the role of manager is not what it once was. In that they don’t oversee every aspect of the running of a club. I am sure Arteta was aware he was arrested and being investigated. I am also sure he was told that he didn’t have to drop him and that he could continue as normal in attempting to win games for Arsenal.",
      "This idea that he is somehow showing a lack of moral objections to potential sexual assault is just hyperbole and people are just letting football tribalism inform their opinion. This isn’t an ‘Arsenal’ thing and nobody is saying Partey didn’t do anything wrong, just that the legal process needs to be followed.",
      "The BIG issue for me however is the new contract offer, I don’t know what they were thinking there, especially given that they had agreed to sign Zubimendi the previous summer. There was clearly no way to handle this from a PR point of view that would paint Arsenal in a good light, but that was a major misstep.\nAndrew",
      "",
      "…Wow…wow, it’s this kind of “modern” human nature that leaves me with no sympathy for the pain and suffering of others because I know they wouldn’t be bothered about mine either. All it takes is an accusation, charge and boom everybody is out to get you and I guess you can’t be deemed to have said anything logical or even be treated as a human being if you are from Dubai.",
      "People shouldn’t keep wondering why there is so much apathy in the world while they can’t even look at their own behavior, I guess fair trials, logic only matter when you’re the one being crucified.\nJamo, Dub…no wait, Nairobi",
      "",
      "Is it F for Fascism365?\nJeez… this country! A woman was literally arrested at the weekend for holding a placard that said words, and people here want to invoke the UAE’s judicial system. The gall of it. Please climb down, sirs, from atop your mighty and morally upstanding steeds & take stock as this “green and pleasant land” slides into fascism.",
      "And you know, Football365 is part of this. You have been more than happy for a few years now to embrace this anti-Arab stance. It’s just awful. Football365 immediately drops it’s “middle-ground, balanced view” of everything when the Saudi League is the topic of conversation.",
      "You want to highlight that the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia are countries with inherent prejudices and biases – I get it; but we are literally now living in a country with massive prejudices and biases. To be clear, I am not saying they are the good guys and we are the baddies; I just don’t want anyone happily pontificating about those terrible “ragheads”.",
      "On a different matter. I guess everyone involuntarily envisages a particular player when they think of old football kits. I can’t think of Liverpool’s excellent green away kit from 1999-2000 without Patrik Berger. Likewise, Michael Owen for the horrible crew-collar home kit from 1998. Torres with the weird-collared but lovely Adidas home kit from 2007…. Why am I mentioning this now? Diogo Jota is the face I see when thinking of the 2020-21, league defending, Nike number with the green trim on the sleeves and collar. God, I love that man.\nHesh (LFC)",

Dear Stewart may indeed be troll-like, he might certainly be winding people up, he definitely makes outlandish comments that have little basis in fact…but if F365 is going to exclude letters to the Editor on those grounds, the Mailbox will be filled with nothing more than hollow vainglories and tumbleweeds.There is already enough of the former as it is.",

It’s not really that difficult (as I suggested, he rarely provides an opinion backed by any tangible evidence) and the exercise might just require you to improve your own literary prowess. There’s already enough fascistic garbage in this world, let’s not increase it by cancelling out people whose opinions differ from our own.\nGeorge, Little-Edson-on-the-Waters, Spruffleton",

      "Onana was a liability last season and United have been linked with several potential replacements, including Aston Villa star Emiliano Martinez.",

      "“It’s different at Chelsea to Man United, because they’ve got about four goalkeepers but they can go and sign Martinez and worry about what to do with the rest afterwards.",
      "“As things stand, I’d say they’re in a good position to get ahead of United for that deal. The door has been left open so it wouldn’t surprise me to see them make a move.",

      "An access-all-areas documentary was canned long before the cameras started rolling at Carrington, but the fact the idea ever reached Ruben Amorim illustrates how the Manchester United tragicomedy still has a few seasons left to run.",
      "The Athletic reported this week that the Red Devils had been in ‘secret talks’ with Amazon over an ‘All Or Nothing’ series to document next season.",
      "Who the f*** at Old Trafford received that initial proposal and thought it worthy of further consideration?",
      "Yes, we know United are having to tighten their belts and they have made their need to maximise every available revenue stream abundantly clear. Opening their doors to Amazon would have seen them bank in excess of £10million – the largest payment made to any club as a subject of ‘All Or Nothing’.",
      "That amounts to Matthijs De Ligt’s salary for a year, but it would not cover Mason Mount. So while £10million sounds like a lot of money to walk away from, even the secretary or PA who fielded the first enquiry should have recognised that it is a paltry sum to sell what remains of the club’s dignity.",
      "Because given the current state of Manchester United, as likely as not, it could be the biggest sh*tshow Amazon have produced. And they made Beast Games.",
      "You could certainly understand the appeal to Amazon. Barring a sudden and currently unexpected shift in how the team performs and the club conducts itself, Bezos could have Liverpool, City, Leeds fans paying off his wedding with the rush to subscribe among rivals’ supporters. Who of a non-United persuasion would not have paid £8.99 to be a retrospective fly-on-the-wall in recent seasons?",
      "To United fans, though, the most concerning aspect of The Athletic’s story was that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS crew were on board with the idea, as was chief executive Omar Berrada. We can understand the bean-counters’ enthusiasm when it was pitched to them, but Berrada has been credited with more nous in the past.",
      "What face did they expect to show of what is now football’s pre-eminent Banter Club? Have they really been paying so little attention over the last 18 months?",
      "If they have, they must recognise that all that is broken at Old Trafford cannot be fixed in one summer. Certainly not to the point where you would be happy to have everything out on display.",
      "🔴⚪⚫MORE MAN UTD COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Possible Alejandro Garnacho exit route closed as deal agreed for PSV star\n👉 Man Utd slash asking price for Andre Onana just two years after paying huge transfer fee",

Ratcliffe doesn’t come across as a rampant optimist, so perhaps he and his minions really are just naïve and incompetent.",
      "The positive for Amorim is that at least his protest was heard and acted upon. Though the fact he was ever troubled with the proposal must trigger more alarms in the manager’s mind. At least they might drown out the internal screams of a man who often struggles to hide his befuddlement and annoyance at what’s going on around him. The perma-presence of a production crew might have tipped him over the edge.",
      "More worryingly for the manager, the Amazon idea not being given the shortest of shrifts suggests that those above him expect this to be a season in which United show themselves in a positive light. But Amorim has already been denied the one thing that was expected to help him: a full pre-season with a squad he wants to work with.",
      "On Monday, he welcomed one new signing to Carrington among a group he largely tolerates, while giving four players he can suffer no longer a few more weeks off in the vain hope they might find themselves a new club.",

      "He didn’t score in the Premier League until his 15th appearance, finally netting against Aston Villa on Boxing Day before going on a brief run of seven goals and two assists in seven top-flight matches.",
      "Hojlund was poor overall last season, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances as United finished a dismal 15th.",
      "That form has led co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to consider selling the 22-year-old this summer, with interest from Italy — where he scored 10 goals in 34 games for Atalanta in 2022/23.",
      "One of the clubs keen on Hojlund is Inter Milan, who are reportedly looking to bring in the Danish striker on loan. United, however, are said to prefer a permanent deal if he is to leave.",
      "According to Interlive.it, Hojlund is already on the transfer list at Old Trafford, even though he ‘wants to stay’.",
      "Somewhat oddly, the report states that Hojlund would prefer to stay at the club ‘unless the Red Devils decide to put him on the market’ — but claims they already have.",
      "Also available for transfer this summer are Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana — both, like Hojlund, signed by former manager Ten Hag, who was sacked last October.",
      "As current boss Ruben Amorim looks to rebuild the squad, the report suggests Hojlund is one of the players he could ‘do away with to make money and put into practice yet another revolution’.",
      "Inter’s preference is a loan deal, potentially with a conditional obligation to buy, and the report adds that they haven’t ‘interrupted contact’ with the intermediary working on the deal.",
      "According to what has been collected by Interlive.it, in fact, it has been a while since the Nerazzurri have interrupted contact with the intermediary who was following the operation.",
      "Inter were working on a loan deal with the right or conditional obligation to buy. In this sense, however, an opening from Manchester had not yet arrived.",
      "The INEOS company is aiming for a permanent sale, see the negotiation for Sancho with Juve, precisely because it wants to get rid of those who are not part of the plans immediately.",
      "For Hojlund he asks for something like 45/50 million euros (£38.8-43.1m). After all, he spent almost twice as much to snatch him from Atalanta in August 2023.",
      "Because Inter have abandoned (at least for now. If Thuram left…) the Hojlund track? Because, as is well known, he decided to keep Pio Esposito who at the Club World Cup – for the little he played – proved to be a footballer already up to the situation.",
      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",

      "United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.",
      "There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",
      "United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.",
      "The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.",
      "Rashford's preference is a move to Barca, who have explored the conditions of a deal, but they have other targets in that position too such as Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "Williams has signed a new contract at Athletic Club and Liverpool have rejected all approaches for Diaz, however.",
      "Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger.",
      "Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal - but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.",
      "However, for United to consider another loan this summer, it is thought they would want an obligation to buy him attached.",
      "The Betis president has admitted a permanent deal is difficult to do given the finances involved.",
      "Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.",
      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
      "Juve have other targets, including Porto's Francsico Conceicao, however, and Sky in Italy are reporting that the Portugal international is their preferred choice.",
      "Conceicao was on a season-long loan in Turin last season and, until and including July 15, his release clause is €30m, which Porto want paid up front in full, although it goes up to €45m on July 16.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
