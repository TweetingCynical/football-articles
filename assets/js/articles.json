      "Gary Lineker wants to see a change in Premier League rules after Richarlison was shown a yellow card for celebrating his goal for Tottenham against Manchester United by removing his shirt. Spurs were on the brink of securing only their fourth Premier League home victory in 2025 when the Brazilian found the back of the net.",
      "However, Matthijs de Ligt managed to score a dramatic equaliser at the last minute. Earlier, Mathys Tel had levelled the scoreline after Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Richarlison then thought he had won it for Spurs and celebrated his goal by taking off his shirt.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, Lineker expressed that although it was an imprudent act by the ex-Everton player, it's high time the rules were revised.",
      "He stated: \"Richarlison thought he'd won the game for Tottenham, didn't he, ripping off his shirt, and then obviously they get extra time for that, and then they're scoring that extra time.\"",
      "\"I think it's a stupid law to get a yellow card, and obviously, if it happens in injury time, you get extended injury time. But also, even though it's a silly law, you know what it is, and I just don't understand why.",
      "\"I know you can get overexcited, but you can get overexcited by doing something else other than rip your bloody shirt off.",
      "\"It's a bit daft, but I get it. It's a big goal for him, and he thought at the time he'd won the game. But I mean, honestly, footballers, Micah.\"",
      "Micah Richards chimed in: \"You know what? I can't even grumble at the fact that he's taking off his shirt, because he's playing it in real life. I feel that way on Fantasy Football, so I understand you.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's last-minute equaliser, Spurs boss Thomas Frank said: \"A lot of things we could have done a bit better, the last one is all about the urgency, maybe don't give the cross away and defend better.",
      "\"Second half we got more bite in the man to man pressure, which was not working as it should have been in the first half.\"",
      "Frank added: \"Of course it's not that I'm going away from here and not being disappointed at leading with one minute to go and you don't win, that will always be the case.",
      "\"What I'm focussing on is especially that the second half was a good performance. I was very happy with the way we turned it around.",
      "\"We stayed in the game, did the right thing, keep pushing - in a game when two teams neutralise each other you don't create too much, that's natural, but how the boys kept fighting was hugely impressive.\"",

      "Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek has demanded that Manchester United break their silence on Benjamin Sesko's injury after accusing the Red Devils of a 'lack of respect'.",
      "The Slovenian striker, who came on as a substitute against Spurs at the weekend, was forced off after less than half an hour. United medical staff treated him, with boss Ruben Amorim suggesting that the Slovenian had picked up a knee injury and was due to undergo further testing.",
      "With the international break on the horizon, Slovenia boss Kek wanted Sesko's services to call upon, but has had no update from United officials as of yet.",
      "\"With all due respect to a great club like manchester-united-fc>Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents,\" said Kek.",
      "\"We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don't have just anyone in this position.",
      "\"I cannot comment, of course I have certain information, and I am also in contact with Beni, of course.",
      "\"I can't say anything because officially we don't know anything at all. United haven't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player; the only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",
      "\"We are prepared to do everything for that, and we have never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk. However, the national team is something very special, and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League.",
      "\"After all, it has been quite some time since England defeated Slovenia, and that in itself says something about us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko's international teammate Andraz Sporar has revealed that the forward has yet to link up with the Slovenia squad ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden.",
      "He said: \"Regarding Beni, we don't have any information about his knee injury. I hope it's nothing serious because we really need him for these two matches. I doubt he'll come, but I hope it's nothing serious, also because of his career.",
      "\"We will definitely miss him, because he's a really high-quality footballer. But football is a team sport and we, who will be on the field, will have to do everything to enjoy it.\"",

      "Injury to Benjamin Sesko could leave Manchester United with a dilemma in the coming weeks. The summer signing came off the bench against Tottenham before leaving the Red Devils down to 10 men when he suffered a knee injury late in the dramatic draw.",
      "It remains to be seen how severe the Slovenian international's issue is, but United may yet be left with a decision to make. Sesko is the side's only out-and-out striker.",
      "Ruben Amorim chose to start with a frontline of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, and has previously utilised Mason Mount up front. Mbeumo, United's top scorer, will soon head to the Africa Cup of Nations and the Portuguese coach could soon find himself short.",
      "The 40-year-old has admitted that a January move will come under consideration. \"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "The Serbian forward is a free agent at the end of the season with the likes of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Tottenham looking at the opportunity to sign a deal, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. Manchester United have been linked to the 25-year-old in previous windows, and making an early move could see the Red Devils beat competition for his signature.",
      "Vlahovic is still featuring for Juventus, who are struggling this term, and has scored six goals in 15 matches. The Italian side may be keen to bring in a fee but would be losing a starting striker.",
      "Manchester United have been described as 'most interested' in Vitor Roque's signature ahead of a number of prospectors. It is said the forward's entourage are expecting bids worth €44million (£38m) in the January transfer window as clubs lurk for the Palmeiras striker.",
      "The forward has bagged 13 goals in 28 games since returning to the Brazilian side from Barcelona. Roque, 20, cost around £22m earlier last year, making him the most expensive player in South American football history.",
      "Ollie Watkins has not had a season that would often spark transfer rumours. The forward missed out on the most recent England squad, having recorded just one goal in 11 Premier League appearances.",
      "United have been linked before and VIlla have seemed to be open to offloading their striker before. Price has proved problematic in the past but perhaps Watkins' form could give the Red Devils an advantage.",
      "The Midlands side are reportedly in the market for a new 'top-class' striker already and Watkins would fit United's desire for Premier League experience if they are ready to splash the cash again.",
      "Real Madrid forward Endrick, 19, appears on course for a January transfer. The Brazilian is said to be on course for Lyon in the winter window, with their Portuguese manager proving advantageous due to sharing a language.",
      "United are not on the verge of a move but Amorim could offer the same help in adaptation. It would allow United to make use of a loan which may be more fitting for their current situation too.",

      "Marcus Rashford was hailed by Barcelona fans following his stellar performance in their 4-2 victory over Celta Vigo, where he provided two assists for Robert Lewandowski. The 27-year-old has now amassed 15 goal contributions in 16 appearances since joining the Catalan giants on loan from Manchester United.",
      "Rashford created two clear-cut opportunities from the left flank in the first half with Celta wing-back Oscar Mingueza struggling before being hooked at half-time. Lewandowski converted one of his crosses into the box, while Lamine Yamal capitalised on another of Rashford's passes.",
      "However, the latter did not count as a direct goal contribution as an attempted interception diverted the ball into Yamal's path. Rashford's corner was later headed home by Lewandowski to complete a hat-trick.",
      "Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good scoring opportunities and received his second yellow card of the season. The booking wasn't due to a bad foul, but rather Rashford because of time-wasting as he slowly exited the pitch when being replaced by Ferran Torres in the 88th minute.",
      "While it may have been a tactic to run down the clock, Rashford's slow departure could also have been due to him soaking up the applause, with the travelling fans all standing to clap his performance",
      "Despite Rashford impressing, it wasn't a flawless display by Barcelona, who conceded two goals for the sixth time this season. However, Flick's side improved significantly in the second half, leading to questions about that specific 45-minute performance.",
      "\"I always think to say something about the experts, former players and coaches, but no, I will not do it,\" the Barcelona boss said with a smile when asked in his post-match press conference if the second period was an example of how to execute his playing style.",
      "\"I'll give you too many things to speak about and it's too much noise! But, yes, for me it's like that. We will analyse this match like we analyse every match and try to make things better. This is our job. Not everything was good; we will speak about this.",
      "\"For me, the most important thing is [the players] have the confidence and belief in what we're doing and the second half is a good example of how we want to do it.\"",
      "Reflecting on the overall display, he continued: \"Yes, [I am satisfied]. I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",

      "Manchester United have been warned that Matheus Cunha may NEVER replicate his Wolverhampton Wanderers heroics at Old Trafford by Tony Cascarino. The Brazilian playmaker completed a £62m move to the club in the summer as United overhauled their attack.",
      "Cunha arrived at United off the back of the most productive season of his career, having struck 17 times last term - 15 of those coming in the Premier League. But Cunha has scored just once so far this season in 11 appearances - that solitary goal coming in a 4-2 win against Brighton.",
      "Former Chelsea star Cascarino believes that Cunha will never quite fulfil his potential at the club after his role was changed by Ruben Amorim, while he also claims that the attacker has had a negative impact on Bruno Fernandes’ performances.",
      "Cascarino said on talkSPORT: “Matheus Cunha, there’s been an exaggeration of how well he’s done at Manchester United. He hasn’t done that well, Yes, he’s done OK and if he can get back to what he was at Wolves (he’ll be a good signing).",
      "“But look at his goals for. He’s got one in the games he’s played. I’m still not sure he’ll ever reach the level he was at Wolves because he carries the ball from the halfway line to the 18-yard box and does it well and brings the team up the pitch but he was a lot more than that at Wolves.",
      "“He had a goal one in every two games at Wolves. Also, Man Utd are suffering because they’ve had to change the dynamics of Bruno Fernandes so it’s come at a little bit of price for Manchester United.”",
      "And while Cunha’s displays have been criticised, Cascarino is also less than inspired by Benjamin Sesko. United also spent huge funds to sign him from German side RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko however has scored just twice since becoming a Red Devil and now appears to be restricted to the sidelines after picking up a knee injury in the recent draw with Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "“He [Sesko] looks like he’s so out of sorts,” Cascarino added. “I think he’s got a bad injury. I think you’re going to find out he’s out for a while.",
      "“I watched him after the pass from Fernandes, he couldn’t get it out of his feet and then it looks like he gets his leg stuck.”",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is outshining Manchester United's Mason Mount this season following the Argentinian international's switch to Chelsea. Garnacho made a £40million move to the Blues in August after a fallout with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim post the Europa League final.",
      "The 21-year-old felt he deserved more game time and voiced his frustrations publicly, reportedly leading to Amorim retorting: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer.\"",
      "The winger's departure from the club was far from amicable, having been at the club since joining the academy in 2020. Now donning the Chelsea blue, Garnacho is starting to hit his stride after an initial slow start in west London.",
      "Mount, who moved in the opposite direction from Chelsea to United, hasn't quite found his feet at Old Trafford as he did at Stamford Bridge.",
      "In fairness, Mount has had his share of injury woes. Five separate injuries have seen the 26-year-old miss over 50 games for United, but when he has featured this season, he has managed just one goal and one assist in nine appearances.",
      "In contrast, Garnacho has netted two goals and provided two assists in his 10 matches for Chelsea. Both assists came in Chelsea's 3-0 triumph over Wolves on Saturday.",
      "United have a regrettable recent history of selling players who then go on to shine at other clubs. One of the most notable examples is Scott McTominay.",
      "Since his £25m switch to Napoli last season, the Scotland international has emerged as one of the Italian side's standout performers. He claimed the Serie A MVP award for the 2024/25 campaign and secured 18th place in the 2025 Ballon d'Or rankings following Napoli's triumph in securing their fourth Italian league crown.",
      "Garnacho's journey at Chelsea hasn't yet reached McTominay's heights. Nevertheless, what unfolds could serve as a harsh wake-up call for Amorim regarding Mount's value to the squad.",
      "United's No. 7 has demonstrated tactical flexibility under Amorim. He has occasionally operated as a left-sided number 10, left-winger, and even as a false nine.",
      "The capacity to switch positions without significant disruption is something the United boss prizes highly given his distinctive formations. Towards the close of 2024, Amorim openly expressed his appreciation for Mount when he said: \"I have to tell you I love that kid.",
      "\"The first thing is he is working really hard. And then you have to understand the human also. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Mount remains young and has ample time to rediscover any form lost this season. His deal with United runs until 2028, and with Amorim already showing his affection for the midfielder, the 26-year-old appears destined for further chances.",
      "But Amorim will surely want to witness some progress in the near future.",

      "It wasn't a faultless display, however, as noted by portions of the Spanish media. But the general reaction to Rashford's crucial pair of assists was positive as Lewandowski, who decided the game with his hat-trick, benefited greatly from the Englishman's input.",
      "Mundo Deportivo was particularly complimentary of the United loanee and described him as \"one of the key players in Vigo.\" And it wasn't only his direct goal contributions that impressed, as his set piece proved potent on the west coast.",
      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one excerpt from the newspaper's report. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same report lauded Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and detailed just how pivotal his pressing proved in off-setting Celta's rhythm. El Pais, meanwhile, highlighted Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The same newspaper hailed the Englishman's \"superb\" cross into Lewandowski for the g-ahead goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept things competitive for most of the first half, and it wasn't long before Borja Iglesias levelled once more before the interval.",
      "It wasn't all praise, though, as Sport pointed out the forward's \"unforgivable mistake\" in missing a clear one-on-one against Celta keeper Ionut Radu. That slip in itself may not have been so terrible were it not for the fact that Carreira scored his equaliser directly from the resulting Celta counter.",
      "\"He had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read the recap of his missed opportunity. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "But another section of the same newspaper put Rashford on a pedestal for the impacts that did hit their mark. And his \"exceptional attacking performance\" was deemed all the more positive considering Lamine Yamal had a faltering first period in Vigo.",
      "\"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match,\" read one passage. \"He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barça 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.",
      "Rashford, who could upset Liverpool's transfer plans in January, heads into the international break having contributed at least one goal or assist in seven of his last eight league starts. And England coach Thomas Tuchel will hope to have this version of the attacker back for the Three Lions' upcoming games against Serbia and Albania.",

      "Liverpool enjoyed an unprecedented summer transfer window but one January plan could be scuppered. Arne Slot has been given lots of ammunition to work with this Premier League season.",
      "After lifting the league title in what was Slot's debut campaign, Liverpool did not rest on their laurels where the transfer window was concerned. They were on track to shatter the British transfer record when Florian Wirtz arrived for a deal that could reach £116million.",
      "But this was soon surpassed when Alexander Isak arrived on deadline day for £125m. Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Leoni also touched down for hefty sums as part of a record-breaking £446m window.",
      "Lyon star Malick Fofana has reportedly been of interest to Liverpool in the past. But a January move for the 20-year-old winger could rely on England ace Rashford.",
      "Rashford is currently on loan at Barcelona and though he starts regularly, some within the club seem not entirely convinced. Barcelona are therefore monitoring some young talents they could recruit if they do not exercise the 28-year-old's £26m purchase option.",
      "Spanish outlet Sport report that Fofana is one of those who the Catalan side have on their radar. He would cost a reported £51.5m if he were to leave Lyon.",
      "In July, the Reds saw themselves linked with a move for the youngster, with speculation suggesting that both Chelsea and Arsenal also hold him in high regard.",
      "Centre-back Ibrahima Konate has been at the centre of some contract speculation this term as his current deal on Merseyside expires in June 2026.",
      "In January, he would be able to sign a pre-contract agreement with another European side and there have been few suggestions of him penning a new contract with Liverpool.",
      "Real Madrid have been the rumoured destination for the France international and reports from Spain have addressed speculation that an agreement has been reached. AS claim that Liverpool have given up on trying to re-sign Konate to a new deal.",
      "But they also state that any rumours about an agreement with Los Blancos are just that and at the moment, the club are simply keeping an eye on Konate and think the situation is positive.",
      "Much has been made of Liverpool's summer activity but one former player thinks that recruits have been handed starring roles too soon. Jamie Carragher took aim at Slot for how he has utilised his new signings.",
      "\"Looking at Liverpool in these last couple of weeks, there may be one valid criticism with hindsight would be about the manager,\" Carragher told talkSPORT.",

      "\"Andy Robertson didn't actually play too much when he first signed, and he was sort of going to the Liverpool team around November, December. Maybe that would be the case with a few of the new signings as well, going forward.\"",

      "Manchester United begin the final international break of the year with mixed feelings following Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham. Matthijs de Ligt struck deep into stoppage time to rescue a point for United, who looked set to claim a semblance of revenge for defeat to Spurs in the Europa League final when Bryan Mbeumo haunted old boss Thomas Frank with a 32nd-minute opener.",
      "But Mathys Tel drew the hosts level six minutes from time. Moments later, substitute Benjamin Sesko was forced to limp off and leave United with 10 men for the closing stages.",
      "Ruben Amorim faced a first loss since September when Richarlison scored in the 91st minute. But De Ligt powered home Bruno Fernandes’ corner with seconds left in north London. It extended United’s unbeaten run to five matches, although the head coach was left wanting more.",
      "Amorim will be feeling far more positive than during the last international break, when there were big question marks over his future. However, the Portuguese coach will be reflecting on what might have been following successive 2-2 draws at Nottingham Forest and Spurs. Here’s a round-up of some of the latest news from Old Trafford...",
      "United can forget about recalling Hojlund from his loan spell. Sesko’s worrying-looking knee injury, sustained after he came off the bench at Spurs, will potentially leave United short up front heading into the winter.",
      "As a result, Amorim may feel compelled to dive back into the transfer market for a striker when the January window opens. However, a return for Hojlund is not on the cards following his loan move to Napoli in the summer.",
      "The reigning Serie A champions are currently second in the table, behind leaders AC Milan on goal difference. Therefore, United have no recall clause available should they attempt to bring him back to Old Trafford in January.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen has lavished praise on United youngster Harry Amass as he looks to extend the defender's loan spell at Hillsborough.",
      "The left wing-back has been a revelation since joining crisis-hit Wednesday in the summer. Amass has made such an impression that Pedersen has already held talks with United officials about him staying in South Yorkshire for the rest of the season.",
      "With the Owls likely to be the subject of a takeover after going into administration, the terms of the deal could change. But it won’t alter Pedersen's desire to hang on to the youngster for the rest of the season.",
      "“I spoke with Kevin [Beadell, United recruitment manager],” said Pedersen. “We have been in Manchester to have a meeting with them about this situation for the future.",
      "“I think we should have this back in the next two or three weeks when we speak about the development from Harry and what it could look like after Christmas.”",

      "Manchester United could reap the rewards of Mason Greenwood's stellar performances at Marseille. The 24-year-old made a permanent move from Old Trafford to France in the summer of 2024, with United cleverly including a sell-on clause in his £26.7million transfer.",
      "Greenwood has proven to be a steal for Marseille, netting an impressive 22 goals in the 2024/25 season. He's already chalked up 13 goal contributions this term, including a Champions League strike. Despite struggling in Europe, Marseille are making waves in Ligue 1 under Roberto De Zerbi, currently topping the table.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain could leapfrog them by the end of Sunday however, with Marseille already winning 3-0 against Brest this weekend prior to the champions travelling to Lyon. Greenwood's pivotal role hasn't gone unnoticed by CIES, the football observatory website that provides data and analysis on players' values.",
      "They regularly update their estimated valuations, and Greenwood's stock has certainly risen. In August, he was valued at a maximum of €57m (£49.3m), with the lowest estimate being €49m (£42.3m).",
      "Just a few months on, his top price is now pegged at €64m (£56.2m), with a minimum value of €57m (£48.3m). Should Marseille eventually cash in on the player for somewhere near that figure, United stand to receive approximately £25million thanks to a shrewd 40 to 50 per cent sell-on clause negotiated by Old Trafford officials.",
      "It's proving to be an astute piece of business by United given Greenwood's impressive displays. Since his departure from United, several other talented forwards have been moved on with Rasmus Hojlund joining Napoli on loan and Alejandro Garnacho sealing a permanent switch to Chelsea.",
      "Marcus Rashford has also made a dream move to Barcelona with Greenwood's fellow academy graduate also impressing in front of goal. Whilst the English winger had netted just once in Marseille's previous five fixtures across all competitions – before converting a spot-kick in Saturday's comfortable 3-0 victory– he bagged four goals in a stunning 6-2 thrashing of Le Havre in mid-October, prompting high praise from De Zerbi.",
      "\"He has what it takes to become one of the best players in the world,\" the manager declared following that performance. \"He's incredibly talented and puts in the work on the training ground.\"",
      "De Zerbi and the Marseille hierarchy clearly rate Greenwood highly, though a departure remains possible, particularly if his exceptional form continues. Links to Italian outfit Lazio surfaced during the summer transfer window, but nothing came to fruition. Interest from European giants like Bayern Munich or Real Madrid pursuing his signature can't be discounted.",

Mainoo has seen his standing at United plummet under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite being a key player last season, the 20 year old has managed just eight appearances this campaign. Amorim has favoured the combination of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in his Premier League midfield, leaving Mainoo to settle for substitute appearances in seven of the opening 10 matches.",
      "With United already knocked out of the Carabao Cup and absent from European competition, Mainoo's playing time looks set to remain severely restricted until January - potentially jeopardising his World Cup ambitions.",
      "A loan switch has been mooted ahead of the transfer window reopening, with Serie A champions Napoli emerging as frontrunners.",
      "Reports previously suggested the Italian giants were prepared to cover his entire wages to secure his services at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.",
      "According to The Sun, McTominay is now pulling out all the stops to engineer a reunion with Mainoo in Italy. The 28-year-old departed United in 2024 and enjoyed a stellar debut campaign, netting 12 goals whilst helping secure the Scudetto.",
      "McTominay is said to have approached Conte directly to push for Mainoo's signature. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source revealed.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "Amorim recently confessed there simply wasn't space for Mainoo in his team. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",
      "\"We are giving a lot of information, we are working on our fitness because we need to keep momentum during the week with good training, really intense.",

      "\"I see Kobbie Mainoo training today, and he deserves to play, but then I have to take one guy [out] that's playing really well. We should have played in the Carabao Cup, because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing, I need to see Josh, all of these guys deserve to play, but in the end, it is one more game you need to make choices.

      "“And it shows you how football can be a really cruel game at times because Kobbie Mainoo was playing, he reached the England national team, he was going up, up, and up. All of a sudden he is not being picked.",
      "\"Now the question is, does he stay positive, patient, and wait for his moment again? Or he needs to move to a different place to play regularly to get his confidence back and come back to United and start playing more regularly?",

I like that. But at the moment, the manager doesn't see something he can use from the first minute of the game.\"",
      "Mainoo, 20, has made 80 appearances for United since breaking into the side in 2022, scoring seven goals. He has made a further eight outings this campaign, albeit only one of those has been from the start. Mainoo has less than two years left to run on his contract with United.",

      "Theo Walcott has jumped to Thomas Frank's defence after Tottenham Hotspur supporters voiced their frustration during the dramatic 2-2 draw with Manchester United. The Danish boss was subject to jeers from Spurs fans when he hauled off Xavi Simons in the closing stages of the match.",
      "The 22-year-old midfielder, who joined the north London outfit from RB Leipzig for £52m in the summer transfer window, made way for Mathys Tel. Moments after entering the fray, Simons' replacement found the back of the net, firing home an equaliser from close range.",
      "A few minutes later, Wilson Odobert, who had been introduced at the interval, set up what many believed to be the winner. Richarlison diverted the 20-year-old winger's curling effort past the Senne Lammens with a deft header.",
      "Frank made numerous changes throughout the game, with some decisions proving more welcomed than others. However, the Dane ultimately breathed new life into his team, and they came within moments of securing all three points.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day on Saturday evening, Walcott called on Tottenham supporters to 'trust the process'. The former Arsenal forward said: \"I don't think the Tottenham fans felt he got the substitutions right when he made them, to be honest.",
      "\"Odobert was absolutely outstanding when he came on. A player who has to be able to take risks and play with that freedom and the energy, and that's what you have to be able to do as a substitute; you need to be able to commit bodies.",
      "\"What I like about him, he likes to put the ball in when you have space, he likes to change his game – and this is what I talk about when I talk about not being predictable – when you give players, who are ball-carriers, in this amount of space, Manchester United start dropping.\"",
      "Frank rang the changes throughout the encounter. He switched Pedro Porro for Destiny Udogie, introduced Rodrigo Bentancur in place of Joao Palhinha, and replaced Kevin Danso with Cristian Romero.",
      "Walcott continued: \"Udogie was fantastic as well, all three substitutions who came on all contributed. It just shows, trust the manager's process.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"I think that's one thing, as fans, when you watch games, you always feel frustrated in the moment, but they are there for a reason. Thomas Frank is a good manager, he knows exactly what he's doing and he's made the right decision.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following the match, Frank reflected on the substitutions he had made. The Spurs boss said: \"Yeah, sometimes you are lucky.",
      "\"But, of course, every single time I take a decision to sub a player it's with one aim - to make the team win or get back into the game or try to see the game out.",

      "England icon Rooney has enjoyed a tumultuous time since his retirement in 2021. He began his managerial journey with Derby County and after a spell with DC United in America, he returned to helm Birmingham City in 2023.",
      "The 40-year-old was sacked after winning twice in 15 matches and his next job would come with Plymouth Argyle. There, he would endure a similarly demanding spell and was relieved of his duties in January 2025 after earning just two points from 13 league games.",
      "Since leaving Plymouth, Rooney has turned his hand to punditry. He penned a deal with the BBC to become a regular Match of the Day studio pundit this summer and is now set for another boost to his wallet.",
      "Rooney is due to receive a substantial tax rebate after liquidating his image rights company. Three years ago, he pocketed around £21million after closing the company, of which he owned 100 per cent of the share capital.",
      "He set up image rights and investment firm Stoneygate 48 Ltd in 2006, but opted to liquidate it as it was \"no longer required.\" Rooney chose to do this after he had retired from playing.",
      "A declaration signed by Rooney at the time reported that he was to receive an expected £20.8m payout from the closure. The last accounts were for the year ended March 31, 2020.",
      "The company's assets consisted of £1m in property, £8.9m in investments and £11.9m in monies owed to the firm, totalling £21.8m. They were offset by ­liquidation costs estimated at £30k, £200k due to HMRC and £750k in other undisclosed bills.",
      "A spokesman on behalf of Stoneygate 48 Ltd said at the time: \"The directors have decided to put the company into solvent ­liquidation as it is no longer required. All debts will be paid in full and money will be returned to shareholders.\"",
      "But before this process is completed, Rooney is now set for another £800k increase thanks to a tax rebate from HMRC. This only adds to his already astronomical net worth.",
      "Rooney's current fortune stands at an estimated £170m. This would make him the world's wealthiest manager and has been bolstered over the years by his various business ventures. During his playing days, it was estimated that Rooney earned upwards of £300k per week. In addition to a lucrative salary, he also penned brand deals with the likes of Nike, Coca-Cola and EA Sports.",
      "His most recent boost came via his BBC contract. It is thought this two-year deal is worth a total of £800k. Although it may complicate any return to management, speaking last month Rooney was honest and admitted that as of now he is comfortable in punditry.",
      "\"No, not really,\" Rooney told talkSPORT when asked if he was in search of another coaching role. \"I'm happy with what I'm doing. I'm still learning in the punditry world and trying to get better at that.",

      "Manchester United have been told that bringing in a new striker this month will come at a hefty price, with suggestions that their focus should shift to other areas of the squad following concerns over Benjamin Sesko's injury. The Slovenian forward picked up a knock during Saturday's 2-2 draw with Tottenham, being forced off after 85 minutes having only entered the fray shortly before the hour mark.",
      "Speaking to reporters afterwards, Ruben Amorim confirmed the injury involved Sesko's knee. \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" the United manager said.",
      "\"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "The blow has turned United's attention firmly towards the January market, with the club possibly requiring reinforcements up front should Sesko face a lengthy spell on the sidelines.",
      "Adding to the setback, Amorim will also be without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui owing to next month's Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" Amorim continued. \"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "He also revealed: \"I was in the press conference and [Ruben] Amorim, as he was leaving the room, he was asked about Sesko's injury so he didn't have time to give a full answer. And he just said 'I'm worried', because when it's the knee, it could be anything.\"",
      "After Amorim suggested during his press conference that the club could buy him 'more midfielders,' Northcroft claimed that would be 'more pressing' for them than signing a new attacker.",
      "He went on to explain that United's long-standing issues have centred around midfield 'for years', describing the situation as 'substandard.'",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho assisted two Chelsea goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers hours after Ruben Amorim voiced his disappointment that Manchester United did not beat Tottenham Hotspur. Garnacho was named in the starting line-up and shone at Stamford Bridge, recording his first two Premier League assists since departing Old Trafford with two crosses from the left flank.",
      "His opening contribution was a precise delivery onto the head of Malo Gusto, who powered it home from close range to give the Blues a lead. The second capped off a devastating counter-attack, teeing up Pedro Neto to find the net against his old club and stretch the advantage to 3-0.",
      "Enzo Maresca heaped praise on the summer acquisition after the final whistle. \"He's doing very well on the ball,\" the Chelsea head coach said, \"but he's doing very, very well off the ball.",
      "\"He knows that to play with us, he has to be good on the ball and off the ball; otherwise, he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "Alan Shearer also highlighted his display on Match of the Day. \"I was really impressed with him. He scored in midweek (against Qarabag in the Champions League).",
      "\"I think it was his best game today. He caused problems all evening down the left-hand side.",
      "\"Whoever was coming up against him, he had more pace than them; he went past them with ease, and he was a real threat in putting balls, good balls, into the box for his forwards, and of course, they benefited from that. I thought he looked really, really comfortable.\"",
      "Earlier that day in north London, Amorim had been criticising United for becoming too relaxed after taking a 1-0 lead at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Bryan Mbeumo put United ahead just past the half-hour mark, but they failed to build on their lead.",
      "Mathys Tel brought Spurs level late on, before Richarlison turned the game around for the home side. Matthijs de Ligt's equaliser salvaged a point, but United had been in front for 52 of the 98 minutes played, trailing for just five.",
      "Amorim admitted afterwards that all three points were there for the taking. \"I think, if you see the game, you feel that the three points were there to take home,\" he said, before adding: \"If you look at the game and if you feel the environment, we have so much to grow as a team, because today was our day to win this game.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think it's more we need to look at ourselves. We were not pressing with the same intensity because we felt comfortable.",
      "\"We need to understand that, but to feel also that, if we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.\" He concluded: \"We need to feel the environment of the game and feel that the opponent is nervous, so we need to kill the game and not wait until the end.\"",

      "Forward Sesko entered the fray from the substitutes' bench in the 58th minute against Tottenham, yet endured merely thirty minutes on the pitch. The striker was withdrawn after a tackle from Micky van de Ven whilst bearing down on goal.",
      "Following medical attention for a knee problem, Sesko made his way directly towards the tunnel. Thankfully, Ruben Amorim's side salvaged a point courtesy of Matthijs de Ligt's dramatic late leveller.",

      "Hojlund remains contracted to United, with the Denmark striker currently on loan at Napoli in Italy. The 22-year- old has netted four times in nine outings for the Serie A title holders.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported that the temporary deal features an option which could transform into an obligation, though those connected to the arrangement consider it 'guaranteed' should they secure Champions League qualification.",
      "This means United have no recall clause available should they opt to engineer his return to Old Trafford during January.",
      "Prior to the Spurs clash, rumours had suggested United were eyeing a new striker to provide competition for Sesko during the campaign's latter stages.",

      "\"He had two really, really good chances and should have scored, to be honest. They worked it really well for him to get in the first time.

      "Danny Welbeck left Manchester United after nearly a decade to join rivals Arsenal and is now a prolific goal scorer for Brighton. The English striker never could've predicted the twists and turns his career has taken since his senior professional debut in 2008.",
      "Welbeck was handed his first start by Sir Alex Ferguson against Middlesbrough in the League Cup and made the majority of his United appearances under the iconic manager. The Red Devils academy star played 142 games for his boyhood club, scoring 29 goals, but appearances declined when Louis van Gaal arrived in 2014.",
      "Welbeck made 33 appearances for David Moyes during his time as manager, but played just three times for Van Gaal out of position, prompting him to seek a new challenge elsewhere. Arsenal made the move on the final day of the summer transfer window and secured Welbeck's signature for £16million.",
      "This transfer was a bittersweet moment for the striker, who had been at Old Trafford since the age of eight, but it was a decision that felt necessary. Discussing the reason he left United, Welbeck said: \"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game.",
      "\"I can play it to the best of my ability but that’s not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.",
      "\"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "The centre forward made 126 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 32 goals - three of which came against his old club in Manchester. Welbeck won two FA Cups with the north London side, working under Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery before being released in 2019.",
      "Watford signed Welbeck on a free transfer that summer, and he scored three goals in 20 appearances before leaving the club just one year later. However, in 2020, a new club came calling in the form of Brighton, and the rest, as they say, is history.",
      "Welbeck is still starring for the Seagulls to this day, scoring six goals in the Premier League already this season. So far, the 34-year-old has made 173 appearances for Brighton, netting 43 goals and assisting 17 times - far surpassing his tallies at United, Arsenal and Watford.",
      "Many wouldn't be able to predict Welbeck's resurgence at the Premier League side, given their typical transfer model that targets young and unproven stars. The veteran striker will be glad that the Seagulls took a chance on him five years ago, as he continues to shine in both domestic and European competition, 17 years on from his debut.",

      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month. However, he was benched against Liverpool at Anfield and failed to score in the next three matches.",

      "Ruben Amorim said the Nottingham Forest draw was two points dropped and the outcome was the same against Spurs last weekend. United would be on the same points as Manchester City if they had won those matches after taking leads. Amorim will be delighted nonetheless with the team's turnaround.",
      "United have made progress and demonstrated the fight they lacked last season by scoring late goals to avoid defeat in their last two games. \"If you can't win, don't lose,\" has been the mantra.",
      "Amorim explained after Tottenham: \"We have a lot of problems, we are just in the beginning, sometimes the results show to people we are improving, but we have a lot to do.\"",
      "The 40-year-old was named the Premier League's manager of the month for October. Three wins on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton were tenure-defining, but United have shipped more goals than Amorim would like, which meant November started with two draws.",
      "The quirk is that Amorim has the most strength in depth in the defensive department, but it's currently the area that is letting the team down. The Reds must tighten up when football resumes after the break.",
      "Tottenham created just 0.05 xG against Chelsea, their lowest on record since Opta started collecting Premier League xG data in 2012/13, but they scored twice against United.",
      "United have conceded 18 goals in the league this season. The teams that are above in the table have something in common: they have made it harder for the opposition to score.",
      "Arsenal have conceded an impressive five goals and City have conceded eight. Chelsea have conceded 11, while Sunderland, Tottenham and Aston Villa have all conceded 10.",
      "Chelsea, Spurs and Aston Villa are competitors for the Champions League places and have stronger defensive records than United. \"It's a problem, especially if you see the league nowadays. The team winning lots of games is not suffering goals, or shots on target,\" said Amorim last week.",
      "\"In one opportunity, you can score a goal and win the game. But I think it's more of a team thing, we need to defend better. We need to be more aggressive. And we defend better when we have more energy. We have a lot to do and cannot suffer the amount of goals we are suffering.\"",
      "The defensive record would be worse without Senne Lammens, who has surprised Amorim with the extent of his impact since his confident debut against Sunderland last month.",
      "Lammens has been excellent, making several important saves. The Belgian international has still conceded seven goals in five games, two more than Arsenal have conceded in the entire league campaign.",
      "Every fan who has watched Lammens will tell you that is certainly not his fault. The blame lies with the team as a collective and Amorim must come up with a quick solution to address it.",
      "At the beginning of the season, club sources outlined that Europe was the target for the campaign, but securing qualification for the Champions League again must be the specific goal.",
      "United must concede fewer goals to achieve that aim and the players must take responsibility, as some individual errors have led to goals. Patrick Dorgu made the foul leading to Danny Welbeck's free-kick goal for Brighton and Joshua Zirkzee lost his marker at a corner for their second.",
      "Diogo Dalot was passive in the build-up to Morgan Gibbs-White's goal for Nottingham Forest and there was a breakdown in communication between Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Casemiro for their second.",
      "Manuel Ugarte allowed Tottenham forward Wilson Odobert to breeze past him last weekend. Ugarte was far too weak and De Ligt was turned by Mathys Tel, who scored the equaliser.",
      "The Premier League is so competitive that fine margins often decide the outcome of games. United must remain concentrated throughout the full 90 minutes - not just for most of the game.",
      "It would be worrying if Amorim had downplayed the number of goals conceded this season, but the United boss is aware of the problem and will be working on the training ground to fix it.",

      "As Spurs broke down the other end of the pitch, Sesko remained on the ground and after being treated by medical staff, there was no alternative but to replace him. Sadly for Amorim, there were no options left after making all five substitutions.",
      "So, United ended the match with ten men, conceded in injury time only for Matthijs de Ligt to save the day. When speaking to the media in his post-match press conference, Amorim could not be more clear on his focus surrounding Sesko.",
      "\"That [his recent form] is not the biggest concern now,\" he explained. \"I'm concerned with an injury, because it is in the knee, and I don't know.",
      "\"We need Ben [Sesko] to be a better team. We have to check. He has something in his knee. Let's see.\"",
      "Heading into the November international break means that Amorim has time to decide on what he will do should Sesko not be fit enough to start against Everton on November 24. MEN Sport believes there are three options to replace the forward and has taken a look at them below.",
      "Undoubtedly the most likely option Amorim will take is the strikerless system which he deployed against Spurs and at Liverpool previously too. Both systems suit Cunha as the 'false nine' essentially.",
      "The former Wolverhampton Wanderers front man has played in the centre-forward role previously at his old club and Amorim has used that versatility at United. On Saturday, there was plenty of hard work from the Brazilian but the end product was not there, which prompted the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Perhaps more interestingly will be the decision Amorim takes in the No.10 roles. We have become accustomed to seeing Bryan Mbeumo on the right, Mount on the left and Amad sticking in the right wing-back position.",
      "However, in north London, United chose to reintroduce Noussair Mazraoui at wing-back, moving Amad further forwards and pushing Mbeumo to the left. This did not mute the power of Mbeumo in the first half, he remained a threat but United were perhaps not as dangerous attacking with the more defensive-minded Mazraoui on the right.",
      "This will be something for Amorim to consider should he adopt those selections again.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee finds himself firmly on the fringes of the first team at present. No wonder then that MEN Sport understands he will request a transfer by January.",
      "The Dutchman's hopes of a call-up to his national team squad for the World Cup are fading by the week and the longer he spends on the bench, the worse it will get. Zirkzee has played just 90 minutes over five appearances this season and has been an unused substitute in all the other games.",
      "However, an injury for Sesko could provide him with the opportunity to get those minutes he craves. Last season, Zirkzee showed he was capable of leading the line for United on his day.",
      "He showed great mental strength to overcome a rocky introduction to the United fans and become a forward who fans were happy to see picked ahead of Rasmus Hojlund. The arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo have scuppered him but those two have both looked better in the No.10 position.",
      "Zirkzee will feel he has a shot at cementing his place in the squad in Sesko's absence. It all depends if Amorim is willing to trust him or not.",
      "Before the match against Spurs, Amorim was clear on his thoughts on giving United's academy stars a chance. \"We have that record, we are not going to break that record and Jack [Fletcher] is ready to help us,\" the Portuguese head coach told TNT Sport when asked about the midfielder's inclusion.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo out with a knock, United could have ended an 88-year record of always including at least one academy graduate in their matchday squad. That did not happen on Saturday but could Amorim take this a step further?",
      "Chido Obi was called upon last season amidst United's poor striker form. The teenager has been given the chance to play with the academy this campaign which is of course the preferred option at 17.",
      "But, if the desire to play Zirkzee is not there and the strikerless system is not working, Obi could be the man to benefit from an opportunity. Whether he is chosen from the start or not seems unlikely though.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer live blog on Monday, November 10.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side head into the November international break unbeaten in five games after Matthijs de Ligt's late equaliser against Tottenham. Benjamin Sesko also picked up an injury in that 2-2 draw.",
      "Though there is plenty of football to play before January, transfers have become a dominant topic at Old Trafford. Loan star Marcus Rashford enjoyed another great night for Barcelona with the stance on his future becoming clearer.",
      "Elsewhere, former player James Garner has been in the headlines with a transfer truth on those links emerging. Adam Wharton has also indirectly responded to United transfer rumours with the Crystal Palace star one of three midfielders of interest to United, alongside Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson.",
      "With all of that being said, follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko will not report for international duty after picking up a knee injury.",
      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Sesko will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week, but sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Manchester United had the opportunity to climb to fourth by winning against Tottenham last weekend, but they head into the internationals sitting in seventh position with 18 points. Ruben Amorim was named the Premier League's manager of the month for October.",
      "Three wins on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton were tenure-defining, but United have shipped more goals than Amorim would like, which meant November started with two draws. The quirk is that Amorim has the most strength in depth in the defensive department, but it's currently the area that is letting the team down.",
      "The Reds must tighten up when football resumes after the break.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Sesko is reportedly expected to withdraw from international duty due to fears over an injury he picked up against Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Fellow Slovenia striker Andraz Sporar reportedly admitted: \"We will have to do without him.\"",
      "Asked for an update, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"Because it's the knee, we never know. I'm concerned with the injury because it's in the knee.",
      "\"We need Ben to be a better team. We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben.\"",
      "Man United are expected to issue an update on the striker's injury this week.",
      "Zirkzee has been urged to leave Man Unitedby fellow Dutchman Ruud Gullit.",
      "\"Everybody that leaves Man United ends up playing well,\" Gullit told Video Gamer. \"The problem there maybe is actually United. I should advise Zirkzee to go somewhere else and play more. Go back to Italy if you can on loan or whatever.",
      "\"Just play football. He's a good player. But at the moment, it's difficult at Man United. They found a little form in the past couple of weeks and I hope for Man United that they continue that. Because a good Man United is good for the Premier League as well.\"",
      "The former Bologna star has been linked with a return to the Italian top-flight.",
      "With Manchester United in search of a new midfielder, Wolves' Joao Gomes has emerged as an option.",
      "The Brazil international was superb last season but has thus far failed to reach the same standards with former head coach Vitor Pereira strangely opting to drop both him and Andre.",
      "Links to Gomes have arrived in recent days and with Wolves appearing destined for the drop, it seems unlikely he will stay which presents United with an opportunity they could look to even take advantage of in January.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to be drawn into questions surrounding the form of Benjamin Sesko following the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.",
      "The striker was introduced around the hour-mark, but failed to make an impact and ultimately left the pitch with an injury. The extent of that is current unclear but it does not look good.",
      "With that being said, MEN Sport has taken a look three options that replace the forward.",
      "Click here to read more",
      "Manchester United have been predicted to qualify for Europe through their Premier League finish, according to OPTA analytics.",
      "Unbeaten in five league games, Ruben Amorim looks to have turned a corner after a challenging first 12 months in the job.",
      "Despite that, United's expected final position has been revealed as seventh with a total of 56 points - only marginally ahead of Bournemouth. They are also three and four points behind Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "Following Benjamin Sesko's knee injury, questions started to emerge over Rasmus Hojlund and whether or not he could be recalled from a loan spell at Napoli.",
      "However, under the terms of his switch, United do not have the option to bring him back with the £38million buy-option clause the only term inserted into his move.",
      "The Denmark international made a great start to his Napoli career but he has now gone four games without a goal and Antonio Conte's side have struggled to find the back of the net as such.",
      "Goalless draws against Como and Eintracht Frankfurt came before Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Bologna with Hojlund playing the full 90 minutes. He was unsurprisingly booked after committing five fouls and losing 13 duels.",
      "Benjamin Sesko picked up a knee injury during Manchester United's draw with Tottenham and several updates have emerged since then.",
      "The first of those came from Ruben Amorim as he admitted the striker had a \"problem\". An update from Slovenia ahead of their international fixtures then arrived with it stated he underwent an initial examination on his knee on Sunday.",
      "Concerns over the severity of his problem are relatively high with that heightened by a video of him departing the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium courtesy of Joao Castelo-Branco on X.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt feels Manchester United suffered from low energy levels in the second half against Tottenham.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring in the 32nd minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, carefully placing a header into the left corner following an intelligent cross from Amad.",
      "Tottenham started the second half well and forced Senne Lammens into action. The Belgian international made two important saves and United appeared to have weathered the storm, but Spurs continued to push and found an equaliser through Mathys Tel with just six minutes remaining.",
      "Richarlison scored during added time to make it 2-1 and thought he had won the game for Tottenham, but De Ligt scored in the dying seconds to rescue a point for United in London.",
      "The Dutchman spoke to MUTV after the final whistle and explained what went wrong.",
      "De Ligt said: \"I think it's a little bit of mixed feelings. I think mixed because I'm quite happy we scored to make it 2-2 in the last minute, but also a little disappointed because I felt we could have won this game.",
      "\"Also, the way they scored two goals... Quite lucky, basically with two deflections, which is always a shame, but in the end 2-2 is always better than losing, so I'm happy with that.\"",
      "De Ligt was asked about showing spirit, and said: \"We did, especially in the first half, we showed that. We were really compact, aggressive and made it difficult for them.",
      "\"And then in the second half, it felt like we were lacking a little bit of energy. That's something we have to look at because in the Premier League, you get punished for that.",
      "\"But we still kept it 0-0, and the last 15 minutes it felt like we were really tired and they kept on coming and coming. At some point, you know if they keep coming into the box, then it will be dangerous. That happened, but fair play to the team for coming back and drawing 2-2.",
      "\"I'm happy to contribute to the team [with the goal] and happy that we at least got a draw today.\"",
      "De Ligt was not included in the leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but Ruben Amorim said he leads by example when he spoke during his post-match press conference.",
      "Amorim said of the decision: \"We choose. Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play, then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other. I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",
      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",

      "Time is a luxury rarely afforded to Premier League players, particularly those at top clubs who have signed in mega-money deals. Sign for the Premier League champions for a British record transfer fee and you can expect the heat to be on you immediately.",
      "Arne Slot asked again last week for Alexander Isak to be given more time after a stuttering start to his Anfield career. The Swedish striker has just one goal in eight games since his blockbuster summer switch, an early-season return that has of course been impacted by injury issues.",
      "Nevertheless, one goal against lower league opposition - his sole striker coming against Southampton in the Carabao Cup - in more than 400 minutes of football is not good enough from the most expensive player in top flight history.",
      "No transfer will ever be devoid of risk, but steps can be taken to reduce the risk attached to new signings.",
      "Manchester United looked to take said steps in the summer, with two of their marquee signings drafted in from fellow Premier League clubs.",
      "Amorim referenced the benefit of buying players who had already adapted to life in England and the Premier League earlier this year, saying of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha: “It’s important to sign players as soon as possible. They’ve proved already in the Premier League. Matheus can play in different positions so you can change the starting XI.",
      "“They are really humble, that is really important. They had other options, they read what people say about our club but they chose to be here and this is a key point for me.\"",
      "Summer signing Senne Lammens has made an immediate impact since his debut against Sunderland, though there's a strong case to be made that the excitement around the young Belgian owes as much to the disastrous displays of those who came before him as much has his own solid showings. But Mbeumo and Cunha have undoubtedly been the stand-out stars of United's summer recruitment.",
      "Much has been made of the Premier League experience they brought with them to Old Trafford, and it has certainly helped them settle. But the performances of Isak at Liverpool prove that moving from one Premier League side to another does not guarantee success.",
      "With the pressure ramped up and the scrutiny intensified following a move to one of the biggest clubs in the league, plenty of players understandably wilt.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have done the exact opposite. And that deserves to be recognised.",

      "So often a last-minute equaliser feels like a winner, but not on this occasion. United should have seen out the game against a side that looked bereft of confidence.",
      "Instead, the pressure was allowed to build and Spurs made them pay. There was good fortune involved in Mathys Tel's goal but Richarlison's header was a bitter pill to swallow.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's equaliser was rightfully celebrated, and perhaps last season it may not have come. But the Dutchman's admission after the game is something which Ruben Amorim cannot choose to ignore.",
      "\"We were really compact, aggressive and made it difficult for them [in the first half],\" De Ligt told MUTV. \"And then in the second half, it felt like we were lacking a little bit of energy.",

      "Speaking after the game, Patrick Dorgu agreed with De Ligt's assessment.",
      "This season United are, of course, not in Europe and they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle, so they should be fitter and fresher than ever. Yet still the team are struggling to see out games. That will be of huge concern to Amorim.",
      "Perhaps a little bit of fatigue has started to creep in due to the success Amorim has enjoyed with a more settled side in recent matches.",
      "The constant chopping and changing last season was a result of underwhelming performances and the new manager not knowing what his best team was. While it was largely condemned as a sign of how bad United were, it also had the benefit of allowing the squad to be used more evenly across the course of the campaign.",
      "In Amorim's first 12 games across all competitions for United, he started 23 different players. This season's opening 12 have seen just 21 different starters.",
      "However, it must be taken into account that United made wholesale changes against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, which skews the figures slightly. In recent weeks, Amorim has kept the bulk of outfield players the same at the start of each match.",
      "De Ligt, Senne Lammens, Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are all guaranteed starters when fit and that is ultimately the core of the squad. While it is good to have that solid core, Amorim must know that rotation is the key to ensure that strength does not become a weakness.",
      "United's players are playing fewer games but the same faces are being picked for consistency. This is where the lack of squad depth becomes an issue.",
      "Amorim will have seen that United often become weaker this season when changes are made. At the beginning of the campaign, he spoke about being happy to work with a smaller squad due to the lack of European football but those words may be coming back to haunt him.",
      "After the international break, Amorim needs to heed the warning from De Ligt. If he doesn't, it will start costing United more points.",

      "Manchester United youngster James Overy could represent Australia at the World Cup next summer.",
      "Overy has participated in several first-team training sessions at Carrington. Last week, he was rewarded with a first call-up to Australia's senior national team for the November international break.",
      "The youngster celebrated his 18th birthday last weekend, but he is considered a high-potential talent and United beat other Premier League clubs to his signature in the summer of 2024.",
      "Shortly after signing for United, Overy picked up an injury and spent eight months on the sidelines, but he returned to action in February and has continued to progress this season.",
      "Although Overy has only made a handful of appearances for United's Under-21s, Australia's manager Tony Popovic believes the youngster has a chance of making the Socceroos’ World Cup squad next year.",
      "Popovic discussed Overy at a press conference and said: “If they’re in the squad now they’re a chance for the World Cup.",
      "“Yes, there are some players that obviously can be more long-term prospects, can be prospects for after the World Cup, maybe the Asian Cup, certainly the next cycle.",
      "\"But it doesn’t rule them out of this World Cup coming up. And James is one of those. I watched him at the Under-20 World Cup. [Assistant coach] Paul Okon is very well aware of all the young players, having worked closely with those age groups, with the national team.",
      "\"So I knew what he could do. Watching him closely in Chile, I was impressed. In particular, coming in, playing the second match, and starting on the left – the youngest player there, starting at left-back.",
      "“He showed a lot of composure, a lot of maturity for his age and then he went to the right in the third game. And then we started really monitoring him. We have good contacts at Man United so we know what he’s doing at training. We know how much he trains, how much he trains with the first team.",
      "\"He’s getting games at the Under 18s, the U21s. And I just thought he’s worth having a look at. And let’s see, I’m very open-minded with what that looks like for the immediate future and obviously long-term.”",
      "Overy, who is eligible to play for Australia, Scotland and England, departed Australian side Perth Glory in the summer of 2023, and his family relocated to Devon before he moved to Manchester.",
      "The right-back was subject to Premier League interest since catching the eye playing for Perth Glory's senior side in a pre-season friendly against West Ham when he was aged just 15.",

      "On the luxurious walk down to the mixed zone at the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the assembled Manchester United and Tottenham media cohorts tried to make sense of the final ten minutes of the game.",
      "United looked to be cruising to victory having rode the initial storm chucked at them by Spurs at the start of the second half. If you had told Patrick Dorgu and his teammates that they would go away with just one point - they would have been disappointed.",
      "As it was, United came out thankful that it was not a defeat. Mathys Tel's deflected strike and Richarlison's flicked header seemed to have sealed the victory for Spurs and ended United's unbeaten run.",
      "However, an exceptionally late Matthijs de Ligt header secured a point and kept United unbeaten since their loss to Brentford. As we waited in hope that we would hear from the United camp, two Tottenham workers headed into the United side of the tunnel with handfuls of champagne flutes.",
      "\"Obviously it was good to come back and show team spirit but we are disappointed in not winning the game.\" For United it was a case of deja vu.",
      "At Nottingham Forest a week prior, United went into the break with a one-goal advantage, squandered it and then rescued it late on. Against Spurs, the result was further in the extremes but the pattern was all too familiar.",
      "In his post-match comments to TNT Sport, De Ligt admitted that United were tired in the second half and this was a sentiment Dorgu could agree with. \"Yeah, I think it was a tough game for everyone,\" he explained.",
      "\"Obviously they play very direct so it was hard for the defenders to always track runs. It was a competitive game.\"",
      "Having earned another point, United now head into the latest international break in better spirits than they were just a month ago. While the Sunderland victory was welcomed, it was hard to tell if that was the exception to the rule or not.",
      "In the end, it was the start of a good run which continues into November. Reflecting on the mood in the camp going into that break, Dorgu was keen to stress that spirits remain high for United and their players.",
      "\"We are unbeaten in five games so we are still feeling good,\" Dorgu concluded. \"We are not losing games so, now, we need to just keep bouncing back and get the next one after the internationals.\"",
      "If United are to thoroughly turn the corner, their next game is one that they need to be winning. Everton have won just once on their travels this season and sit comfortably in mid-table.",
      "The Toffees await Dorgu and Co. on Monday, November 24.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is out-performing Manchester United's Mason Mount this season following the Argentinian international's departure to Chelsea.",
      "Garnacho joined Chelsea in August for £40m following his fallout with Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final. The 21-year-old felt he deserved more minutes in the game, and after venting his frustrations publicly, Amorim hit back by saying: \"You better hope you have a good agent this summer.\"",
      "It was an ugly exit for the winger who had been at the club since he joined the academy in 2020. Now a Chelsea player, Garnacho is beginning to find his feet after a slow start in west London.",
      "A player who made the reverse move, from Chelsea to United, is Mount. The Englishman, who was signed under Erik ten Hag for £60m, hasn't hit the form at Old Trafford that he once portrayed with Chelsea.",
      "Admittedly, Mount has been unlucky with injuries. Five separate injuries have seen the 26-year-old miss just over 50 games for United, but when he has featured this season, he has managed just one goal and one assist in nine appearances.",
      "Garnacho on the other hand has picked up two goals and two assists in his 10 matches for Chelsea. Both assists came in Chelsea's 3-0 win over Wolves on Saturday.",
      "United have an unfortunate recent history of selling players, only for those players to then go and excel at different clubs. One of the most prominent examples is Scott McTominay.",
      "Since joining Napoli for £25m last season, the Scotland international has become one of the Italian club's top players. He was named the Serie A MVP for the 2024/25 season and finished 18th in the 2025 Ballon d'Or rankings after helping Napoli to win their fourth Italian league title.",
      "Garnacho's story at Chelsea isn't yet one of McTominay's stature. However, what it could become is a brutal reality check for Amorim and how valuable he sees Mount within the squad.",
      "United's No.7 has shown tactical versatility under Amorim. He has sometimes featured as a left-sided number 10, left-winger, and even as a false nine.",
      "The ability to move positions with little negative effect is something the United manager values highly due to his unique formations. At the end of 2024, Amorim publicly stated his admiration for Mount when he said: \"I have to tell you I love that kid.",
      "\"The first thing is he is working really hard. And then you have to understand the human also. You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me...\"",
      "Mount is still young and has plenty of time to recover any lost form this season. His contract with United expires in 2028, and with Amorim already displaying his fondness for the midfielder, the 26-year-old looks set for more opportunites. But Amorim will undoubtedly want to see some improvement soon.",

      "Manchester United's October resurgence owed a lot to the improved performances of some of their star men.",
      "Casemiro has been highly impressive in central midfield. He improved in the Europa League last season but few would have thought he would be the first choice this season when everyone was fit.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was one of the few consistent performers before the unbeaten run. However, he reached another level again in October and was deservedly named the Premier League's Player of the Month.",
      "His good form was in part due to his flourishing partnership with Amad. Since his loan spell at Sunderland, the Ivorian has been a favourite among the fanbase.",
      "Erik ten Hag's sacking in October 2024 was arguably the best thing that could have happened to the winger. From being overlooked for large spells by the Dutchman, Amad has gone on to become one of United's most important players.",
      "The summer arrivals of Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha meant it soon became clear Amad would be used predominantly in the right wing-back role - despite being named as one of the two No.10s against Tottenham on Saturday - having switched between right wing-back and No.10 following Amorim's arrival.",
      "Some worried whether Amad would be able to play the role as a natural attacking player and if a new signing would need to be made. While the 23-year-old has had his struggles defensively in the wide role, on the whole he has been excellent.",
      "He has admitted that he is still working on the defensive side of his game but offensively Amad is a huge threat and his combination with Mbeumo has added a new dimension to United's play.",
      "But trouble is on the horizon. Both Mbeumo and Amad will soon depart for AFCON. Mbeumo has been brilliant this season but Mason Mount has shown glimpses of promise to be able to step into his role.",
      "Meanwhile, it's difficult to see who the replacement for Amad will be. United have options in that position but neither Diogo Dalot nor Noussair Mazraoui are capable of providing the attacking threat that Amad offers.",
      "In just over a month, the forgotten concerns about who can play in the right wing-back position will come to the fore once more.",
      "While it is only temporary, it will be a healthy reminder to Amorim that United need a back-up attacking right wing-back for Amad.",

He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",

      "Manchester United's director of women's football Matt Johnson has insisted that Wednesday night will be the club's opportunity to \"write their future\" when they host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.",
      "The clash will be the first time United's women's team have featured at Old Trafford in the Champions League. This season is also the first time they have made it to the group/league phase of the elite European competition.",
      "However, the scale of the tournament is not daunting the Reds. So far, they have won their opening two matches in the Champions League and if they beat PSG United will be well on their way to progressing to the knockout stages.",
      "Johnson spoke at Carrington this week and was eager not to underestimate the scale of next week's fixture. \"It is an opportunity to write the future in terms of it not just being the men who have played in the Champions League on those special nights at Old Trafford, the women’s team have done that as well,\" he explained.",
      "\"That sets a precedent and once you break a barrier, that opens it up to go further and forwards so for me, it is a really good statement for the women’s game, a really good statement for Manchester United that we can run these special nights for the team.\"",
      "Johnson is adamant that there is no rush to make these nights more regular in the WSL and Champions League. \"It is about growing the women’s game in a sustainable manner and doing things cleverly,\" he added.",
      "\"What we want to do first of all is to make sure that we are creating a really good experience and having crowds full is better than having a few in a massive stadium. The first real target is, if we think we can get more than the 12,000 that we have at Leigh Sports Village, then we will take it to Old Trafford.",
      "\"So the Manchester derby is always at Old Trafford because we know, as we have proven, that we can get 30-40,000 there so we will take it there. For us, it is about growing the game in a sustainable way where we are starting to get 10-12,000 in every week at Leigh because then it becomes a case that now we can grow the game and take it to Old Trafford.\"",
      "Testing themselves against a team like PSG is a good marker to see where this United team is among Europe's elite. However, win, lose or draw, Johnson is keen to see the club stick to their plan.",
      "\"The club has got a very public goal out there. We want to win the WSL by 2028,\" he said.",
      "\"For us, the aim is can we get closer to that each year? For us, it is pretty clear, when you are at Manchester United - and this is what the players embrace - we want to win trophies.",
      "\"That is the No.1 goal. Therefore, to do that, our aim is to go deep in all the competitions that we compete in. Then, once you go deep, then it is on the night the performances that count.",
      "\"In the Champions League, the short-term goal was to qualify for the first time in the club’s history, which we did and that is not an easy process - going to Stockholm and playing two games in four days. Then we had the double leg against Brann.",
      "\"So we have done the first part and the next is to qualify for the next stage, either automatically or through the play-offs, that has to be the ambition and from the start that we have had, that is where we have got to get to.\"",
      "\"It is one of the biggest [occasions for the club],\" Johnson concluded when asked about the PSG clash. \"It is the first Champions League game at Old Trafford - that will be history and will be in the club’s history forever so that makes it massive.",
      "\"The fact that we have had a good start and managing to get three wins out of a league system with only six games would give us a strong route to at least the play-offs. So for the size of it, the opponents that we are playing who are very good with a lot of French internationals as well, I think it will be definitely up there as one of the biggest nights for Manchester United women’s football.\"",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "But there is an underlying evaluation which weighs heavily in favour of Arsenal over Liverpool when looking at their results this season against the corresponding fixtures from last season.",

      "The 5-1 thrashing of Manchester City in February, downgraded to a 1-1 draw in September, applies a lot of gloss to the comparative goals column of 2024/25. But perhaps the biggest indication that Arsenal have evolved is that the two wins which propelled them to the top of the table heading into the October international break came in fixtures they lost last campaign: Newcastle (a) and West Ham (h). Then they won at Craven Cottage for the first time in well over two years, and beat Crystal Palace at home having drawn to them in April.",

      "Ally McCoist and former Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster have picked out lots of positives after the Red Devils held Tottenham to a 2-2 draw on Saturday.",
      "Spurs thought they had won the game when Richarlison put Thomas Frank’s side ahead in second half injury time after Bryan Mbeumo and Mathys Tel had scored earlier in the match.",
      "But Matthijs de Ligt popped up in the sixth minute of injury time to salvage a point from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and keep Man Utd on a run of five Premier League matches unbeaten.",
      "Many onlookers were underwhelmed by the performance of both teams but McCoist and Foster can see the positives in recent weeks.",
      "McCoist thinks Man Utd are now “harder to play against”, “better in forward areas” and more resilient, while he picked out Amad Diallo and Patrick Dorgu for their good displays against Tottenham.",
      "Speaking to host Jeff Stelling on talkSPORT, McCoist said: “I also think Jeff, in times gone by they wouldn’t have got the point. I think there’s more about them, it’s evident. There’s far more about them. Miles away from the finished article it has to be said. But they look slightly harder to play against, and they certainly look, I think, better in forward areas.",
      "READ: Man Utd could revert to type as two summer signings justify Ruben Amorim’s new transfer priority",
      "“Some good performances. I thought Dorgu played well. I thought Amad played really, really well. We’ve mentioned Cunha and Mbeumo before. Those two in particular, at this early stage, I think two terrific new signings can handle it, not even handle it, look as though they’re thriving in that kind of situation.",
      "“So I think at this early stage, there’s must be heaps of positives from Manchester United, but still a lot of work to do. But I take your point. They’re disappointed at getting the point, but I think maybe, you know, certainly last season, I don’t think they’re getting the point.”",
      "When asked if he sensed a changing attitude at Man Utd, former goalkeeper Ben Foster added: “Yeah, I think Ally’s probably just said everything that needed to be said right there. I only watched the game on the TV, but they look okay.",
      "“They look like they’re playing with a lot more confidence and have done for most of this season. But I just think when you sort of contrast it to the quality of Man City, for example, last night, I think it’s very evident there’s still quite a way to go.”",
      "McCoist added: “I think that’s in a nutshell, mate, I really do. I think there’s definitely been improvements. I think the positivity around Manchester United is understandable. And so there should be the small steps, but in terms of the large steps needed to get to the likes of the level of Manchester City, which we saw yesterday, they are still a good bit away.",
      "“But I still think Amorim speaks really well better, don’t you think? And I think I actually think it was a good piece of ownership coming out and effectively backing him for a couple of years so that everybody knows [he’s going to be there a while]. And just as importantly, never mind the fans knowing, I think the players knowing that he’s going to be there for a while is something as well.”",
      "Foster continued: “I think people just tend to forget that the Premier League is actually really hard. To be honest, the general quality of the Premier League is really, really hard and to put a string of games together [is difficult].",
      "“We’re saying it all over the Premier League, but a string of games together where you’re winning consistently is really, really hard to do. So sometimes you just have to make sure you don’t lose. And I think for Manchester United, they would have lost that game earlier in the season, they would have lost that game.",
      "“They wouldn’t have had it about them to go and really search for that equaliser. I think it’s the mentality shift, the mentality change in the players. They’re all starting to buy into it now, from what the manager is saying. He’s been saying it for the best part of the year, in fairness to him – but I think it’s finally seeping into the players, and you can see when players play with that belief, and that positivity and the confidence, that you get better results for it as well.”",
      "Five pundits give their predictions as Liverpool face Man Utd on Sunday looking to an end a run of three straight defeats in all competitions.",
      "Ally McCoist and Rio Ferdinand thinks Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be given “more time” at Old Trafford amid sack rumours.",
      "Rangers legend Ally McCoist has changed his Premier League title prediction after backing Liverpool before the season kicked off.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",
      "Premier League legend David Beckham has tipped Newcastle to “surprise” people in this season’s Champions League, while Ben Foster believes Nick Woltemade is “made for” the Magpies.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. Though against Manchester United, you might wonder if he could have done more to keep out the two headers that beat him.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford and Brighton, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. A slight fall here after conceding two to Arsenal. Leandro Trossard’s rocket was unstoppable, but Roefs never quite got himself in the right shape to deal better with Bukayo Saka’s leveller. He retains the highest saves percentage in the league, though.",
      "",
      "Lammens continues to dazzle United fans with simple competency. The Belgian made a couple of fine saves at Spurs and could do little to stop either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "A first clean sheet in seven sees Pickford climb here. The England keeper just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "Still only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope whose England recall has been scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "One of the biggest climbers in recent weeks. Conceded six over trips to Brighton and Forest but the combined PSxG was 7.9.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric during his last Prem appearance at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. No biggie for Dan Ballard’s opener, but the Black Cats’ late leveller would have been prevented had Raya not rushed from his goal.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Prior to a comparatively comfortable outing against Leeds, last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",
      "",
      "The Bournemouth keeper is a big faller after conceding four at Villa from a PSxG of 2.3. Perhaps to be expected that after selling most of their defence, the Cherries have allowed more shots on their goal than all but Burnley and Forest.",
      "",

      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "Back in the West Ham side after Hermansen’s ropey start to his Hammers career, Areola has done little to suggest he should stay there. Dropped another bollock against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",

They’ve spoken already to his representative several times about this intention they have to give him a new contract. At the same time, let’s see what’s going to happen there, because the boy has been super professional already last summer, when he already had some kind of opportunity if he wanted to go.",

So Palace are super happy with Adam, and Adam is quite happy with Palace. He understands that he’s probably at the best club to develop in this moment for him.",

So at the moment, there is this intention from Palace to give him a new contract, but we are not yet at the stage where we say, okay, it’s guaranteed, because it’s still early stages of the conversation.”",

      "Romano told GiveMeSport: “Conor Gallagher could be an opportunity, but Atletico Madrid didn’t want to let him go in August. So let’s see what happens in the January window.",
      "“Angelo Stiller is also a player they appreciate from Stuttgart, but I don’t see a German club selling one of the stars in the January window at all. So January is not going to be easy.",
      "“It’s going to be about opportunities in the summer, which could be different. And for sure, Manchester United in 2026 will add again, at least one midfielder.”",

      "On Guerra, the report adds ‘Although he was under contract until 2029 with a €100 million release clause, the club knows they could let him go for between €20 and €25 million. This reduction reflects the fact that the player is no longer performing at the required level, and the time seems right to sell.’",
      "Describing interest from Man Utd, Fichajes continues: ‘On the other hand, Manchester United have also shown interest in Javi Guerra, who fits into their future plans. In England, they see him as a versatile midfielder with good physique and stamina, who could adapt to the Red Devils’ system. The English club believe they can acquire him for a reduced fee compared to what Valencia asked for a year ago, precisely because of the player’s current situation.’",

      "Ruben Amorim ‘wants another attacker in January’ and it’s easy to see why, as Manchester United are already over-reliant on two summer signings…",
      "It was unusual to watch from a distance as Man Utd were actually competent in this summer’s transfer window, as Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recruitment team oversaw their positive overhaul.",
      "Their measured approach ensured the Red Devils bided their time to land most of their top summer targets, with this much-needed model shift ensuring that they were not plagued by poor recruitment as they had in virtually every window since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.",
      "Understandably, Amorim‘s side placed most of their focus on signing upgrades in attacking positions after they were toothless in forward areas in 2024/25.",
      "Around £200m was invested to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko before they landed Senne Lammens in the final days of the window to replace former No.1 goalkeeper Andre Onana.",
      "READ: Amorim blushes spared by De Ligt as Frank outclasses Man Utd boss from the touchline",
      "It is also worth noting that the Premier League giants were equally astute with offloading players, with Tyrell Malacia the only member of their so-called ‘bomb squad’ not to be sent elsewhere in the summer on permanent or loan-to-buy deals.",
      "These factors have contributed to Man Utd’s improvement under Amorim, as there have been clear signs of progression; their ongoing five-game run in the Premier League has seen them shoot up the table.",
      "So, United are on track, but there is still a lot of work to be done if they are to return to challenging for the Premier League and/or Champions League under this current regime.",
      "Lammens is a clear improvement on Onana but cannot be deemed the next Peter Schmeichel yet, while Sesko possesses the natural qualities to come good once he’s up to speed with Premier League life.",
      "They and most other Man Utd players have been massively overshadowed by Mbeumo and Cunha, though.",
      "Man Utd’s lack of a suitable No.10 for Amorim’s formation was a key factor behind their attacking woes last season, with this issue eased by the arrivals of Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The two forwards have immediately hit the ground running at Man Utd, having arrived with Premier League experience and the character to relish rather than flounder under the spotlight at Old Trafford.",
      "Mbeumo, who deserved his October Player of the Month award, grabbed his sixth Premier League goal involvement for Man Utd against Spurs. Cunha, meanwhile, has been less prolific but has been equally important with his chance creation and work rate.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo’s performances have reached such a level that they are already among a handful of Man Utd’s most indispensable assets, as their attitude, intensity and decision-making have exposed Joshua Zirkzee, Mason Mount and last season’s options, who are levels below their two standouts.",
      "It is brilliant for Man Utd that Cunha and Mbeumo have made such an impact, but United’s overreliance on these two players poses a serious problem for Amorim in the coming/weeks.",
      "United will be without Mbeumo and Amad Diallo for most of December due to the African Cup of Nations, while there is also the looming threat of another injury to Cunha.",
      "Without one or two of these players, there would be a severe drop-off in the quality and efficiency of Man Utd’s attack, with Cunha and Mbeumo justifying Amorim’s reported new demand for ‘another attacker’ to be signed in January.",
      "It has also been widely reported that the Red Devils are aware that they need a new No.6, though Casemiro’s recent resurgence has made signing Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton less of a necessity for January.",
      "Instead, ‘another attacker’ is their actual priority for the January window as Man Utd face reverting to their 2024/25 toothlessness once they are without Mbeumo and/or Cunha for an extended period, as they do not currently have the necessary depth to ward off a sudden decline.",
      "Daniel Farke is the clear frontrunner, but Eddie Howe is now second favourite in the Sack Race after another Newcastle defeat and Arne Slot is far from safe.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim reportedly wants a new attacker in the January transfer window amid Benjamin Sesko’s underwhelming performances.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will be a significant miss when he heads to AFCON with Cameroon, but Owen Hargreaves reckons Manchester United are “good enough” to cope.",
      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Man Utd therefore deserved to win.",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United."

      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been two wins from two since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously third in the league.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 11th in the table after 11 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",
      "",
      "Four points from two games against Manchester United and Leeds has given Forest the lift they badly needed and leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Back-to-back wins over Newcastle and Burnley mean it’s a comfier interlull than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable and leaves Liverpool languishing in eighth.",
      "",
      "We still think they’d regret it if they pull the trigger, but it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "Hitting the November international break outside the bottom three does feel like it counts as mission thus far accomplished, but defeat in a six-pointer at West Ham has removed all wriggle room.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and what is now officially an iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. League position can mislead given the congestion behind Arsenal and a bloated mid-table, but Newcastle are now closer to the bottom three than they are to 13th-placed Everton, and whatever the mitigation that just won’t do.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest. It’s deep trouble now.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘wants another attacker in January’ and it’s easy to see why, as Manchester United are already overly reliant on two summer signings…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim reportedly wants a new attacker in the January transfer window amid Benjamin Sesko’s underwhelming performances.",
      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Man Utd therefore deserved to win.",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants to retain the services of a key Man Utd pair he’s ‘really happy’ with beyond the end of the season."

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost five in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an eight-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "Liverpool now also trail in forlornly behind Manchester City, Chelsea, Sunderland Tottenham, Aston Villa and – most humiliating of all – Manchester United.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in one Liverpool are struggling in.",
      "No club has been picked for more Premier League TV games than Manchester United, with a surprise team alongside them and ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Manuel Ugarte have become significant problems for Manchester United and Liverpool. But Tomas Soucek and Brian Brobbey are flying.",
      "Nottingham Forest spent big in the summer to improve their squad but neither Nuno Espirito Santo nor Ange Postecoglou could make sense of it. Enter Dyche.",
      "Liverpool are bad enough and the timing international-break enough for us to pretend Arne Slot might be about to get sacked and, thus, replaced.",
      "Pep Guardiola has two unlikely solutions to his Manchester City full-back problem; they are almost perfect with Matheus Nunes and Nico O’Reilly in tandem."

      "Manchester United fans are losing patience with £51million midfielder Manuel Ugarte, while Casemiro’s stock continues to rise.",
      "Ugarte came off the bench in United’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham on Saturday afternoon with his side 1-0 up.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side equalised 12 minutes after the Uruguayan’s introduction, and seven minutes later, the Red Devils were 2-1 down.",
      "United did salvage a draw in the 96th minute thanks to Matthijs de Ligt, but it was another poor performance from Ugarte, who was beaten too easily by Wilson Odobert for Spurs’ equaliser and played Richarlison onside for his 91st-minute header.",
      "There’s no doubt that Casemiro is a vastly superior option to Ugarte in Ruben Amorim’s midfield, with a defensive-minded midfielder needed for the role next to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "But as Ugarte is earning £120,000 a week, cost the club £51m from Paris Saint-Germain, and Amorim is obsessed with making substitutions – whether necessary or not – he will continue to come off the bench.",
      "At this point, his involvement is hurting Manchester United, not helping them.",
      "Ugarte is meant to bring solidity to the middle of the park and help see out games. Instead, he’s literally doing the opposite, acting more like a super sub for the opposition than the Red Devils.",
      "Odobert glided past him as if he wasn’t there for Spurs’ equaliser, and Ugarte stepping up for Richarlison’s go-ahead goal was incredibly lazy, showing a lack of concentration and awareness.",
      "Don’t just take our word for it; the proof is in the pudding.",
      "In the Premier League, Manchester United haven’t won during Ugarte’s time on the pitch, and their +/- goals is -6, with a +/- points per 90 minutes of 1.89.",
      "Furthermore, United have conceded nine goals in only 285 minutes with Ugarte on the pitch, while Casemiro has been on for only five of the 18 goals conceded in 543 minutes this season.",
      "In terms of goals scored, United have netted 12 with Casemiro on the pitch and only three with Ugarte.",
      "Looking at specific examples:",
      "We haven’t even mentioned that Ugarte started in the Carabao Cup at Grimsby Town and was hooked at half-time with Amorim’s men 2-0 down.",
      "Casemiro’s game by numbers vs. Spurs:",
      "100% long pass accuracy\n100% cross accuracy\n83% pass accuracy\n56% ground duels won\n44 touches\n5 passes into the final third\n5 ball recoveries\n4 tackles\n4 clearances",
      "Having a brilliant season. 👏 pic.twitter.com/TjWuEIGqsl",
      "— Statman Dave (@StatmanDave) November 8, 2025",
      "There’s still time for Ugarte to come good. After all, Casemiro was world class, then abysmal, and is now one of United’s most important players – definitely Amorim’s biggest success story in the squad.",
      "Ugarte is more of a hindrance than a help defensively, and is obviously limited going forward, so it’s surely time for Amorim to properly trial a partnership of Kobbie Mainoo and Fernandes if he doesn’t want to keep Casemiro on for the full 90 minutes.",
      "Substituting Casemiro off seems to be a habit for Amorim. Unnecessary substitutions are becoming one of his strongest ‘attributes’.",
      "The Portuguese manager constantly changes his centre-backs mid-game, bringing off Harry Maguire against Spurs, for example, despite him playing well.",
      "According to reports, two ‘struggling’ Manchester United stars face being offloaded next year, while the Red Devils could seal a bargain transfer.",
      "Man Utd face ‘decision time’ on the futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Harry Maguire, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "One of Erik ten Hag’s signings at Man Utd has been labelled a “wet blanket” by Craig Burley, who would put them “in with the kids”.",
      "Manchester United didn’t buy a midfielder because they felt they have ‘strong and versatile’ options. Ruben Amorim needs Manuel Ugarte to shape up sharpish as one of them…"

      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Manchester United therefore deserved to win.",
      "There was a predictable spattering of boos at half-time from the Tottenham fans, who had watched another insipid attacking performance from their team on a home patch which has reaped the scant reward of 13 points from their previous 19 Premier League games.",
      "While Joao Palhinha and Pape Matar Sarr offered the very same inability to progress the ball from the base of midfield, Xavi Simons was frequently spotted looking up and seeing no-one to either bounce the ball off or find running in behind thanks to the almost comically inert and toothless trio of Brennan Johnson, Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani playing ahead of him.",
      "The surprise in Spurs’ one decent chance wasn’t Richarlison entirely missing his header but Johnson creating that opportunity with a very fine cross, such was their shocking end product or even ability to get into a position where end products matter besides.",
      "Micky van de Ven produced a sublime tackle to deny Benjamin Sesko late in the game which ended up being worthy of the Man of the Match award as Ally McCoist scratched his head in search of alternatives, but the centre-back didn’t cover himself in glory in the first half.",
      "Understandably buoyed by his extraordinary solo goal against Copenhagen, he ignored the first inevitable and thoroughly enjoyable roar from the Tottenham fans when he jinked past a Manchester United forward with the ball at his feet from the back, but failed at the second time of asking, imagining the goal celebration when a full 70 yards from goal before being tackled after about ten of those yards as the ball got away from him.",
      "And while Sarr is undeniably the chief culprit when laying blame for the Manchester United opener, a less panicked centre-back would have taken a touch and cleared, while one with Van de Ven’s very particular set of skills could have dribbled his way out of trouble, with Bruno Fernandes admittedly close but also the only Manchester United player in his vicinity.",
      "There are also few more gear-grinding sights than the public dressing down of one player by another in a blatant bid to make sure everyone in the stadium knows who’s at fault. Sarr knows he’s made a mistake, the fans know he’s made a mistake. The only purpose the on-pitch scolding serves is to make Van de Ven look like a self-serving so-and-so.",
      "The quality of Spurs’ forwards was in stark contrast to Manchester United’s for the vast majority of this game. Amad Diallo’s delivery for Mbeumo was excellent, and while the Cameroon international scoring a header with his feet firmly rooted on the ground isn’t a great sign of Spurs’ defensive order, it was very well directed by a player who was a constant threat both with and without the ball.",

      "United looked to be cruising, albeit not entirely convincingly, towards a relatively comfortable victory until the managers rang the changes in the second half.",
      "The most ardent boos of the day came when Xavi Simons was taken off once again. But Frank may well be afforded more leeway with regard to his hooking in future as his replacement Mathys Tel scored the equaliser with a deflected shot past Senne Lammens after a quite brilliant first touch following a cross from fellow sub Destiny Udogie, who – like yet another sub, Wilson Odobert – did this alien thing of taking on and beating defenders before delivering the ball.",
      "Frank also deserves credit for leaving Richarlison on the pitch. Few would have complained at him not coming out for the second half, let alone still being around to expertly flick Odobert’s shot past Lammens with his head.",
      "But as much blame should be laid at Amorim’s door as praise bestowed upon Frank after the Manchester United boss contrived to put his team in a position where the towering Matthijs de Ligt header deep into stoppage time was required for them to claim a point when they looked destined for three for so long.",
      "Mason Mount’s touch and blind pass for Sesko before that Van de Ven tackle was stunning, and their introduction from the bench made a positive difference, but why oh why is Amorim obsessed with changing his centre-backs? Harry Maguire had been faultless and while Leny Yoro didn’t do anything wrong per se, it just creates a needless disruption when things are going smoothly.",
      "And frankly we can’t imagine just how entirely knackered, injured or concussed Casemiro would have to be to make it a good idea to bring him off for Manuel Ugarte. Tottenham had no joy in front of the United defence before that change was made in the 72nd minute, and Odobert was found in that space for both goals.",
      "Amorim got his starting XI right, Frank got it wrong, but the Tottenham manager outclassed his Manchester United counterpart from the touchline. They each did their level best to lose this game through their decisions, but instead head into the international break with a point that is serviceable if uninspiring, which also neatly serves as a perfect description of both of these teams right now.",

      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Tottenham’s last 19 Premier League games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium comprise three wins, four draws and 12 defeats. It’s a harrowing run which would ordinarily make firm Manchester United favourites amid their promising uptick in form.",
      "But the Red Devil somehow contriving to lose not once, not twice or even thrice to Spurs last season but four times, combined with Amorim’s side winning just once away from home this term, makes this a particularly hard game to call, with their respective impossible-to-gauge quality making it near impossible.",
      "Much of the criticism aimed at Amorim in his time at Manchester United, before the improvement of late which saw him named Manager of the Month for October, has been based around his obstinacy.",
      "It’s 3-4-3 or bust and it’s typically been the latter. He’s stubbornly refused to deviate from his formation and philosophy, and while we don’t expect that to change too much against Tottenham, it could feel a tad perverse to some that – as he admitted in a pre-match interview – he’s made changes to his team with the aim of “doing something different” on the back of three wins and a draw in his last four games.",
      "“We’ve been working on it this week,” he added, and that’s a luxury he has over Thomas Frank and most of the other managers of teams vying for places towards the top of the Premier League, with no European football this season granting him the space to make tactical tweaks and work on new things midweek to make the push for qualification this season.",
      "Amorim made three changes to his starting line-up, with Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu all returning in place of Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Benjamin Sesko, who drop to the bench.",

      "Perhaps the changes have been made in a bid to replicate their performance against Liverpool, where the lack of a focal point caused no end of problems for Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, or maybe Tottenham’s insipid display vs Chelsea prompted him to pack his team full of pressers to push a panicking Spurs into ceding possession as regularly as they did against the Blues.",
      "But after Amorim naming an unchanged side against Nottingham Forest for the first time in the Premier League was a landmark call to show why Manchester United should be in the running for a return to the Champions League, so too is this newfound will to do “something different”.",
      "It points to a level of comfort, from Amorim in his players and from his players in him. Having taken a very long time to come to terms with the basics of his philosophy, they’ve now reached a stage where Amorim believes he can make adjustments to the blueprint for individual games.",

      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",

      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Casemiro is in the final year of his Manchester United contract, 33 years old and it's fair to admit he's also past his pomp, but he is a crucial cog in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, five have come when Casemiro was on the pitch. The other 15 goals they've shipped have come without him. That pattern was clear in United's 2-2 draw at Spurs.",
      "Casemiro was taken off with less than 20 minutes to go and United leading through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header. Spurs then scored twice late on when he left the field.",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",

      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",

      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",

Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",
      "The fact they were able to do this against a side that could have gone nine points clear at the top of the Premier League had they won, speaks volumes about what the newly promoted side have been able to do. Both tonight and through the season to date.",

      "That could be the day Chelsea establish serious momentum. Or the day their shortcomings are underlined.",
      "In moments, this is a team so slick and brimming with potential. In others, they look stuck and short of ideas. The return to fitness of Cole Palmer should at least help with their final-third quality but issues at No 9 persist, with Liam Delap and Marc Guiu off the pace right now.",

      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role.

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",

      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
