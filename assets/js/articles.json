      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim praised Joshua Zirkzee for a much-improved second-half vs Crystal Palace, with the Dutchman the spark for the Red Devils' comeback win. Amorim's side came from behind to secure victory at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",
      "Jean-Phillipe Mateta had given Palace the lead from the penalty spot. But Zirkzee equalised shortly after the break with a well-taken strike for his first goal in 25 Premier League appearances.",
      "Mason Mount then flipped the game on its head to secure victory. But Amorim was full of praise for Zirkzee, after seeing an improved performance from the former Bayern Munich man after the break.",
      "\"The small things. The way that Josh [Zirkzee] controlled the ball in the second half was different. The way we defend second balls was different. So these small details make the difference and then the talent so we score two.\"",
      "On Zirkzee's performance in particular, the Portuguese coach, who had words with the Dutchman at half-time, added: “It’s so important for the strikers to score goals. He’s not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "Both of United's goals at Selhurst Park came from set pieces - Zirkzee and Mount getting on the end of creative free-kicks from Bruno Fernandes. It now means that United have scored from 10 set piece situations this season, the same amount as table-topping Arsenal.",
      "On that record, Amorim said: “It’s so important in our league because it's hard to play against every opponent. You can sense throw-ins, free-kicks, corners, to score a goal and open the game to give confidence to the team. In the Premier League, if you don’t work on set pieces, you are losing the game already.”",
      "United will be aiming to make it back-to-back wins next week. They take on West Ham at Old Trafford in midweek before a clash with struggling Wolves at Molineux.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United came from behind to win 2-1 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon - putting Monday night's dismal defeat to Everton behind them with an important win on the road.",
      "It wasn't easy for United however, who were lacklustre in the first period and fortunate to only go in one down at the break, after Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from the penalty spot. The Palace centre-forward had to retake his penalty after initially finding the net, but having only scored via a 'double-touch'.",
      "However, United boss Ruben Amorim watched Joshua Zirkzee get off the mark this season and score his first league goal since December with a fine low finish after 54 minutes to equalise. And nine minutes later, Mason Mount’s curled effort put the Red Devils in front.",
      "After an initial response by Palace, United held on relatively comfortably to make it four wins in seven to move into the top-half and only four points off rivals Manchester City.",
      "Here's how United's players rated at Selhurst Park on Sunday...",
      "Senne Lammens - 6",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "Leny Yoro - 3",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 5",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Shaw made a great block to deny Palace a two-goal advantage just before half-time. Not much attacking threat came down his side all afternoon, which was a compliment from the hosts. Booked for a professional foul.",
      "Amad - 5",
      "Was relocated to right-wing back, where he has looked comfortable, but he wasn't involved with the intricate play he is capable of orchestrating down that side. Could have done better.",
      "Casemiro - 5",
      "Amorim could not believe that Casemiro did not fire United into the lead just a minute into the match. The Brazilian wasted a header from a free-kick, but improved after a shaky start. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 7",
      "Fernandes is world-class because he creates something even when he is having an off day. Fernandes was responsible for both of United's assists from set-piece routines.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 7",
      "Dalot was recalled by default but made a difference with his long throw-ins, although it would have been difficult to have been a downgrade on Patrick Dorgu after his display against Everton.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 5",
      "Mbeumo was untouchable before the international break, but he hasn't returned with as much zest. He still worked hard down the right, but he is capable of more in the final third.",
      "Mason Mount - 8",
      "Made his first start since playing a key role in the win against Liverpool at Anfield. His performance was similar - hard working and industrious, but there was a key difference: he scored.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee - 7",
      "Offered nothing in the first half, following up a good touch with a bad one, but equalised with a brilliant finish. Zirkzee's half-volley had to be powerful to beat the goalkeeper - and it was.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui - 6 - He was an improvement on Yoro.",
      "Lisandro Martinez - 6 - Fine on his appearance since February.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - Same as Dorgu. N/A",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "But after the break, the Manchester United skipper played in Joshua Zirkzee for a stunning equaliser. And then Mason Mount smashed Fernandes’ short free-kick through the Palace wall for the winner which saw the Old Trafford club climb to sixth place before the later kickoffs.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been charged with getting the Old Trafford club back into Europe in his second season - and he risks becoming another ex-Manchester United manager if he fails.",
      "But not qualifying for European football next season will also have an impact on player recruitment. And £70m target Wharton, is understood only interested in moving to Old Trafford if they are in Europe - and this Fernandes-inspired win has increased the chances of that happening.",
      "The Portuguese star turned down the chance to move to the Saudi Pro League in the summer but he has an agreement that he can leave United for £57m next year for a foreign club.",
      "That money could finance a deal for Wharton - or for fellow England midfielder Elliot Anderson or Brighton’s Carlos Baleba. The former Blackburn Rovers midfielder, who is already playing in the UEFA Conference League, is always busy and looking for a forward pass.",
      "And he would add youthful energy to the Manchester United engine room with Fernandes now 31 and Casemiro 34 - although both played the full 90 minutes while Wharton went off after 78 minutes following his midweek appearance.",
      "But Wharton has yet to score for Crystal Palace - and he missed an open goal to open his account at Strasbourg on Thursday. And he shot straight at Manchester United keeper Senne Lammens in the first half when Palace should have killed this game off.",
      "The Brazilian also missed two early chances - including a header from another Fernandes free kick - but the two Manchester United midfielders are a goal threat.",
      "Declan Rice has added more goals to his game since moving from West Ham to Arsenal. And if he can stay fit, it is the area that Wharton can improve to become a regular for England - and a Premier League superstar.",

      "Manchester United have moved to within one point of the Premier League top four after coming from behind to beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "United found themselves behind once again at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's penalty. The Frenchman had been forced to retake his effort due to a double touch but was still successful at the second attempt.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee levelled matters shortly into the second half with his first Premier League goal since last December. United then completed the turnaround through Mason Mount as his low effort from range beat Dean Henderson.",
      "The victory leaves Ruben Amorim's side sixth in the table and just one point behind fourth-placed Sunderland, with Palace one point and a place behind the Red Devils. Here are all of the talking points from Selhurst Park:",
      "The story of the first quarter of the game was a number of half chances for both sides. United could actually have taken the lead within the opening few minutes.",
      "A rare long throw from the Red Devils caused chaos for the hosts and Casemiro looked sure to score, only to be denied by an excellent save from Dean Henderson.",
      "From that point on, Palace then seized mometum and had presentable chances through Adam Wharton, Mateta and Daichi Kamada - none of which were able to find the net.",
      "Following all of those missed chances, Palace then got the clearest opportunity of the game to open the scoring and it came from the penalty spot. An excellent pass from Wharton played Mateta through into the penalty area, with the striker tripped by compatriot Leny Yoro.",
      "Mateta was predictably the man to assume responsibility and converted with ease past Senne Lammens. But his celebrations were cut short after VAR had decided that Mateta had touched the ball twice in the process of scoring.",
      "A rule change allowed Mateta to retake the spot-kick and despite going a different way, it was still the same result as the forward stroked home, sending Lammens the wrong way.",
      "While Mateta has been scoring regularly for Palace over the past year, the same can't quite be said of Zirkzee at Man United. The Dutchman only scored three times in the Premier League last season and not once this - that was until he travelled to Selhurst Park.",
      "Shortly after the break, Zirkzee latched onto a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, controlled the ball with his chest and took a moment to compose himself. He then let fly with a powerful effort that zipped past Henderson and found the net.",
      "It represented Zirkzee's first goal in 25 Premier League games. And while he still has some work to do to show he can consistently lead the line for United in the absence of more established options, he will be thrilled to finally get on the scoresheet.",
      "United's leveller came from a set piece and was provided by a player who had struggled for form this season. And their second ended up coming in very similar circumstances.",
      "Another free-kick from Fernandes on the edge of the box was nudged towards substitute Mount, with his low shot going through the wall to nestle into the back of the net.",
      "It was the tenth goal that the Red Devils have scored from set pieces this season - the same amount as table-topping Arsenal.",
      "Palace have not had the best time of things in Europe this season. Oliver Glasner's side currently sit 18th in the Conference League after two wins and two defeats from their opening four games.",
      "And their European commitments appear to be having an impact on their domestic form, too. Palace have yet to win after a Conference League league stage game.",
      "Of course, for a side embarking on their first-ever European campaign, that was always bound to happen. But it's no doubt something that Glasner will want to fix sooner rather than later.",
      "It's been a long time out for Lisandro Martinez following his serious knee injury. But having been named on the bench at Selhurst Park, Amorim saw fit to introduce him for the final ten minutes.",
      "His introduction was greeted almost like a goal by the away end, as his is popularity. If he can recapture some of the form that he has already shown at Old Trafford, he will be a very useful readdition to the squad for the remainder of the campaign.",

      "Mateta was fouled by Leny Yoro and the referee pointed to the spot during the first half. Mateta scuffed his penalty into the bottom corner and the whole ground thought Palace had the lead.",
      "But VAR spotted Mateta had actually struck the ball into his standing foot before it bobbled into the goal. Before the start of this season, that would have resulted in an indirect free-kick to United.",
      "However, owing to a rule change before the current campaign, players are allowed to retake as long as their first effort went in the net.",
      "Because Mateta scored, he was allowed to retake the spot kick, and successfully swept it into the opposite corner to eventually give Palace the lead.",
      "United actually have a former Manchester City striker to blame for the rule change. In a dramatic penalty shootout between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in March, Julian Alvarez slipped and touched the ball twice while scoring past former Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois.",
      "Los Blancos went on to win the shootout 4-2 and progress to the next stage of Europe's elite competition amid chaos and controversy at the Metropolitano Stadium.",
      "UEFA called for a rule change and the International Football Association Board (IFAB) changed Law 14 to allow a “double-touch penalty” to be retaken if it was accidental - and the original kick was scored.",
      "Explaining the Mateta decision, referee Rob Jones told the crowd: \"After review, Crystal Palace 14, touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken penalty.”",
      "While it's the first instance of the rule being implemented in the Premier League, it has been seen elsewhere.",

The former Match of the Day host celebrates his 65th birthday this Sunday as fans continue to speculate about the iconic presenter's retirement.",
      "Lineker has had numerous memorable moments throughout his career, both on the football field and in the media. However, one moment that stands out is his blunt question following Manchester United's FA Cup win in 2023.",
      "The Red Devils defeated Manchester City 2-1 in the final with Ten Hag at the helm, and Lineker was quick to ask the important questions.",
      "The former Tottenham star directly asked Ten Hag: \"Do you think this was your last game?\" to which the Dutchman replied: \"I don't know. For me, this is a project. When I came in, we were a mess; now we are in a better state.\"",
      "The question stunned viewers and almost seemed like a premonition of the future. Following United's FA Cup win, Ten Hag struggled to continue a good run of form and was replaced by Ruben Amorim in November 2024.",
      "A poor league run ended with some European hope in the form of the Europa League final, but Lineker's old team had the last laugh as Ange Postecoglou hoisted the trophy high with a 1-0 win.",
      "Many things have changed for Lineker since that tense moment with Ten Hag. The former Barcelona star departed Match of the Day, a show he had been the main presenter of for 26 years.",
      "Lineker now devotes most of his time to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast alongside friends and fellow ex-footballers Alan Shearer and Micah Richards. The 65-year-old also managed one of the teams in Baller League, Deportrio, before quitting the six-a-side indoor football tournament before the second season began.",

      "The Portuguese boss admitted there had been nerves when Dorgu was in possession during recent matches. In his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: “He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball — I can feel it, the anxiety.",
      "“And I remember the shot [missed] against Everton. That was easier than the decision that he had to make when the guys from Scotland were there, when he made a great decision.",
      "“And I saw it when he played in Italy. But, again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.”",
      "\"They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.\"",
      "It comes after Dorgu appeared to ridicule the United manager on social media. Earlier in November, the full-back 'liked' an Instagram post which questioned Amorim's team selection.",
      "Victory today would lift United into the top six temporarily. Addressing that possibility, Amorim added: \"It's so important to win, but the most important thing is to be competitive in every single minute. The table now doesn't matter, we are too far from the end.\"",
      "The Red Devils head into this afternoon's clash languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League standings. Last week's loss to Everton proved particularly frustrating, with the Toffees playing most of the match with ten men.",
      "United will have to navigate today's fixture without three important players, with Benjamin Sesko still sidelined following an injury sustained in the draw at Tottenham. Harry Maguire, who was also pulled out during the Spurs match, will be absent as well.",

Earlier this month, Dorgu's Instagram account 'liked' a post criticising Amorim's team selection, sparking speculation about a possible rift between the two.",
      "The post included a screenshot of a comment from X which read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "There is no concrete evidence linking Amorim's decision to Dorgu's social media activity. However, the Denmark international had started United's previous two matches - a 1-0 loss to Everton and a 2-2 draw against Tottenham.",
      "Diogo Dalot has instead been given the nod at left-wing back, with Amad Diallo filling in on the right in front of a back-three consisting of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro. Dorgu, meanwhile, has had to settle for a place on the bench.",
      "\"They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.\"",
      "It comes after Amorim admitted that Dorgu, who missed a golden chance to equalise against Everton, was suffering a crisis of confidence. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" the Portuguese coach said.",
      "\"When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he's making in our team. I think it's the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "\"I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve.\"",
      "Dorgu was Amorim's first major signing at United, joining from Lecce for £25million midway through last season. He immediately became a regular figure in the side, with Amorim happily deploying him as the team's only out-and-out wing-back.",
      "However, periods of inconsistent form have tempered some of the excitement that followed his arrival. After starting five of United's opening league games this season, he was dropped to the bench for the following four.",
      "Although he returned to the starting line-up against Tottenham earlier this month, a disappointing display against Everton seems to have pushed him down the pecking order once again.",
      "United will be eager for three points after failing to win their last three league games. Monday's defeat to the Toffees ended a five-match unbeaten run, United's longest under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils head into the match sitting 12th in the table. A victory could lift them as high as fifth, but overcoming Crystal Palace will be no easy feat.",
      "United haven't won at Selhurst Park since 2020 and are winless in their last four encounters with the Eagles. Their most recent meeting ended in a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford in February, with Jean-Philippe Mateta scoring twice in the second half.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "He had an impressive start to life with the Red Devils but has struggled on occasion since. Giving his verdict on Dorgu’s form, United boss Amorim has said that he is trying to find a solution to help the defender perform to his true ability.",
      "“What I feel when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games,” Amorim said before adding: “When I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was different to the decision that he’s making in our team.",
      "“So I just need to understand the context in trying to help them. I think they are far from the best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I think they have so much more to give. Let’s see this week if we improve that.”",
      "Amorim also admitted that he can feel tangible anxiety every time Dorgu receives the ball - but hopes to see him become more comfortable. He said: “He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball — I can feel it, the anxiety.",
      "“And I remember the shot [missed] against Everton. That was easier than the decision that he had to make when the guys from Scotland were there, when he made a great decision.",

      "Should he be booked against Palace, then he will miss Thursday evening’s trip to West Ham United. He could also be in line for an awkward conversation with his boss, Amorim.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson once revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo was never handed the Manchester United captain's armband for one key reason: Wayne Rooney. The two iconic forwards shared a dressing room at Old Trafford for five years, during which they won three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League.",
      "Their relationship was friendly but fiercely competitive - a dynamic that, behind the scenes, required careful management. According to Gary Neville, who skippered the club between 2005 and 2010, Ferguson refused to let either Ronaldo or Rooney wear the armband to avoid any dressing room friction.",
      "\"I actually went to see Sir Alex in pre-season about the third year I was captain. We had an amazing team: Ronaldo, Rooney, [Carlos] Tevez, [Ryan] Giggs, [Paul] Scholes, [Rio] Ferdinand, [Nemanja] Vidic, [Patrice] Evra, [Edwin] van der Sar… there were some great personalities and players in that group.",
      "\"I went over to Sir Alex walking onto the training pitch and said, 'I don't feel worthy of keeping the captaincy anymore. This team is to a level I can't compete at'.",
      "\"He said, 'You'll keep that f***ing armband, son.' The reason he gave me: 'You and Giggs will rotate it. If I give it to Ronaldo, Rooney will kick off. If I give it to Rooney, Ronaldo will kick off. If I give it to Vidic, Ferdinand won't be happy'.",
      "\"So literally I think me and Giggsy kept it for three or four years beyond that just purely because of the fact the camaraderie in the dressing room. We were the policemen if you like, the older statesmen.\"",
      "Although Ferguson hesitated to name either Rooney or Ronaldo as permanent captains, both occasionally wore the armband when senior players were unavailable. Rooney was eventually appointed United's official captain in 2014, a year after Ferguson's retirement.",
      "He succeeded Nemanja Vidic, who had taken the armband from Neville in 2010. Rooney held the role for three years until leaving Old Trafford in 2017, a period that coincided with his tenure as England captain.",
      "Ronaldo, meanwhile, had to wait until the twilight of his career to become a club captain, receiving the armband after joining Al-Nassr in 2022. At international level, however, he has worn the Portugal captaincy for nearly two decades, having first been appointed in 2008.",
      "Following Rooney's departure, United went through four permanent captains in four years. Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young each served one-season stints before Harry Maguire brought a measure of continuity to the role in 2020.",
      "Maguire's tenure, though, was often clouded by controversy. A dip in form led some to question whether he was the right figure to lead the side. In 2023, he was stripped of the captaincy, which was subsequently handed to Bruno Fernandes.",

      "These earnings stem from multiple sources, including a fashion empire, ownership shares in football clubs such as Inter Miami and Salford City, as well as various other business pursuits.",
      "Victoria enjoyed her own celebrity status prior to meeting her future husband, whom she married in 1999, while David was an emerging talent at United.",
      "The Spice Girls ranked among the planet's most popular girl bands during that era, with Posh generating considerable income through music royalties and publishing deals.",
      "The 51-year-old subsequently launched her own fashion and beauty empire, though success didn't arrive immediately. Victoria revealed in the candid documentary 'Beckham' that, following losses totalling £66m, her husband, David, declined to invest additional funds in her brand until the tide turned.",

That's according to Fabrizio Romano, who claims the Brazilian has been added to United's target list.

      "Danny Simpson praised Gary Neville for his leadership when negotiating a contract at Manchester United. The former Red Devils captain ended up sorting out a new deal with Sir Alex Ferguson for the ex-right back.",
      "Simpson spent five years at Old Trafford, making the move up to the first team in 2005. Despite only making eight appearances in total for the former Premier League champions, the ex-defender did sort out a contract with the club when he made the jump to senior football - but this wasn't through the usual route.",
      "Typically, footballers negotiate professional contracts through their agents, but Simpson was too afraid to face the intimidating Ferguson to do so. The now 38-year-old decided to consult his captain, Neville, for some advice and found an unlikely agent through this method.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT's Inside Devils, Simpson said: \"Gary Neville actually negotiated my contract with Fergie. As a young kid, when you're starting to knock on the door and get around the first team, you're scared that you're going to annoy him.",
      "\"He'd go, 'I want to give you a new contract,' and you'd say to him, 'My agent will see you.' You were scared to say that. Whereas now it's the first thing you say.\"",
      "Simpson admits Neville showed his true colours by taking on this new role and securing a better deal for the fellow right-back than expected. He said: \"I'm thinking, 'If I say that, he's going to bin me off.' So I spoke to Gaz and Gaz was like, 'I'll go see him for you.'",
      "\"It was me, Gaz and Sir Alex in the room. I didn't really know what to do. So I'm just sat there in the middle. He (Neville) actually got me more money, to be fair. He actually didn't [ask for a cut]. The Gaz that you see now is always that Gaz.\"",
      "Neville's kindness in securing Simpson's contract showcases the leadership skills and generous nature that are still seen today. Despite faith being placed in the young defender at the time, Simpson spent most of his United career out on loan to the likes of Sunderland, Ipswich Town and Blackburn Rovers.",
      "Following a temporary spell at Newcastle, the defender made the permanent move to Tyne and Wear in 2010. He later transferred to Leicester City, where he was at his most successful.",
      "Simpson was part of the 2015/16 squad that were the unlikely winners of the Premier League under Claudio Ranieri. So despite never finding that dominant success under Fergie, the ex-footballer did secure silverware during his career.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits he wished he could go back to the Champions League semi-final in 2002 to score a goal so that he could \"shut up Roy Keane\" - who still gives him grief for his miss.",
      "For all Manchester United's dominance of the Premier League, players speak of several missed opportunities on the European stage with Sir Alex Ferguson claiming victory just twice across a period of success that spanned 30 years.",
      "One of the teams to oust them in the Champions League was Bayer Leverkusen, who made it all the way to the final that year. They downed United by virtue of away goals before losing to Real Madrid.",
      "They had drawn the first leg at Old Trafford 2-2 with Oliver Neuville scoring a late equaliser for the Germans, so United knew they were at an immediate disadvantage as they headed for the away leg. In Leverkusen they could only draw 1-1, Keane scoring for the Red Devils, but it wasn't enough.",
      "Diego Forlan saw an effort cleared off the line and shortly after Solskjaer was found in the box by Ryan Giggs, but the Norwegian rushed his chance and fired the bouncing ball over the crossbar from close range - something Keane still gives him grief for.",
      "Solskjaer told the BBC: \"There's one game I would love to play again and score a goal and shut Roy Keane up. So Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League semi-final. Every time I meet Roy, he mentions this chance that I missed. The ball is just behind me, its a half-volley, I hit it just over the bar and we lose on away goals. So every time I see Roy he mentions that one. So that's the one to change the history.\"",
      "United would finish that season trophyless as they were left to bemoan another Champions League chance that has passed them by. Even recently Keane was still referencing Solskjaer's miss.",
      "Speaking on Stick to Football the Irishman admits the miss still plagues his memories. He said: “I know you have to move on, but Bayer Leverkusen – I can still see Ole’s chance in that game. I bring it up when I see him now, I still mention the chance he missed! Forget how brilliant he was – I went, ‘f***ing hit the target!’”",
      "Solskjaer does have his name etched into United history books having scored the goal which won the Champions League in 1999. He appeared off the bench as United scored twice in the last two minutes to stun Bayern Munich in the Nou Camp.",

      "Marcus Rashford has finally seen his wish of playing at the Camp Nou for Barcelona granted. The England international appeared for the La Liga giants as a second-half substitute on Saturday against Alaves.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United forward had previously spoken of his desire to play in front of Barcelona fans at their iconic home ground, given Camp Nou has been undergoing £1.3billion redevelopment works and the Catalan titans had been unable to compete there as a result. Shortly after completing his move, Rashford said: \"It's a very nice feeling.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in.\"",
      "He added: \"But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "As a result of the redevelopment, Hansi Flick's side played their matches at the Olympic Stadium at the start of the season. However, that all changed last weekend, when the club was granted permission to re-open the Camp Nou for their 4-0 win over Athletic Club, albeit, at a limited capacity of around 45,000.",
      "Unfortunately for Rashford, however, he had to miss the homecoming game as a result of illness, instead watching from the side-lines. But the 28-year-old finally saw his dream come true on Saturday afternoon, gracing the hallowed turf of the iconic venue as a second-half substitute against Alaves in La Liga.",
      "Rashford replaced Marc Bernal at half-time during the match, which Barcelona achieved a 3-1 win in thanks to a goal from teenage wonderkid, Lamine Yamal, and a Dani Olmo brace. Since joining Barca, Rashford has managed six goals and nine assists from 17 appearances, as he looks to impress at his new club.",
      "Barcelona also have the option to make his move permanent next summer for a reported £26million, and they seem more likely than not to do so, given his impressive form as of late. The redevelopment of Camp Nou is set to be complete in 2027.",
      "The capacity of the stadium will then officially expand to 105,000, making it the fifth-biggest stadium in the world. The La Liga table toppers have also lodged an application with UEFA to request permission to move their remaining Champions League home games to the stadium.",
      "Up next for Barca is a home clash with Atletico Madrid come Tuesday, December 2, before they face Real Betis away four days later. Their next Champions League contest falls on Tuesday, December 9, when they face Eintracht Frankfurt on home soil.",

      "Manchester United are on a collision course with bitter rivals Real Madrid over Federico Valverde. Real superstar Valverde has emerged as a shock target of United.",
      "Valverde's Real future is in serious doubt following a bust-up with manager Xabi Alonso, with Uruguayan international one of several Real players said to be unhappy with Alonso's management style. Valverde is under contract until 2029, but is considering leaving the Spanish giants unless his relationship with Alonso improves. United are one of several clubs keeping close tabs on the situation.",
      "Ruben Amorim is a huge fan of Valverde's and would love to lure him to Old Trafford. But Real bosses have made it clear that if Valverde wants to leave, his price tag will be £100m.",
      "United value the 27-year-old closer to the £70m mark - and the two clubs remain a long way apart in their valuation of Valverde. United have a troubled relationship with Real when it comes to the transfer market.",
      "David De Gea's move to Real dramatically collapsed in 2015 - leaving both clubs blaming each other. While Sir Alex Ferguson, who was left devastated when Real signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009, once said he wouldn't sell Real \"a virus\".",
      "Alonso has also been seen clashing with Vinicius Jnr during the opening months of his spell at the Bernabeu, which comes at a time when the Brazilian is in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Despite all the politics the player turned manager insists nothing has surprised him about the Real job despite its demands. He said: “It’s turning out to be what I expected, a very demanding job. With moments when you need concentration, others when you need to react quickly. But I’m enjoying everything, the whole package that it entails.",
      "“It’s demanding, that’s clear. But I’m certainly not the first coach to have to deal with these situations. They’re not new situations. You have to know how to live with them.\"",

      "AS Roma want to rescue Joshua Zirkzee from his Manchester United nightmare - but the deal will depend on the Italian outfit agreeing a transfer fee with United next summer.",
      "Roma are willing to sign Zirkzee on a six-month loan in January, with a view to making the move permanent ahead of next season. But United are keen to recoup most of the £36m sum the forward cost them when joining from Bologna in 2024.",
      "Roma bosses, though, value Zirkzee closer to the £20m mark. Holland forward Zirkzee is desperate to find an escape route from Old Trafford, in a bid to boost his hopes of being involved in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Zirkzee has failed to make an impact at United, scoring just three goals in 37 league appearances. The 24-year-old wants to reignite his career, elsewhere and knows Roma could secure a place in the Champions League for next season.",
      "Zirkzee was handed a rare chance to impress in Monday night's chastening 1-0 home defeat against Everton with Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha sidelined. But he failed to make the most of it, with his performance leaving former Red Devils striker Michael Owen questioning if Zirkzee is the right for what Amorim wants his frontman to do.",
      "“I can’t watch him and get excited, I must admit,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Cunha missing today was a big blow. He was the closest to scoring for Man United but they are almost resorting to playing like this with hopeful crosses because he’s in there.",
      "“If you have Cunha playing, a different profile of player, you probably don’t go knocking crosses in all game. It’s not how Manchester United want to play and I always think if you start lumping the ball it becomes desperation.",

      "Manchester United won 2-1 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday. United needed to respond to a shocking defeat against Everton at the beginning of the week and they secured an important win on the road.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring in the 36th minute from the penalty spot. Leny Yoro clumsily brought the forward to the ground and Mateta fired Palace into a well-deserved lead.",
      "United equalised in the second half through Joshua Zirkzee before Mason Mount scored the winner.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Selhurst Park:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Shaw made a great block to deny Palace a two-goal advantage just before half-time. Not much attacking threat came down his side all afternoon, which was a compliment from the hosts. Booked for a professional foul. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Was relocated to right-wing back, where he has looked comfortable, but he wasn't involved with the intricate play he is capable of orchestrating down that side. Could have done better. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Amorim could not believe that Casemiro did not fire United into the lead just a minute into the match. The Brazilian wasted a header from a free-kick, but improved after a shaky start. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes is world-class because he creates something even when he is having an off day. Fernandes was responsible for both of United's assists from set-piece routines. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Dalot was recalled by default but made a difference with his long throw-ins, although it would have been difficult to have been a downgrade on Patrick Dorgu after his display against Everton. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo was untouchable before the international break, but he hasn't returned with as much zest. He still worked hard down the right, but he is capable of more in the final third. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made his first start since playing a key role in the win against Liverpool at Anfield. His performance was similar - hard working and industrious, but there was a key difference: he scored. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Offered nothing in the first half, following up a good touch with a bad one, but equalised with a brilliant finish. Zirkzee's half-volley had to be powerful to beat the goalkeeper - and it was. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "He was an improvement on Yoro. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Fine on his appearance since February. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Arrived late on. N/A",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Same as Dorgu. N/A",

      "Ruben Amorim hurried to the Selhurst Park dressing room at half-time. Manchester United were trailing 1-0 after an awful first half. Whatever Amorim said to the players worked when play resumed.",
      "The good work of October was in danger of being undone by an awful November, but United clawed their way back into the game, winning the battle of endurance against a tired Crystal Palace. The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "United had won just one of their last 11 Premier League away games - against Liverpool at Anfield last month. Speaking during the pre-match press conference, Amorim admitted he didn't know why his team struggles on the road, but he said that his players need to learn how to \"finish games\".",
      "Amorim axed Patrick Dorgu from his starting line-up following his admission that he senses \"anxiety\" from the defender when he's on the ball. Diogo Dalot came into the team, but the Portugal international has also been unconvincing at left wing-back this season.",
      "Shea Lacey, 18, was the only attacking option on the bench. Kobbie Mainoo has played as a No.10 in Amorim's system, but the United boss has confirmed he views him as a deep midfielder. Only Arsenal (six) had conceded fewer goals than Palace (nine) in the Premier League this season, and United had been hopeless in the final third against Everton earlier in the week.",
      "But United still had no excuse not to pose a threat on Sunday. Palace were in European action against Strasbourg in France on Thursday, meaning they had just two days to prepare, compared to United's five days of preparation at Carrington, so the Reds rocked up to Selhurst Park with an immediate advantage.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo gave Amad a pat on the back as the players returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off. Amad assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and it felt like their relationship could be key again. As it turned out, United managed to claim a win despite the pair not being at their best.",
      "Dalot contributed more in the first 30 seconds than Dorgu had in 58 minutes against Everton, launching a long throw-in into the box, which Casemiro remarkably did not find the net from.",
      "The away section belted out '12 Days of Cantona' for two obvious reasons: December is now just around the corner and United were playing at the scene of the infamous kung fu kick.",
      "Amorim looked frustrated as Palace began to carve out opportunities. He paced up and down the touchline and was reminded by the fourth official to stay within his area. Then Mbeumo was shown a yellow card for throwing the ball to the ground, clearly frustrated at how the game was unfolding.",
      "Adam Wharton sent a shot straight at Senne Lammens from the edge of the box, Jean-Philippe Mateta missed a sitter after a mistake from Yoro, and Yeremy Pino was stunned to see his effort blocked by Yoro in a later move. Yoro managed to redeem himself for his blunder leading to Mateta's chance.",
      "Mateta continued to ask questions. He bullied Matthijs de Ligt and drew another mistake from Yoro, who needlessly fouled him in the box from a position that was never going to yield a clean challenge.",
      "The penalty was converted - but there was a double touch and VAR ordered it to be retaken. That rule needs to change because the opponent should not be given another bite at the cherry after botching the first penalty. Nonetheless, Mateta scored his second penalty.",
      "\"Boom, boom, Mateta's in the room,\" was chanted twice to the tune of the Vengaboys hit. The double embarrassment should have sparked a response, but the white shirts limped into the interval. Amad and Mbeumo were not at the races, and United do not tend to fire when the pair underperform.",
      "Luke Shaw shook his head as the whistle went for half-time. Shaw has been at United for 11 years and was making just his 300th appearance for the club. The defender has played for five permanent managers during his time at Old Trafford and might have been close to playing for another if the Reds had not completed a comeback. There will not be another inquest come on Monday morning.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both had the desired effect. Dalot had a great game and Mason Mount finished brilliantly to fire United into a 2-1 lead. It was a brave decision from Amorim to stick with Joshua Zirkzee, but even that call was vindicated by the Dutchman's well-taken half-volley to equalise.",
      "Zirkzee's shot had to be powerful to beat Dean Henderson - and it was. Zirkzee has not looked like a striker since his arrival from Bologna, but he will be alright if he can score more goals like that for United.",
      "The Everton performance was shocking and Amorim needed to produce an answer. He did.",

Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from the spot in the 32nd minute. United were awful in the first half and the hosts thoroughly deserved their one-goal advantage at the interval.",
      "United looked like a different team when play resumed. Joshua Zirkzee equalised, firing his half-volley beyond Dean Henderson, and Mason Mount made it 2-1 from another set-piece routine.",
      "The Reds are now level with Arsenal with the joint-most set-piece goals in the top flight this season, having scored 10 goals from set-play scenarios just 13 games into the campaign.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United had put more work into set-pieces during training, and he said: \"No, we work a lot. We have more time to work, we work a lot and we learn a lot in England.",
      "\"I think you are used to seeing that, but when you come for the Premier League you learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals. \"",
      "Amorim discussed what he said to the players at half-time, saying: \"It's just to understand for everyone to understand the game. I felt in the last ten minutes of the first half, I felt that the opponent was struggling and they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling that we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"And it was that, of course. We tried to change little things in the game. But the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh in our connection, was better and that improves a lot the way we play.\"",
      "When asked whether he believed United could turn the game around, he said: \"I felt that because I had the feeling that if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box and you can feel it the way they move.",
      "\"They were getting tired for the second half and we talked about that. And again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League. So we increased that and I had the feeling that if we score one goal this is going to change completely.",
      "\"I really like also the way we controlled the game with the ball, winning the game. So we were in front but we were not afraid of trying to score the next one and to control the ball in their half.\"",
      "Amorim believes the lack of intensity in the first half was due to 'small details'. \"Sometimes it's a lot of things,\" he added. \"Sometimes you don't need to move but the pace of the ball can be better.",
      "\"You need to understand that Mateta was the man that had the time to think and if you see in the second half, sometimes it was him that starts the play. All these small details I think we improved. And when you have one play, two plays, the rhythm flows better and you increase everything mentally and physically.\"",

      "Manchester United have returned to winning ways as they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1.",
      "United were second best in the first half and went behind with ten minutes remaining as Jean-Philippe Mateta was clumsily brought down by Leny Yoro. After VAR ordered a retake due to a double touch, the striker scored from the spot.",
      "But after the break United made their fresher legs count. They equalised from nothing as Bruno Fernandes’ free kick picked out Joshua Zirkzee who composed himself before firing in.",
      "Moments later the game was turned on its head. Fernandes laid off a free kick for Mason Mount to fire home through a crowd and the Reds did well to hold on and claim a big three points on the road.",
      "Follow all the reaction and look back at the highlights below…",
      "\"Great feeling, it’s always a good feeling but most importantly just got us back into the game and this guy [Mount] scored a pretty good goal after. It was all about three points today, just very happy we got them.",
      "\"It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform so if you don’t score for a long time it can get to you but I’m surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day.",
      "\"So they made it quite easy for me and today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work, trying to be consistent and I’m just thankful to them.\"",
      "\"We’ve not found it easy away from home this season, obviously a very difficult result in the last game so we knew we needed to bounce back.",
      "\"That’s what we spoke about before the game, I thought we showed good character to come back after the 1-0 down first half so it was about reacting in the changing room. Second half, and I thought we did that really good. We came out and we were at it.",
      "\"I’m feeling good, the win obviously was massive but also for me to play the full game, I can’t remember, I haven’t done that in a while. I’ve been feeling really good recently, no problems, I’m enjoying my football and when you have days like this in front of fans like this it makes it all worth it.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim hurried to the Selhurst Park dressing room at half-time. Manchester United were trailing 1-0 after an awful first half. Whatever Amorim said to the players worked when play resumed.",
      "The good work of October was in danger of being undone by an awful November, but United clawed their way back into the game, winning the battle of endurance against a tired Crystal Palace. The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "Read the full report here >>>",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Read the ratings here>>>",
      "That's it, United hold on for a big three points. Zirkzee and Mount with the goals in the second half win it.",
      "Devenny hits it and into the wall",
      "Hughes is brought down by Casemiro in a dangerous position",

      "Amad, Mbeumo OFF",
      "Dorgu, Mainoo ON",

      "Wharton, Pino OFF",
      "Hughes, Uche ON",

      "Mazraoui rolls Guehi and is brought down by the Palace man, booking given and now a dangerous free kick to come.",
      "Shaw is booked for a foul but United aren't happy. Dalot looked to be fouled at the other end of the pitch by Richards moments before.",
      "Deep ball into the area is flicked on by Nketiah but the ball drops wide.",
      "De Ligt clatters Mateta as they go for the ball and the free kick is given.",
      "United going for the kill now as Amad cuts inside but fires over",
      "GOAL UNITED. Mason Mount. Fernandes over a free kick after Dalot was fouled. He steps up and lays it off for Mount to fire in!",
      "Mateta gets some luck and charges towards goal but he fires it over the bar",
      "This is where United's fresh legs could count. Palace feeling the effects of midweek and the Reds look the better team. If they can grab another, it would be impressive.",
      "Mazraoui clears the ball, it hits Zirkzee and goes just behind for a corner",
      "Yoro OFF",
      "Mazraoui ON",
      "Goal United from nothing. Zirkzee! Good free kick by Fernandes finds Zirkzee, he composes himself and fires in.",

United have made two changes for the game this afternoon with the duo coming in to replace Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Amorim said in his press conference there was anxiety when Dorgu was on the ball for the Reds. But when asked why he had made his changes, the Portuguese head coach said it was based on what he had seen at Carrington.",
      "He told BBC Sport: \"It's the way you train. They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.\"",
      "Should United win, they will move into the top six for a few hours at least. On that prospect, Amorim added: \"It's so important to win, but the most important thing is to be competitive in every single minute. The table now doesn't matter, we are too far from the end.\"",
      "If United are to record a positive result this afternoon, they will need to do so without three key players. Benjamin Sesko remains injured after picking up an issue in the draw at Tottenham.",
      "Harry Maguire was also withdrawn against Spurs and he also misses out. Matheus Cunha picked up an injury in training before Everton and Amorim has confirmed the Brazilian is expected back for the clash with West Ham on Thursday.",

The Leicester City icon was spotted in the stands during United's 2-1 comeback against the Eagles, with Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount both on the scoresheet.",
      "His son George also took to Instagram to wish Gary a happy birthday, writing: \"Happy birthday to the old man. Keep smashing it.\" Gary promptly shared the post on his Instagram stories.",
      "Lineker has been out of a job since his high-profile exit from Match of the Day in May. By the time of his exit, he had become the programme's longest-serving presenter, leading the BBC's flagship football show from 1999 to 2025.",
      "Last month, Lineker confirmed he would return to television to front ITV’s new show The Box. The show will be filmed later this year and aired in 2026.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes he can sense \"anxiety\" from Manchester United defender Patrick Dorgu when he receives the ball. Dorgu has been in and out of the team this season. He was recalled to the line-up against Tottenham and retained his starting berth against Everton, but was brought off in the 1-0 defeat.",
      "The 21-year-old signed from Lecce in the January transfer window for €30million (£25m), with a potential €5m (£4m) in add-ons, and is still trying to find his feet in Manchester. Diogo Dalot started at left wing-back in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton during an excellent October, but the Portugal international disappointed against Nottingham Forest.",
      "The mixed form of Dorgu and Dalot means there has not been a settled starter at left wing-back. Amorim was asked whether left wing-back could be a position to strengthen at the end of the season, and said: \"Guys, we have time to think about that, I don't know what is going to happen in January.",
      "\"What I feel, when I see them training, they are doing so much better than in games. Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland. The decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision that he is making in our team, so I just need to understand the context and try to help them.",
      "\"I think they are far from the best and they know it. So like a lot of players in our team, like myself, so I just look at them and I think they have so much more to give.\"",
      "Amorim pointed to that goal Dorgu scored for Denmark against the Scots when asked whether the Dane needed to improve his end product. And the United boss said he senses Dorgu is anxious in possession.",
      "\"I think it's the decision [making],\" Amorim said. \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make against the guys [for Denmark] from Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Another player who Amorim has challenged to improve is Kobbie Mainoo. \"This is a team sport. You talk a lot about Kobbie and I have more players in my squad that want to be in the World Cup, so it's a little but unfair. I put Kobbie because he's really good near the box,\" added Amorim.",
      "\"To have a guy like him and Bruno, they can find spaces near the box and score goals, so that was also my idea. I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try get the team to win.",
      "\"I'm not focused on one individual. I want to help all my players and I know how special it is for a player to play at the World Cup, but my job is to focus on the team and win as a team. Kobbie Mainoo is in the same situation as the other guys. If I feel it's the best way to win the game, I will do it.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he considers Mainoo as a starter and responded: \"I see him as a starter, like the other guys, but I have to make a choice and in the end, it's not been Kobbie. But in the future, I don't know. I always say the same thing with Casemiro. He was not playing. And then he plays. I just want to win games, I don't care who is playing.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League this season. The midfielder's only start of the campaign came against Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the Carabao Cup second round.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window for the sake of regular minutes, but Amorim blocked the request and explained that Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes. Mainoo has made eight appearances from the bench in the league this season.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that he was \"angry\" when he said he was \"afraid of returning\" to the feeling of last season following Manchester United's shocking defeat to Everton. Amorim was named manager of the month for October in the Premier League, but his side have started November with two draws and an awful defeat to Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "The Toffees had 10 men for 77 minutes, but they still claimed three points. Amorim set alarm bells ringing during his post-match press conference when he said: \"I feel afraid of returning this feeling of last season.\" When asked about that quote four days later, Amorim explained: \"We just need not to think so far ahead. I said that because losing, I always have that feeling of frustration, being angry all the time, and I don't want to have that feeling. My life is so much harder when I have that feeling.",
      "\"The same thing I said when we were winning - that is in the past. And you guys were trying to push more for me, and I always said the same thing. That is in the past, everything can change. I will say the same thing. We didn't win the last one, which is a problem for a big club, so let's win the next one. It will be really tough but let's go.\"",
      "Amorim thought United were 'soft' against Everton. \"It depends on the way you play the game, some teams play with four central defenders,\" he added, initially discussing the team's defensive record. \"I play with three, one of them is Luke Shaw, sometimes we play with Nouss and Luke Shaw. We play with one centre back if we play with Amad at wing-back. He is not a wing-back, he is a winger.",
      "\"So it depends on how you see things. Then if you understand all the data, we have some results of not getting a lot of teams in some games to get in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box. So we need to improve that, especially in the last games, like against Nottingham.",
      "\"We took a lot of crosses. We didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, of course they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal and we suffered a goal with their only shot on target. Things can change the way you see things, but of course we have to improve a lot of things.",
      "\"We need to close our goals, because we are scoring goals - not in the last one. I think it's an issue not about the defenders, it's about the team and the way we feel the danger near our box.\"",
      "He added: \"When I say soft, it's the goal of Everton. We are there, near the box, we have more guys than Everton, we should be better and more strong on the duels.",
      "\"Crystal Palace are really strong with the duels every time one against one, they are really strong, so if we need to take something from our opponent, we need to be strong on that also.\"",
      "Amorim delved into the goals United have conceded this season, saying: \"If you think, for me, it's not just the numbers, it's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that is the concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive, so that is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers, it's the way you see the game. We should have more points and the narrative should be different. Imagine if we'd won the game against Everton? The conversation would be . . . You'd be here asking me about top four. It was one game, one shot on goal, so we need to understand this club is different to any other club. Let's do everything to avoid this.\"",

The Eagles were awarded a spot-kick when Leny Yoro fouled Mateta in the area. The striker took up to take the penalty, and put the ball into the bottom left hand corner.",
      "But replays showed a slight double touch. Announcing that decision on the pitch, referee Rob Jones said: \"After review, Crystal Palace 14 touches the ball twice and the ball goes into the net. It's going to be a retaken penalty.\"",
      "In earlier seasons, the situation would have resulted in United being awarded an indirect free-kick.",
      "However, a review of the rules earlier this year means that an accidental double touch now results in the penalty being retaken. It's the first time in the Premier League that the new rule has been implemented.",
      "The change came after former Man City forward Julian Alvarez saw a penalty goal disallowed for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Champions League.",
      "The rule was seen in the Women's Euro 2025 final. England star Beth Mead was forced to retake her penalty in the shootout, but saw her second attempt saved.",
      "Mateta again stepped up to retake the penalty. He sent the ball past Senne Lammens again and into the opposite bottom corner to give Palace a 1-0 lead.",
      "Following the incident, the Premier League confirmed via their Match Centre X - formerly Twitter - account that a VAR review recommended the original penalty goal to be overturned with a retake taking place.",
      "The PL statement read: \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of goal to Crystal Palace. Referee announcement: \"After review, Crystal Palace 14, touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken.\"",

      "The report claims that higher-ups at the Etihad Stadium are 'big admirers' of Anderson, whose contract at the City Ground expires in June 2029. It's said that City have even had scouts in the East Midlands to monitor his development.",
      "It is believed Forest will look to reject all advances from potential suitors in January, even they they receive bids in the region of £100m. The likes of City and United, among other English top-flight outfits, believe a fee in excess of £80m will be enough to sway owner Evangelos Marinakis.",
      "Fortunately for Ruben Amorim, who's in the market for a new midfielder, Pep Guardiola's immediate priority is thought to be a winger. Antoine Semenyo, valued by Bournemouth at £65m, has been considered by City in what could lead to a sensational £165m double swoop.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing, as quoted by Caught Offside, United have contacted the representatives of Vinicius Junior ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window. The 25-year-old winger faces a somewhat uncertain future at Real Madrid, having recently entered the final two years of his contract.",
      "City are reportedly 'likely' to rival the Reds in the race for Vinicius Jr's signature if he decides to leave the Santiago Bernabeu.",
      "Contrary to reports in England, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo has claimed the Brazil international has actually agreed to reduce his wage demands during talks over a new deal with Los Blancos.",
      "Jake bumped into Luke Shaw at Nando's on his 14th birthday and told him to join Chelsea. The left-back joined Manchester United a few weeks later. Coincidence? Who knows.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Matheus Cunha and Harry Maguire will be unavailable for Manchester United's game against Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Last weekend, Cunha pulled out of an appearance to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham with event organisers posting on social media that he would not attend due to “medical reasons”.",
      "United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him to miss the Everton game on Monday night.",
      "Maguire was absent against Everton due to the hamstring injury he picked up against Tottenham before the November international break. The defender was brought off in the 72nd minute of that game.",
      "Benjamin Sesko remains sidelined with a knee injury. Amorim confirmed at last week's press conference that he expects to have Sesko available again before Wolves on December 8, but he said the striker may need more time.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little more time,\" said Amorim. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time], but I expect to have Matheus in the next one, not this one. It will take a little bit longer - we will take care of the injury.\"",
      "United's undefeated run of five games was ended by Everton earlier in the week. The Toffees played 77 minutes with 10 men at Old Trafford but were still able to claim a victory.",
      "\"It was really tough, the week was hard with this result, this defeat, but the process needs to continue and we need to go to the next game,\" said Amorim about the Everton defeat.",
      "\"If I look at the games, we should have more points. We had the advantage in some games and we lost control, which is really disappointing and frustrating, especially after the last game.\"",
      "Palace were defeated 2-1 by Strasbourg in the Europa Conference League on Thursday night.",

      "Ruben Amorim admitted he doesn't know why Manchester United have such a poor record when playing away from home in the Premier League, but said his team need to know how to \"finish games\". United have won just one of their previous 11 away Premier League outings. That victory came against Liverpool at Anfield last month.",
      "Amorim's side suffered a shock defeat to Everton at the beginning of the week, and they must produce a response when they play Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park this weekend. United will need to find a way to improve their record on the road if they are to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "\"We need to show the players why we lost control against Nottingham, why we lost control against Tottenham, so if you look at those games, they were there to win,\" said Amorim. \"So sometimes a small detail can change anything. I've felt the intensity at home has been higher. But against Everton, it was not on the same level.",
      "\"I think it's something we need to work on, so it's hard to point why we aren't winning away. There are a lot of issues we are improving and we need to know how to finish the games to win.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"In our club, it’s the same because last year we had to win every game all the time, and we took a lot of things, a lot of criticism because we were not winning. There are no excuses. About Europe, I've already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe. And I say the same thing this year: there are advantages and disadvantages of not being in Europe, so there are no excuses last year or this year, we always have to win games.\"",
      "Reacting to the Everton loss, he said: \"I think if you look at the game, we can play better, we could be better and everything that happened in that game, we should have won that game, and we have to have that urgency of winning games. So we know what happens around the club if we don't win games.",
      "\"If we know that, let's do everything in the right way. But we lost that one, we cannot change that, so let's focus.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday lunchtime.",
      "Amorim confirmed he will be missing Benjamin Sesko as expected for the game at Selhurst Park. Matheus Cunha is also out but could be fit in time for the midweek fixture against West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of the game as he takes further time to recuperate from the injury he received at Tottenham. Amorim was also quizzed about the comparisons that can be drawn between United and Palace as they both play the same 3-2-4-1 system.",
      "The topic of signing wing-backs was also mentioned but Amorim was keen not to delve too deeply into replacing specific positions. Meanwhile, questions were asked about the club's away form and what can be done to improve that.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below:",
      "That is all from the first part of Amorim's press conference. Those first quotes have been tidied up now.",
      "We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I say that in the last year and to give an example, the last game, we should have had enough with the right foot to put on the other side to play against ten men. It is these kind of characteristics, with time, we will try to get to be a better team so are we the perfect set-up to play in this way? Not yet but like every team we need time to put the right characteristics into every position to prepare them.",
      "I don't know how you read data [on Palace wing-backs] maybe they play more games, more minutes so you can't compare the data. We make a lot of substitutions and sometimes we change because we know that is a different position or you want to change the feet with Dalot and Patrick. Sometimes we start with Amad in front but most of the time if we need to win the game, I put Amad on the right. Amad changes position all the time and that can change all the data and you see different things. But again, they are doing the things really well. They play more in transition than us. The opponents see it in a different way so all of these things we have to look when we compare teams. But in every position we can do so much better.",
      "We play a different way and you can understand that by data but it is hard to explain everything. It is a different club and they are doing that better than us so that is quite simple but you don't say all 4-3-3 play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in different space and we try to attack in a different way and they are just doing things better than us.",
      "I play against him [Glasner] at Frankfurt with Sporting so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I have two weeks for national teams, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration that I can take. I have six years as a manager and I am always trying to learn to improve my team.",
      "The same things that we need to do to show to the players why we lost control of Forest why we lost control against Tottenham. And if you look at those games they were there to win. Sometimes a small detail can change everything. Then I felt this year when we play at home the intensity is higher and I felt in this game at home the intensity was not at the same level so I think it is something that we need to work on. It is hard to point at one thing why we are not winning away. There is a lot of issues that we are improving. Like I say, we have advantage in the away games but we need to know how to finish the games in order to win.",
      "If you look at the game we can play better. Everything that happened in that game, we should have won that game, we have to feel that urgency of winning games. We know what happens around the club if we do not win games. If we know that, let's do everything in the right way but again, we lost that one. We cannot change that, let's focus on the next one.",
      "Sesko is going to take a little bit more time, Harry [Maguire] the same. I expect to have Matheus back in the next one not this one.",
      "No, no, no setback [for Sesko]. We are taking care of the injury.",
      "It is to start again and it was really tough the week as it should be. It was hard after this result, this defeat. But the process needs to continue and we need to go for the next game and we have to understand, especially in our league this year, everything can change really fast so let's go again and focus on the next one.",
      "In our club it is the same thing because last year we had to win every game all the time and we took a lot of criticism because we are not winning. So in our club there is no excuses. About Europe, I have already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe, and I say the same thing this year, the advantage and disadvantage of being in Europe so there is no excuses. Last year or this year it is always to win games.",
      "If I look at the games we should have more points because we had control of some games, we had the advantage in some games and we lost that control. So if I look at our games we should have more points and that is really disappointing and really frustrating especially in the last game.",
      "Amorim is here and it is time for the press conference. Keep an eye out for updates shortly...",
      "Amorim has just started speaking to the United press pack at Carrington. Remember the press conference is embargoed until 1.30pm but we will get you the quotes as soon as we can!",
      "Amorim surprised many of us on Monday when he chose to start Zirkzee as the No.9 against Everton. Before that game, he had only played 90 minutes over five appearances but it was a show of confidence from the manager to throw him in. Sadly, the risk did not work and the United boss could be asked questions over where he sees Zirkzee starting at Palace.",
      "Here is what we expect Amorim to be asked about and speak on in his press conference this afternoon:",
      "We are just one hour away from Amorim's press conference being broadcast. The Portuguese head coach will be speaking to the media at 1.15pm with the embargo being lifted at 1.30pm. Stay tuned for the updates from Carrington right here...",
      "United believes the chance to host the FIFA 2035 women's World Cup is a \"brilliant opportunity.\" United and the city region have been aligned with the aim of bringing significant fixtures at the World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final of the tournament. United withdrew Old Trafford from the list of venues for the 2028 men's European Championship because they were considering its future and could not commit to being a host venue. However, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has earmarked the 2030/31 season for United to move into the new 100,000-seater Old Trafford.",

      "Teenage midfielder Cristian Orozco is set to travel to the United Kingdom ahead of his move to Manchester United, who have a preliminary agreement to sign the Colombian. Orozco, 17, plays for Fortaleza CEIF and has captained Colombia's Under-17 team. The defensive midfielder helped Colombia reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring, and United have identified him as an exciting young talent with first-team potential.",

      "Another game, another potential United audition in the opposition ranks. This time it is the turn of Palace's Wharton to take centre stage as the Reds continue to have an eye on midfield options. MEN Sport has taken a look at why the audition may not necessarily be a ringing endorsement for signing the England international.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In an interview with DAZN Portugal this week, Amorim admitted he is willing to change his tactic despite criticism he is too wedded to the 3-2-4-1 system. The Portuguese head coach could be quizzed on this in his press conference later and it will be interesting to see how he responds.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Heading into today's press conference we can expect to hear about the latest on the injury issues affecting United. Sesko is likely to be overlooked considering Amorim put a timeline of 'a few weeks' on his potential return. Cunha and Maguire have more chance of being fit for Sunday. Maguire was training at Carrington during the international break but his recovery needed longer. Cunha's injury was deemed 'nothing serious' on Monday night so there's a chance he could play Sunday.",
      "United are looking to bounce back this weekend against Palace after the dismal display vs Everton. Their best chance of doing that would be to have their strongest line-up available to them for the trip to Selhurst Park. However, our United writer Steven Railston believes the club needs a double injury boost to be able to do just that.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will address the media today and we will have his quotes at 1.30pm.",
      "Amorim's attitude today will be interesting after his players put in a poor performance in the defeat to Everton on Monday night. The Reds desperately need a response on Sunday to show the result was merely a blip after a good run of form.",

And the enticing prospect in my mind is if we really get it moving, I think there’s a fairly high likelihood that we will be hosting the women’s FIFA World Cup in 2035.

      "As reported by The Sun, the players have been training with the first-team due to the heavy workload for the U21s, including behind-closed-doors matches. Gabriel is said to have taken part in training on Thursday.",
      "Despite impressing for the Under-18s, and making the step up, he will be unable to make his first-team debut until January at the earliest.",
      "That's due to Premier League rules stating that a player must have turned 15 by August 31 to feature this term with Gabriel only turning 15 last month.",
      "The same rules doesn't apply in the FA Cup, meaning the teenager could potentially make his debut for the United first-team in the third round of the competition.",
      "Amorim could still have the chance to give another young player their big chance - with the other players spotted in training old enough to feature in the Premier League.",

      "Cunha, 26, joined United from Wolves in a deal worth £62.5million in June but has endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford, having struggled with injuries and fitness-related issues. Indeed, the ex-RB Leipzig man has scored just one in 11 appearances for United, though his minutes have been managed at times.",
      "However, despite Cunha's struggles, he's still a popular pick on Fantasy Premier League (FPL). Before United's game against Everton, Cunha was brought in by more than 50,000 managers,- having proved his fitness after starting four successive Premier League matches in a row before the international break.",
      "He accumulated 17 points in that period - a run that many FPL players felt would continue or, perhaps, get better - heading into a good-looking set of fixtures on paper, with West Ham and Wolves to come after Palace.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "A game which allowed for a like-for-like comparison between managers and players in the same system saw Ruben Amorim and Manchester United overwhelmingly pale in that comparison to their Crystal Palace counterparts in the first half, before they took full advantage of their hosts’ malaise after the break to claim victory.",
      "As Jean-Philippe Mateta bulldozed his way through the United defence the ball was frequently seen bouncing off Joshua Zirkzee on at the other end, as Maxence Lacroix treated the maligned Red Devil’s attacking presence with the disdain it deserved with a dominating display completely at odds with that of Matthijs de Ligt, who shrunk in the presence of the Palace striker.",
      "Luke Shaw continued to ‘amble’ and so too did Marc Guehi, but the latter in a peak Virgil van dijk ‘I’m better than you’ sort of way rather than the former’s tribute to the current ‘his legs have gone’ iteration of the Liverpool captain.",
      "The most damning contrast came in midfield, where Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes routinely played passes to where teammates could and perhaps should have been but weren’t, often into spaces actually occupied by Crystal Palace players, as Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada showed them how that midfield pivot can function effectively.",
      "Wharton is inarguably the star man in the pairing. His excellent round-the-corner pass for Mateta before Leny Yoro tumbled into the striker to concede the penalty was one of many examples in the first half of his forward-first desire and ability.",
      "As both Casemiro and Fernandes dawdled on the ball, Wharton – and to a lesser but still notable extent Kamada – didn’t hand their opposite numbers the opportunity to catch them in possession as they did to them. It works because, unlike the United duo, they can both do everything, albeit with varying levels of quality.",
      "Mateta could easily have scored a couple more and Palace really should have been at least two up at the break as Eddie Nketiah ran in sand to deny himself a clear opportunity to score in stoppage-time. A United comeback looked incredibly unlikely.",
      "They were better in the second half and showed plenty of the “fight” Amorim was desperate for after the defeat to Everton. Crucially, they were playing for the manager.",
      "But it did feel as though their superiority was more down to Palace’s dwindling reserves of energy than their own uptick in intensity.",
      "Oliver Glasner’s side hadn’t won any of their previous three Premier League clashes after Thursday night Conference League commitments, losing to Everton and Arsenal, and drawing with Brighton. And they looked as though they had quite simply run out of gas after their 2-1 away defeat to Strasbourg.",
      "Eight of the starting XI for the midweek game started here and while Wharton only played an hour in France, his downturn in the second half was as notable as anyone’s, and he was hooked with 15 minutes to go here as Palace searched for an equaliser after Casemiro and Fernandes wrestled control in the second half.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Man Utd: Mainoo ‘says yes’ to transfer as Romano confirms ‘deal sealed’ for first 2026 signing\n👉 Man Utd ‘present offer’ to hijack Liverpool transfer with one club ‘leading race’ for one reason\n👉 Rashford to Barcelona roadblock prompts Arsenal interest; sees PSG ‘test’ Man Utd with £61m swap offer",
      "Zirkzee wouldn’t have emerged for the second half had Amorim had any options on the bench to replace him. He probably wouldn’t have been playing if that had been the case. But it was a glorious finish from Fernandes’ free-kick as he controlled on his chest and smashed the ball across Dean Henderson from a tight angle.",
      "He’s not the answer for United, as he made abundantly clear through much of what he did in this game. But he made the difference in a moment, as Mason Mount did with a drilled shot after a short Fernandes pass from another free-kick to draw United level with Arsenal at the top of the charts with ten goals from set pieces this term.",
      "And in what Arsenal have shown to be a tried-and-tested method of picking up Premier League wins for much of this season, United followed up their set-piece goals with some solid defending.",
      "Has Amorim therefore in fact got United on the same path imperiously trodden by Mikel Arteta’s side on their way to Premier League dominance? They played similarly safe, often boring football before a recent surge in quality and impact from open play.",
      "The lack of any distinguishable attacking pattern whatsoever suggests that if that is the case there’s a helluva way to go a year on from Amorim’s appointment.",
      "But at the very least, in what should be a given but hasn’t been and certainly wasn’t in the first half here, United won this game by – as Amorim said afterwards – “fighting for every ball”, albeit against an opponent with little fight left in them.",
      "Ruben Amorim has sent a message to the Man Utd bosses after dropping an ‘anxiety’-ridden star vs Crystal Palace following a social media put-down.",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Thomas Frank and Arne Slot are hot on his heels amid Spurs and Liverpool crises.",
      "Could Unai Emery replace Arne Slot at Liverpool? The Mailbox reckons the Dutchman needs to fix his side’s most ‘baffling’ problem to save himself…",
      "Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Man Utd signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs are having ‘doubts’ about head coach Ruben Amorim as they prepare to block an ‘elite’ January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings."

      "Manchester United are widely expected to target new wing-backs in the transfer market as Ruben Amorim has struggled to find a workable solution for either flank this season, and after giving a brutal assessment of Patrick Dorgu on the back of the Dane’s ill-advised use of social media this week, the Red Devils manager’s team selection for the clash with Crystal Palace suggests the 21-year-old could soon be out in the cold.",
      "Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing as Manchester United boss when he joined in a £25m move from Lecce in January. He struggled along with the rest of his teammates in his debut half-season and there are no real signs of improvement in the left wing-back this term, with recent performances leading him to be picked out as a weak link in the United side.",
      "In a withering assessment of his contributions ahead of the Palace game, Amorim said: “You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. When I see Patrick playing for the national team, he scored a great goal against Scotland and the decision that he made under pressure was completely different than the decision he’s making in our team. I think it’s the decision, he needs to be calmer playing the game.",
      "“I remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make when a guy from Scotland was there. I saw it when he played in Italy. But again, here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning. He has time to improve. I just need to understand the context in trying to help them (Dorgu and Dalot). They are far from their best, and they know it. Like a lot of players in our team, like myself. I just look at them, and think they have so much more to give. So let’s see this week if we can improve that.”",
      "Dalot, who’s also been far from his (mediocre) best takes Dorgu’s place on the left, with Amad Diallo dropping deeper in place of Noussair Mazraoui at right wing-back and Mason Mount coming into the starting lineup to occupy one of the inverted No.10 spots.",
      "Dorgu’s snub comes on the back of him failing to realise the media attention paid to social media posts slating the Manchester United manager, and more specifically the players’ responses to said posts.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Man Utd: Mainoo ‘says yes’ to transfer as Romano confirms ‘deal sealed’ for first 2026 signing\n👉 Man Utd ‘present offer’ to hijack Liverpool transfer with one club ‘leading race’ for one reason\n👉 Rashford to Barcelona roadblock prompts Arsenal interest; sees PSG ‘test’ Man Utd with £61m swap offer",
      "An Instagram post pointing out the flaws in Amorim’s management of the club which stated ‘Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together’ received a ‘like’ from Dorgu, or at least Dorgu’s profile this week.",
      "And while Amorim is yet to respond to his wing-back’s misguided social media actions, and frankly if he’s asked about it in a press conference or interview quite a large part of us will die inside, the pre-game comments he did make on Dorgu suggest United will look to bring in someone to play ahead of him as a priority.",
      "Asked why Mount and Dalot came into the starting lineup on Sunday, Amorim said: “It’s the way you train. They trained really well, the others too. Then the tactical aspect. Mason Mount is really smart, gives us more possession. He is intense, he can score goals so is one more player to be near the box.”",
      "Manchester United XI: Lammens, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Dalot, Mbeumo, Mount, Zirkzee.",

Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight, with Thomas Frank and Arne Slot hot on his heels.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",

Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, albeit after a very Iraola swing in form from Champions League qualification contenders to mid-tables after three defeats and no wins in four games as the summer centre-back exodus now looks to be hurting them.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Just when you think the Sword of Damocles has been lifted, they are abject in defeat at home against 10-man Everton.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, impressive victories over Sunderland and then Tottenham have restored trust in this as an imperfect but solid marriage.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. Another horribly limp first-half performance in defeat to Fulham adds to his woes. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and credit in defeat to Manchester City looks likely to only delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",

      "But at this point, the one thing that baffles me above all else is how we have completely forgotten how to defend and/or press and it’s looking increasingly likely that Slot is not sure how to fix this.",
      "His insistence on starting certain players, even when they have been poor and almost detrimental to our play is frustrating. How demotivating it must be for those on the bench to see such dismal performance and the gaffer continuing to pick them regardless.",
      "I don’t want Slot out. I still hope he can turn it around, but he needs to take some tough decisions or the mounting pressure with such heavy losses might just sound his death knell.\nAbhinav, Mumbai (YNWA)",

      "This week we saw an impressive team display by a team from Merseyside where they showed a clear collective desire to fight for the good of the team, working tirelessly in that regard whilst having a clear incisive plan about how to attack the opposition – it’s just a shame to me that the team in question wore blue ( .. a genuine congratulations to the toffees for a performance that they can be rightly proud of against Man Utd).",
      "Which leads me to the crux of this mail – where is the collective fight to overcome adversity within this Liverpool team that we are watching this season?",
      "I have always felt across my many decades of supporting Liverpool that the collective spirit/battling qualities are part of our DNA and therefore a given. Recent viewings appear to be bringing this into question.",
      "That is not to say that if we solve that particular aspect that everything else will just fall into place – it feels to me that there are many layers to our current malaise (layers may be the wrong term here … perhaps a tangled ball of wool is more apt).",
      "Let me briefly comment on one or two (but not all !) of those key aspects as I see it:",
      "From a squad balance perspective there appears to have been a questionable prioritisation of transfer funds across the summer that has led to a situation where we are too thin in defensive areas. I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "As another mailboxer recently penned, the definition of stupid is to do the same thing over and over again and to expect different results.",
      "He has to show the backbone to drop out of form players – Salah should be watching Chiesa run around on the pitch rather than the other way round (although Salah isn’t doing a great deal of running at the mo !). Drop Konate for Gomez in the short term.",
      "To make an omelette, first you have to break some eggs.",
      "Where is the youth pathway currently ? (Quansah and Elliott have been jettisoned .. Rio not getting hardly any minutes) – without the flow of talent up the line from the youth setup, future transfer windows become far more expensive.",
      "If he can’t solve this, then it feels to me that Liverpool’s next full-time manager will be a Spanish bloke whose surname starts with a vowel.",
      "If the club hierarchy cherish Alonso as they appeared to in the run up to Klopp departing, they may have the patience to wait to see how the current arrangement at Real Madrid plays out and see if there is a possibility at the end of the season (nothing immediate).",
      "Iraola really interests me and clearly has something about him – there is plausible potential for that to happen mid-season, unlike Alonso, so if Liverpool decide to let Slot go mid-season it will be very telling if they seek a temporary manager until the end of the season (which will indicate favouring Alonso) or whether they go all out to get a permanent replacement in.",

While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief. I am sure it plays a part in the situation but to write of the season seems a bit much for the ‘mentality monsters’ of LFC.\nHanKolo, Vietnam",

      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours.

I would slightly disagree with Ian Wright that it is solely racially motivated when black players are criticised. I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind).

      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100million for Elliot Anderson after Manchester City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Anderson has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League this season, leading the division in ball recoveries (98).",
      "He is also third for fouls won (25), fifth for passes completed (734), and third for progressive passes (100).",
      "Anderson’s form has been a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Forest.",
      "The City Ground club are already on their third manager of the campaign after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo with Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted eight games before being replaced by Sean Dyche.",
      "While Forest, who are 16th in the Premier League, have struggled, Anderson has been fantastic under all three managers.",
      "Unsurprisingly, his form has caught the attention of several top clubs.",
      "One of those clubs is Manchester City, who are seeking a long-term replacement for Rodri.",
      "Rodri has struggled to stay fit this season after missing the majority of 2024/25 with an ACL injury, and his deputy Nico Gonzalez has failed to impress so far.",
      "Gonzalez is definitely improving, and any midfielder is a downgrade on the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner, but Pep Guardiola will have expected more from the £50million January signing.",
      "Anderson is Premier League-proven and looks the real deal. Not only has he been terrific for Forest, but he has also established himself as a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s England starting XI.",
      "He’d be a top signing for City, and according to the Daily Mail, Guardiola’s side are ‘ready to make Anderson one of their top targets in 2026’ and are now ‘ahead of’ Manchester United in the race for his signature.",
      "City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and Guardiola are huge admirers of the 23-year-old and have sent scouts to watch him this season.",
      "It’s believed Forest ‘will reject any advances in January’ and think they can hold out for £100m after the World Cup. The minimum expectation is £80m for Anderson, who appeals to City because he can play as both a No.6 and No.8.",
      "Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has also been targeted by City, but they are now more interested in the Forest star.",
      "There is also interest from Liverpool and Manchester United, while £80-100m is deemed too much by his former club Newcastle United.",

      "The midfielder wasn’t pushing to leave but wanted regular football. When the opportunity to join Forest arose, he took it, and the Magpies were happy to oblige.",
      "His exit was regarded as nothing more than a PSR sham, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction in a separate deal worth ‘£20m’.",
      "Anderson’s transfer fee on paper was £35m, but it was effectively a £15m move when you accounted for the Odysseas deal.",
      "At the time, £35m looked laughable. Now he’s worth around triple that.",
      "Not only would Anderson be perfect for this disjointed Newcastle team, with Joelinton declining, Miley showing little progression, and Ramsey and Willock injury-prone, but they will be devastated to have let a £100m midfielder, who came through their academy, leave for £15m.",

      "That makes this one of the most difficult away assignments in the league. United, meanwhile, have just one away win all season.",
      "That contrast makes Palace to Win at 7/5 a straightforward starting point, especially with United losing 16 of their last 26 away trips to London clubs.",
      "Goals-based markets are tougher to call. Palace keep things tight, but United’s matches have been chaotic by expected-goals trends.",
      "Both teams to score feels like an unnecessary price given skinny odds of 4/7, while over 2.5 is just 7/10.",
      "Better than 2/1 on Daniel Munoz to score or assist stands out. He’s a one-in-three man, but United’s setup could allow him to trouble the center-backs.",
      "The fact that Jean-Philippe Mateta has gone four Palace games without a goal is ominous. He has three in six versus United, including a brace last season. Back him to score at 11/10."

      "It’s claimed Madrid and Alonso are concerned by his ‘loss of technical confidence and the constant ups and downs of performance’.",
      "Amorim is ‘confident his addition would give an immediate leap in quality’ as he sees Valverde as ‘the ideal steering wheel to support in midfield’.",
      "The report adds:",

      "United are ‘aware it won’t be an easy negotiation’ but are ‘willing to bet hard’ on the teenager and ‘there have already been preliminary contacts to assess the conditions’ of the transfer’.",

      "Paul Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Manchester United signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim looked to be turning things around at Old Trafford through a run of three wins and two draws, but the Red Devils returned to the doldrums with a poor performance in a 1-0 defeat to Everton on Monday.",

      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson are thought to be their top three targets and Scholes has made his “pick”.",
      "“But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he’s almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "“He’s done really well at Chelsea, don’t get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I’m not sure.",
      "“Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford’s a big pitch. It’s a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "“I’d say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don’t like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "“He’s come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I’d like to see all three of them.",
      "“I’d probably say I’d go Wharton. I still don’t think they’re any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they’re more the style of football these days.",
      "“I just think Wharton’s got a little bit more quality. That’s tough saying that. I think he’s got more quality than Baleba.",
      "“Baleba’s got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It’s close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I’d just pick Wharton.”",
      "The new midfield recruit looks set to push Kobbie Mainoo – who’s yet to start a Premier League game this season – further down the pecking order, and Scholes is frustrated by the England international’s lack of game time under Amorim.",
      "He added: “Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he’s not played. You could expect that.",
      "“One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team.",
      "“We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it’s not quite happened for him. The manager doesn’t seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "“But the manager’s just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that’s something he has to deal with.",
      "“I think he’s dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "“As I’m frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don’t have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "“He [Amorim] possibly doesn’t trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn’t the most physical, but he’s streetwise. He knows the position, he’s done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he’s got that experience.",
      "“Kobbie hasn’t quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he’s going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don’t do that.",
      "“They’ve got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he’s got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "“I think he’s clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn’t seem to think he’s the answer at the minute.”",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 97.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 69.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently looking over their shoulders in 20th and 22nd.",
      "Total points: 67.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Inter (UCL), Atalanta (UCL), Napoli (UCL), Juventus (UCL), Roma (UEL), Bologna (UEL), Fiorentina (UECL)",
      "",
      "Only having five teams but a couple of them being very decent means Portugal are prone to starting deceptively well here, with any wins your Sportings and Portos pick up being worth a chunky 0.4pts apiece. But will inevitably slide down the table, especially with Santa Clara failing to reach the Conference league stage and Benfica unlikely to make the knockouts in the Champions League.",
      "Total points: 47.000\nTotal teams: Five\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Sporting (UCL), Benfica (UCL), Porto (UEL), Braga (UEL)\nEliminated: Santa Clara (UECL)",
      "",
      "All four of Poland’s European representatives have wound up in the Conference, but the fact they’re all still standing and racking up points that only need to be divided by four means a strong early total.",
      "Total points: 37.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Rakow Częstochowa, Jagiellonia Bialystok, Lech Poznan, Legia Warsaw (all UECL)",

      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid for one of their best players who is reportedly not happy under manager Xabi Alonso, according to a report in the Spanish media, but TEAMtalk has analysed why he is very unlikely to move to Old Trafford.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a new midfielder in 2026. With Ruben Amorim’s side aiming to finish in the Premier League top four this season, signing a new player for the middle of the park is the utmost priority for the Red Devils.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest is Man Utd’s top midfield target in 2026.",
      "Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, Brighton and Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba and Wolves dynamo Joao Gomes also feature in the Red Devils’ wishlist.",
      "E-Noticies has now thrown another name into the mix, reporting that Man Utd want to sign Federico Valverde from Real Madrid.",
      "Man Utd are said to be ‘planning to submit an offer that would exceed €120million (£105.2m, $139m) for Valverde, who was described as a ‘machine in midfield’ and ‘one of the most dynamic and complete midfielders in world football’ in Breaking The Lines in July 2025.",
      "The report comes amid claims in another section of the Spanish media that the Uruguay international is not happy with Madrid manager Alonso.",

      "However, in fairness to E-Noticies, it has noted that Madrid have not made ‘a definitive decision’ on the future of Valverde and are ‘remaining cautious’",
      "While ‘there will be no drastic moves in January’, if Valverde gets back to his best by the end of the season, then Madrid will ‘close the door without hesitation’.",
      "This is not the first time in the Spanish media that rumours linking Valverde with Man Utd have emerged.",

      "Vinicius Junior has informed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that he is not of a mind to extend his Real Madrid contract beyond 2027 owing to his fraught relationship with manager Xabi Alonso.",
      "After shaking his head in disgust and muttering “always me, I’m leaving the team” after being substituted in the 72nd minute of El Clasico last month, his exit may in fact come sooner than that, with The Athletic revealing that tensions between Vinicius and Alonso ‘have only grown’ as the season’s gone on – ‘it is a topic of daily debate inside and outside the club.’",
      "The question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be The Man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case.",
      "The smart money would be on the mad money coming from Saudi Arabia, but what about his Premier League options? We’ve ranked the Big Six on their chance of signing him.",

      "“No, but look at our stadium,” Frank replies.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea",
      "A Brazilian front three at Stamford Bridge would be fun, but spending big on ready-made stars isn’t part of a Chelsea plan based largely upon resale value and the key difference between Vinicius, Joao Pedro and Estevao is the Blues pair’s outstanding work off the ball as well as on it.",
      "There’s also a very good and highly amusing possibility that the Blues hierarchy may deem Vinicius a bit too old for them. At 25 he would be the fifth-oldest player in the squad.",
      "Would be well worth it purely to see Vinicius’ reaction to teammate and compatriot Estevao winning the Ballon d’Or ahead of him.",

      "4) Manchester City",
      "“Vinicius is… wow,” was a Pep Guardiola press conference snippet that’s predictably been cited as evidence of the Manchester City manager’s interest in signing the Brazilian by some outlets.",
      "But it was midway through an answer on the excellence of Jeremy Doku and how “incredible” Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley endured a nightmare against him in the recent 3-0 City win over the Reds having coped very comfortably indeed with the problems posed by Vinicius a few days.",
      "Guardiola did say in that same press conference that Doku “will never be a top, top scorer” and City could really do with some goals from their forwards beyond Erling Haaland’s contribution that Vinicius would provide. It could happen under Guardiola, but strikes us as a far more post-Pep panic move from a state-owned football club looking to sell shirts as they suffer a legacy boss comedown.",
      "",
      "3) Liverpool",
      "It would very New Liverpool for Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards to look at their alarming issues in defence, their stunning dip in midfield dynamism and the general lack of cohesion in a squad on the back of signing £420m-worth of big-name talent and think the best fix to be signing a famously stroppy, high-maintenance winger to play on the left over someone to play on the opposite side to replace their in-situ stroppy, high-maintenance winger.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United",
      "Any teenager would think it mad that Vinicius Junior would even consider a move to Manchester United. Most of them won’t remember the last time they won the Premier League title in 2012 and will be relying on tales of their exasperating greatness from parents, grandparents or millennial friends and family in order to fathom why members of an Amazonic tribe are still wearing Nike AIG Cristiano Ronaldo No. 7 shirts.",
      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But we must never discount the nagging Manchester United need to occasionally prove to the world that they are indeed Manchester United and can still attract the very biggest names in football, even when they’re not what they need in any way and are actually quite likely to undo the slight and evidently brittle improvements they’ve made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) Arsenal",
      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third. They’re ready to ‘break the bank’ as ‘favourites’ to sign him.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori has looked very comfortable on that left side of defence for Arsenal and Declan Rice can always shift across and defend when necessary as an all-round midfield master.",
      "Leandro Trossard was given his dues in the form of people who haven’t given him his dues saying others haven’t given him his dues after his excellent performance against Tottenham, but let’s be absolutely clear, Arsenal are still very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "And with eyes on the Champions League either on top of the Premier League in 2026 or after it in 2027, it would be useful to have a guy who’s won it twice and scored in both of those finals.",
      "Thomas Frank picking a fight and wasting his time on those who are not ‘true Tottenham fans’ in the aftermath of the Fulham defeat was certainly a choice.",

      "While there’s been much-needed progress under Ruben Amorim, there are still some shortfalls. Casemiro’s resurgence in the midfield has been welcome, though he’s still not the most consistent performer, and he’s playing alongside Bruno Fernandes, who should be playing further up the field.",

      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",

      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",

      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",

      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and tips Liverpool and Arsenal both not to win on Super Sunday.",
      "Strip the names away, hide the crests and if this was Team A hosting Team B then Crystal Palace would be odds-on.",
      "Because every measurable facet of Palace's game carries more structure, coherence and repeatability than anything Manchester United are serving up right now. This is why the 13/10 on offer for a Palace home win is dripping in value.",
      "This isn't about history. It's about now. And right now, United play football that resembles a flickering lightbulb: occasionally bright but one bad moment away from plunging a room into darkness.",
      "Palace, under Oliver Glasner, are the opposite. They look like a team. A functioning one. A confident one. A side that knows how to create, how to control.",
      "You're getting a fantastic price here on a better-drilled side, the clearer identity, the team whose game has weight and repeatability, not a historical brand propped up by recreational money in the markets. Home win.",
      "The value doesn't live in the traditional markets here as Aston Villa are rightly dominating across the board - it's hiding where Wolves under Rob Edwards are on the improve and that's their set piece output. His teams work set plays meticulously.",
      "His Luton team ranked as the best team in the Championship from set piece goals scored and expected goals output in both spells in that league while his Forest Green side ranked second for expected goals from set pieces during their promotion from League Two.",
      "We've already seen signs in one game that Wolves are taking set pieces more seriously after creating 0.77 worth of expected goals from those scenarios in the defeat to Crystal Palace. Ladislav Krejci, who has had 10 shots in his last 10 games, was the main threat and first contact from corners last weekend. He looks a tasty bet at 12/1 with Sky Bet to score.",
      "If there's one thing betting teaches you, it's that bad beats are difficult to stomach no matter how long you've been in this game for. And last week's angle, Brentford on the double chance at Brighton - still lingers like a stubborn hangover. The logic was right, the bet looked to be cashing, right up until those football gods decided that Brentford would throw away a 1-0 lead with 10 minutes to go and Igor Thiago would miss a penalty with the final kick.",
      "But here we are again, staring at a very familiar setup. And, yes, I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct, who turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 34 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only two of 16 games otherwise. Forest played 26 per cent of passes long vs Liverpool last week and a similar approach puts them in a great spot of getting another result with the 10/11 on the draw no bet standing out.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has made nine fouls in his last five games. The imperious, sometimes untouchable defender has gone missing and been replaced by a far scruffier version that is making more mistakes and committing more fouls.",
      "It took 11 games for Van Dijk to reach five fouls at the start of last season - now it looks like he can make five in one game.",
      "That player who glided through matches without needing to lay a glove on anyone is suddenly hacking, grabbing and stepping into late challenges like a man trying to put out fires with a watering can. Playing next to Ibrahima Konate can do that to a player.",
      "His direct opponent Callum Wilson is clever at tempting defenders into awkward contact and picking up soft fouls. Go back two seasons ago and Wilson was drawing 1.6 fouls per 90 in the Premier League and has won five fouls in four starts under Nuno Espirito Santo, who seems to trust him now to be the focal point.",
      "The price of 11/2 with Sky Bet for Van Dijk to make at least two fouls is massive - best price of the season territory. Take the value before the market catches up.",
      "This game stinks of caution.",
      "Those anticipating that one of these teams are going to play \"statement-making football\" could end up disappointed as these games can turn into an exercise in risk management, especially when you consider the hectic schedule both teams are facing at the moment.",
      "Enzo Maresca and Mikel Arteta are cut from the same cloth when it comes to control and not taking unnecessary risks, especially Arteta in these types of games away from home. Last season, Arsenal won just once away in their eight games with top nine opposition, drawing five of those matches. They've been beaten at Anfield this season and came through in gritty fashion at Newcastle in a very nip-and-tuck encounter.",
      "Arteta plays these games like a draw is just fine in the grand scheme of things - and he's not wrong.",
      "Both teams know that a point keeps the narrative intact. Nothing is lost, everything remains possible. The stalemate, the bet no one wants to back, is the shrewdest way to approach the outright market with 21/10 on offer with Sky Bet."

      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad and The Football, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has come to the defence of Ruben Amorim's infamous system but highlights the key difference in his side.",
      "Glasner uses the same 3-4-2-1 formation as Amorim, yet Palace sit fifth in the Premier League heading into the weekend after an impressive start to their season.",
      "Meanwhile, following a dismal display and result against 10-man Everton, United have slumped to 10th in the league having gone three games without a victory, with Gary Neville among the critics over Amorim's approach.",
      "Palace welcome Amorim's side to Selhurst Park on Sunday, having beaten United on three of the last four occasions. It's a run against United that included a 2-0 win at Old Trafford last season when a Jean-Philippe Mateta brace sunk Amorim's side.",
      "Despite United's poor recent form and a staunch critique of Amorim's formation, Glasner has pointed to the underlying numbers to defend the United boss.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Palace also rank among the top clubs for expected goals this season, however, Glasner suggests his deployment of the 3-4-3 formation allows his side to defend better, with the Eagles second only to Arsenal with the fewest goals conceded.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner added.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a very good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"So it's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are. I'm really looking forward to the game.\"",
      "While the formation is the same, Amorim believes the two interpretations are different. United's Portuguese boss admitted that Palace are better at performing their system.",
      "\"We play in a different way,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Asked if he is inspired by Glasner, Amorim added: \"I played against him in Frankfurt with Sporting, so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I take two weeks for an international break, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration I can.",
      "\"I have six years as a professional manager, so I am always trying to learn.\"",
