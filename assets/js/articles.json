      "Two titans of European football will come together in support of the MU Foundation, with a team of Manchester United legends set to take on their Celtic counterparts",
      "A team of Manchester United legends will stare down a side of Celtic icons at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Bryan Robson and Andy Cole have assembled a keen group of United superstars from down the years, with all proceeds going to the Manchester United Foundation. Meanwhile, Paul Lambert will call up a group of Bhoys icons to take on the challenge at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and Dimitar Berbatov are just a few of the Old Trafford icons set to line up for the home side. However, a talented bunch have agreed to suit up for the charity clash, which will be available to watch on TV and via live stream.",
      "Both clubs will be aiming to raise big sums, with the proceeds dedicated to helping young people across Manchester and further afield. Mirror Football provides all the need-to-know information ahead of Saturday's showdown, offering a welcome distraction to club football fans during the international break.",
      "In addition to the aforementioned United trio of the not-too-distant past, Robson and Cole will also have the likes of Antonio Valencia, Danny Simpson, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Mikael Silvestre at their disposal. Celtic are yet to confirm a full list of players, per se, though Charlie Mulgrew, Stiliyan Petrov, Barry Robson and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink are in line to feature.",
      "Other Hoops icons like Georgios Samaras, Emilio Izaguirre, Artur Boruc, Jonny Hayes, Efe Ambrose, Stephen McManus, Joe Ledley, Mikael Lustig, Gary Hooper, Darren O’Dea, Simon Donnelly, Kelvin Wilson and Lukasz Zaluska are also believed to be in action. And former Aston Villa midfielder Petrov spoke of what the occasion means to him and his team-mates.",
      "“I look forward to playing in these games and to see all those players again,\" he said prior to Saturday's showdown. \"Not many of us see each other because everybody lives in different parts of the world, different places. So it’s a great pleasure to meet up again, share old stories, have a good laugh and enjoy a beer.",
      "“I think both sets of fans will be expecting to win. Obviously Celtic now have a team that is a bit younger which is good. And you see that with the Dortmund game, it was very competitive, so I expect the same against Manchester United.”",

      "The Manchester City star was included in Lee Carsley’s first Three Lions selection for upcoming Nations League clashes with the Republic of Ireland and Finland. Grealish’s inclusion signalled his first return to the England set-up since being left out of Gareth Southgate’s Euros squad.",
      "And he is expected to start on Saturday, ironically against the side he turned away from before declaring for England. Shearer believes that if Grealish can hit top form during the current break, he could secure a Three Lions role for himself ahead of his left-wing rivals.",
      "Shearer said: \" Jack Grealish was named in the squad after saying himself that he was hugely disappointed not to be involved in the Euros. We know it was a bitter disappointment for him.",
      "\"For him to be named in the next squad, I think that tells you what Lee Carsley thinks of him and the belief he’s got in him. That should be a great confidence booster for Jack to think, ‘okay, this might be my time to step forward and take that left wing position’, when the likes of [Marcus] Rashford, [Raheem] Sterling and [Jadon] Sancho are all missing from the squad.\"",
      "Grealish could be in for a somewhat unwelcome reception should he start in Dublin given his previous defection. His former teammate Callum Robinson is expecting boos during Saturday’s clash.",
      "But Carsley has no concerns about throwing him straight in. Asked if he is worried about the reception he and Declan Rice could receive, he replied: “No, not at all.",
      "“We spoke not only about Jack and Declan, but to the whole squad, we spoke about the atmosphere, we expect it to be exciting, passionate and loud. But it will be no different to what the players are used to in Premier League games or high-level games, so I think they will be ready for whatever comes out.”",
      "Grealish, 28, has made 36 appearances during his England career but has scored just twice. His most recent appearance came in March this year in a 3-0 win against Bosnia & Herzegovina. The Manchester City man has not scored for the Three Lions since the opening match of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - a 6-2 thumping of Iran.",

      "It was announced back in February that Tuchel, 51, would leave his role as Bayern Munich head coach at the end of the 2023/24 campaign and he was subsequently touted for a number of high-profile roles.",
      "Manchester United were one of said roles given the pressure Erik ten Hag was under towards the end of last season. And although Tuchel is known to have met with United chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, he remains unattached.",
      "Ten Hag was handed a contract extension off the back of an impressive triumph over Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final, but the Dutchman is already under siege following an underwhelming start to the current campaign.",

      "Teddy Sheringham played with Roy Keane at Nottingham Forest and noticed a massive change in the Irishman after his Manchester United move.",
      "Midfield brute-turned pundit Keane arrived at Old Trafford in 1993 for a then- British transfer record of £3.75million after spending three years in the east Midlands, and enjoyed a vastly successful 12 years with the Red Devils - winning the Premier League seven times and a Champions League to boot.",
      "The pair of Keane and Sheringham reunited in Manchester four years later under Sir Alex Ferguson, where the Englishman added to an already eye-wateringly talented side featuring David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Andy Cole.",
      "However, Sheringham saw a change in Keane when the two took the pitch in a different shade of red for the first time, as the once attack-minded midfielder had been crafted into a defensive general.",
      "\"I knew Roy from my time at Nottingham Forest, before we became team-mates at Man United later on down the line,\" Sheringham began, speaking at the launch of Ladbrokes' Gaffer of all Accas.",
      "\"There was definitely a change in him as a player, without a doubt. When I was at Forest, he'd only just broken into the first-team when I arrived there, and he was an absolutely phenomenal, up and down, central midfielder. I played up-front with Cloughie [Nigel Clough] and so there wasn't a lot of pace up there at all. So, every time the ball came up to me or Nigel, he'd be running beyond us.",
      "\"He was such a different player, by the time I got to Man United. He was a sitting midfielder who controlled the game, he didn't go forward half as much as what he used to. Whether he was told to do that, or whether his game had just changed, I don't know.",
      "\"But at Forest, every time the ball came up to me, he'd be running beyond me, whereas at United, that just didn't happen. Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] had probably had a chat with him, or maybe he'd worked his own game out himself, and he just thought he'd end up running himself into the ground if he didn't change his game. But he was a phenomenal youngster, and changed his game perfectly.\"",
      "Keane retired in 2006 after a brief spell with Celtic, during which he won a league and cup double. Shortly after hanging up his boots, he took up a managerial role at Sunderland and guided them to promotion in his first year in charge. He moved to manage Ipswich Town in 2009 before assistant spells - his latest role with former club Forest in 2019.",
      "Having turned most of his attention to punditry, appearing on Sky Sports and ITV, Keane looks to have put coaching behind him. Sheringham hopes there may be at least one more coaching job left in him, although he isn't confident of seeing it materialise.",
      "\"I do think there's another job out there in management for Roy Keane,\" Sheringham continued. \"I'd have actually liked to have seen him in charge at Man United at some stage; I think he just has that aura about him. I don't think you're going to get him out of the position he's in now, though; I think he's found a lovely little niche for himself, what he's doing with Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher.",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if he went into management now, especially with his track record of reacting to things when they're not going his way, as a manager. He could very easily be in a job and out of it again in six months, and find himself with nothing. I'd have loved to have seen him in charge of Man United, but I don't think that's going to happen now.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes failed to make much of an impact during Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Liverpool last week, but Roy Keane reckons the Portugal international has earned a let off",
      "Roy Keane has leapt to the defence of Bruno Fernandes after his poor performance against Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United have made an awful start to the new campaign, having lost two of their opening three Premier League matches. A 3-0 hammering at the hands of rivals Liverpool left a sour taste in the mouth heading into the international break, and Keane says he wasn't happy with how many mistakes his former side made during the game.",
      "Speaking about the game on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast, the former Red Devils skipper, 53, questioned United's tactical incoherence while accusing key players of failing to \"turn up\". \"Bruno never turned up - [but] Bruno's entitled to have a quiet game,\" the Irishman said.",
      "Earlier, Jamie Carragher had criticised United's sloppiness on the ball, which as a result made them a little unstable in midfield. In response, Keane insisted that it was the defenders' jobs to provide stability, and that if errors are made by the midfielders, the players behind them should be stepping in to put the fire out.",
      "\"When you make mistakes you hope your defenders cover you, or your goalkeeper,\" he said. \"United are not really a settled team because there are still players coming to the club, and that's not an excuse, [but] when you're not at it you make mistakes.\"",
      "Gary Neville then asked Keane whether he thought United needed to get better at playing the ball out from the back, or whether it was worth ditching the philosophy. \"A little bit of both,\" he replied. \"You're not expecting United to go long, but with United there's still an element of [mimics a player hesitating and grimacing on the ball], they don't look as if there's a flow to them.\"",
      "United's playing style has been heavily scrutinised in recent months, with critics often slamming Ten Hag for failing to establish a discernible system for his team. Performances were poor throughout last season, and although blushes were partially spared by a surprise FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City in May, the campaign has gone down as one of the most disappointing in the club's history.",
      "After picking up just three points from a possible nine so far, United's 2024/25 season is threatening to go the way of the preceding campaign. Up next for Ten Hag's men is a trip to Southampton before an EFL Cup clash with League One club Barnsley, with both games arguably in the must-win bracket.",
      "Fernandes, meanwhile, has been something of a shining light in an otherwise gloomy period for the Manchester club. The 29-year-old has scored 79 goals in 237 matches and has been crowned the club's Player of the Year award three times in five-and-a-half seasons. His form in big games has, however, come under scrutiny in the past.",

      "If Steve McClaren has started as he means to go on as Jamaica manager, it's already clear fans have a very entertaining chapter in the football icon's tale awaiting them",
      "All it took was one training session for Steve McClaren to yield precisely what fans wanted of him as Jamaica manager.",
      "The Yorkshireman has taken over the Reggae Boyz in what promises to be one of the more peculiar portions of an illustrious football career. But his time in the Caribbean is already proving to be the gift we hope never stops giving. The same man who gave football one of its most memorable memes while in charge of Dutch club FC Twente is back at it again. And this time, he's speaking Patois.",
      "That's after the Jamaican FA published footage from the aftermath of ex-England manager McClaren's first training session in charge of the team. There, he can be seen engaging in an awkward half-thumb-up, half-fist-bump in an interview with the Reggae Boyz YouTube channel, who encouraged him to try Patois.",
      "\"You said something else this morning? No, something else,\" said the ex-Manchester United assistant with a pained expression across his face, struggling to recall the piece of slang. \"It was something. . .\"",
      "The unknown individual thought he was referring to the phrases \"big up\" or \"full active.\" But only when McClaren hears the greeting \"seal it up\" - which is sealed with a flick of each other's thumbs - does he jump into life.",
      "\"That's what he said!\" exclaimed McClaren in delight at his discovery. \"Look me in the eye. . .seal it up.\"",
      "The cap-touting coach appeared lost but then was found thanks to a little help from his new colleague. And online spectators couldn't get enough of the crossover fans never knew they needed all this time.",
      "\"Was like he’s lived there all his life,\" wrote one admirer in response to the video. Others couldn't help but lap up McClaren throwing himself into the job, with another lauding: \"Yes Steve, seal it up!!",
      "\"He's like a chameleon, blends into any environment,\" said another sarcastic viewer, this time linking footage of McClaren's infamous Dutch accent while coaching in the Eredivisie. Thankfully, the 63-year-old is yet to throw himself quite so committedly into the role while managing Jamaica - but there's still time.",
      "Having only taken his first training session with the team on Tuesday, McClaren will soon be baptised in the role when the Reggae Boyz host Cuba in a CONCACAF Nations League clash on Friday.",
      "Speaking after his much-anticipated arrival at the helm, McClaren said: \"From the first day [of the training camp] the players came in, it's been great energy and spirit amongst them. They've shown that on the training field.",
      "\"We can control the controllable, which we've tried to do. We just have keep things simple. I'm going to concentrate on the performance - if we get the performance from the players, normally you get the win.\"",
      "Performances will ultimately dictate just how long McClaren lasts after taking his first senior management role since 2019. However, it already appears as though vibes are a guarantee.",

      "Angel Gomes has been handed a first England call-up, with those who watched him go through the ranks at Man Utd not surprised he has made it to the full squad",
      "For those who watched Angel Gomes progress through the youth ranks at Manchester United, he was always destined to reach the top.",
      "He may have been slight in stature and build, but his natural talent, allied to a steely focus, marked him out as a youngster who had the ability to play at the highest level.",
      "Gomes may have been forced to leave his boyhood club United in 2020 when his contract expired, but his talent and work ethic have led to a deserved first full England call-up.",
      "Having played for every England age group since Under-16s – and captained the Three Lions to victory in the Under-17 World Cup in 2017 – the call-up is vindication for his relentless graft.",
      "Now a regular starter at Lille, Gomes has emerged as a midfielder of stature, his progress having alerted a host of Europe's top clubs, with his contract expiring at the end of this season.",
      "The fact he is in demand is no surprise to Paul McGuinness, former academy manager and Under-18s coach at United, who watched Gomes progress since he arrived at the club aged just six.",
      "In nearly a quarter of a century at United, McGuinness helped oversee the development of more than 90 players who went on to play in the first-team, 23 of which became full internationals.",
      "With Gomes set to earn his first England cap, that figure is set to rise to 24, with McGuinness claiming the call-up is a reward for the 24-year-old's dedication to maximising his talent.",
      "“He stood out when he was in the academy because he was smaller than everybody else,” said McGuinness, son of former United player and manager, Wilf.",
      "“But he was brilliant technically on the ball and had a real love for football. He had a huge natural talent and what we did was always encourage those skilful talents.",
      "“One of our mottos was 'skill is king', so Angel was always in a place where he was going to thrive and we were playing the type of football that would suit him. It's a great testament to him, his coaches at United right through to his coaches with England, that someone who was so small has been recognised repeatedly.",
      "“He represented every age group with England, captained the team that won the Under-17 World Cup and has performed well for the Under-21s. That's why Lee Carsley has brought him into the full squad and the benefit of having stability in your coaching set-up and system - people see these young players over the years.",
      "“But if you get a new manager in, like they've had at United quite a few times, they don't know them as well. But with England, they've seen Angel all the way through and trusted his talent. Lee has seen him close-up in a tournament for the Under-21s, for four or five weeks, so in that sense he must have great belief in him.",
      "“That's a plus of having someone who's been through the system [as England boss]. If you'd just plucked some top manager from out there, he would never have picked Angel, because he wouldn't have a clue. So to have that continuity – in terms of managers and coaches – in the international system is a real strength.”",
      "Gomes was handed his United debut in May 2017 by Jose Mourinho. At 16 years and 263 days old, he was the youngest player to make his United debut since Busby Babe Duncan Edwards in 1953. McGuinness added: “Angel has always had great belief in his ability. He had no problem moving up age groups. He'd be 12 or 13, playing against the Under-18s and he just got better and better.”",

      "Zidane has been without a job since leaving Real Madrid for the second time in May 2021. The 52-year-old Frenchman has been linked with several roles in the past three years, including United, Bayern Munich and the national team jobs at United States, Brazil and Algeria, but is still biding his time.",
      "He sparked rumours that he could be preparing for a return to the dugout this week when he was spotted attending a training session at Real Betis. It comes amid pressure on Erik ten Hag at United following a poor start to the season, just months after the club’s new leadership team openly courted other managers.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter and Gareth Southgate were among those considered by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his advisors, while L’Equipe stated that Zidane was also interested in taking over from Ten Hag. In the end, Ten Hag was given a stay of execution, but the Dutchman remains on shaky ground after the 3-0 thrashing by Liverpool at Old Trafford.",
      "At the premiere of a film about his former Juventus manager Marcelo Lippi in February, Zidane was asked if he would return to coaching. He replied: \"Why not, anything can happen. Now I’m doing other things, but we'll see. I'd certainly like to return to the bench.\"",
      "Zidane has only ever managed at Real Madrid so far in his coaching career, but was incredibly successful over his two spells at the club. The former midfielder won two La Liga titles and three Champions League titles before walking away at the end of the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "He has taken an unusually long time out since then, but his ethos is clear: he will only return for the right opportunity. \"Never say never,\" Zidane told L’Equipe in 2022. \"Especially when you are a coach today. If I go back to a club, it is to win. I say this with all modesty. That's why I can't just go anywhere.",
      "\"For other reasons, too. Certain conditions make things more difficult. When someone says to me, 'Do you want to go to Manchester [United]?' I understand English but I don't fully master it.",

Of course, I might not always win, but I know that you need to have this, this and this. And I want to do everything on my side to optimise my chances of victory.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho left Manchester United on loan for the second time this year to join Chelsea on Transfer Deadline Day, and former Blues midfielder Emmanuel Petit has been left baffled by the decision",
      "Emmanuel Petit is completely confused by Jadon Sancho's decision to join Chelsea on Deadline Day and questioned the player's motivation.",
      "Sancho left Manchester United on loan for the second time after growing frustrated with Erik ten Hag. After a stint back at Borussia Dortmund in the second half of last season, he opted for a return to his native London.",
      "However, ex-Chelsea midfielder Petit is baffled as to why Sancho would choose to join an already packed Blues squad, given the intense competition for places. The Frenchman even joked about the lack of space in Chelsea's dressing room after their busy summer influx.",
      "\"When I saw they had signed Jadon Sancho on Deadline Day, I wondered if there was even any shirt numbers left for him,\" he told sports betting site BetVictor (via football.london). \"Imagine him opening the door to the dressing room and seeing so many players they don't all fit in the same dressing room! At the training ground they must have two dressing rooms, three pitches and 12 physios.",
      "“The club are not the only ones responsible for the situation. It also comes down to the players. How can Sancho bring himself to sign for Chelsea after what happened at Manchester United? He was loaned to Borussia Dortmund, then went back to United, and now he’s off to Chelsea who have 40 or so players and he is just one of them.\"",
      "The former France international didn't hold back in slamming the move, arguing it could be a money-driven decision for Sancho, who is set to struggle for guaranteed playing time once again. Petit continued: \"Hasn't he had enough of moving around clubs, losing his way on the pitch and losing his confidence? Now he's at a club that has no consistency, lacking in confidence and results. If he's not there for the money, what is he there for?\"",
      "This isn't the first time voices have been raised concerning Chelsea's controversial transfer market strategy. The dazzling summer spree overseen by Enzo Maresca has looked hectic, marked by the arrival of 11 new first-team players setting up shop in Stamford Bridge.",
      "Before Sancho entered the scene, the Blues had already thrown £100million at the acquisitions of Pedro Neto and Joao Felix. That's taking into account the club had an already robust wing selection, including talents like Cole Palmer, Christopher Nkunku, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke and Carney Chukwuemeka.",
      "The new football season is upon us and with 500 live games to watch, as well access to Cricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL and the NBA across eight dedicated channels, Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action.",
      "\"I'd probably say Frank Lampard,\" the winger told talkSPORT in 2021 when asked to name his England idol. \"I was a Chelsea fan growing up, I can't lie! Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard were my favourite players at the time.",
      "\"I just love Frank Lampard and how he played his game; he was so direct and so composed on the ball. I like things like that.\"",
      "Those comments suggest the Camberwell native's affection for all things Chelsea run way deeper than Petit might expect. Sancho's next task is clear as he seeks to win over new coach Maresca, disprove critics like Petit, and show his dedication extends far beyond any financial incentives.",

      "United's sporting director Dan Ashworth claimed it was the depth in their attack which meant they green lighted Sancho's exit. The club have numerous options and Ten Hag had overlooked Sancho for both matchday squads this season - highlighting the limited game time he was set to get.",
      "Ashworth told Sky Sports : \"I think with any player, whether it’s Jadon, whether it’s Scott [McTominay] or whether it’s Aaron [Wan-Bissaka], if there’s a preference that they would like to move and go to a new club and it’s right for them and it’s right for us, then you have to explore it.",
      "\"We felt we had enough depth in that particular position to be able to cover it, we’ve got four really good wide players, Jadon was a fifth, and it just enabled us to make that decision. If it was good for him and good for us it was something we were willing to consider.\"",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer business might not be completely finished, with clubs from a select number of leagues still able to make new signings in September",
      "Despite losing two of their first three Premier League matches, Manchester United have reasons to be optimistic about their summer transfer business.",
      "Manuel Ugarte joined from Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day, joining Sekou Kone in completing a late switch. The late double swoop followed earlier moves for Joshua Zirzkee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "United also offloaded plenty of players, some for fees and others when their contracts expired. Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial were in the latter camp, with Donny van de Beek and Aaron Wan-Bissaka among those in the former.",
      "There might be more business to take care of before the window shuts for teams in other leagues, though. That's one of the areas in focus as Mirror Football brings you the latest from around Old Trafford.",
      "Clubs in the Turkish Super Lig have until September 13 to make final additions to their squads, prompting links with out-of-favour Premier League stars. One such player is United midfielder Casemiro, who endured a tough time against Liverpool in the last league game.",
      "The Brazilian has dropped further down the pecking order following Ugarte's August arrival, and United could end up cutting their losses on the £60m signing from Real Madrid. Galatasaray are thought to be keen, with The Times indicating he remains on their radar.",
      "Galatasaray have cleared space in their squad, with Portugal international Sergio Oliveira leaving for Olympiacos. However, United's decision to include Casemiro in their Europa League squad suggests an exit might not be entirely straighforward.",
      "Antony is another United star attracting interest from Turkey. However, despite reported efforts from Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce, the winger is thought to have no plans to leave Old Trafford.",
      "“I see reports about a potential exit on loan. Antony’s plan is clear: Manchester United,\" the former Ajax star's agent Junior Pedroso said earlier this year. \"He wants to stay, he’s only focused on Man United. We already spoke about that with the club.”",
      "Mirror Football understands Antony wants to stay at United and prove himself, despite seeing opportunities limited of late. He hasn't started a competitive game for his club since the 4-0 defeat at Crystal Palace in early May, and has played just one minute of football this season.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has outlined the role played by Erik ten Hag in convincing him to join Manchester United. The Dutch defender has been reunited with his former Ajax boss after joining United from Bayern Munich, and made his first Premier League start in Sunday's defeat against Liverpool.",
      "\"Yeah obviously [he was] a really important part because he knows me really well, I know him really well,\" De Ligt told club media. \"He made me captain also at Ajax. Also at my time at Ajax he gave me a lot of confidence, he gave me a lot of motivation to try to lead the team.\"",
      "De Ligt will return to club duties after joining up with the Netherlands squad for the September international break. Ronald Koeman's side have a UEFA Nations League double-header, playing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Germany.",

      "Trent Alexander-Arnold could be seen grinning from ear to ear as he entered Old Trafford before Liverpool's 3-0 demolition of Manchester United.",
      "Arne Slot's side were a class above their rivals down the M62 last Sunday. Alexander-Arnold had a goal ruled out before a Luis Diaz brace put them two to the good before half-time.",
      "Both of those goals came about after Casemiro had lost possession in his own half, with Erik ten Hag hauling him off at the break. But it was more of the same after the restart.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was dispossessed before Salah, who'd set up Diaz's efforts, was slipped in by Dominik Szoboszlai to finish first time past Andre Onana. There could've been more for the visitors, who saw out the game comfortably thereafter.",
      "And Liverpool fans reckon Alexander-Arnold was assured they'd be leaving with three points well before kick-off after seeing him getting off the team bus upon their arrival. As seen on the club's YouTube channel, the right-back was booed by the United fans who were watching on from behind a barrier.",
      "In response, he simply beamed back at them as he swaggered into the ground. Taking to the comments, one viewer argued: \"Trent knows we're going to win when he gets off from the bus.\"",
      "\"Trent already laughing from the entrance... knowing they gonna cook United,\" echoed a second, with a third joking: \"That Trent smile when they booed him while he was entering.... he knew what kind of spanking was coming.\"",
      "A fourth reacted: \"Trent's smile while getting booed walking from the bus. He knew what was coming.\" And a fifth wrote: \"Love the way Trent was laughing at their fans on the way in Old Trafford and on the way out.\"",
      "Alexander-Arnold was also seen giving some back to the Red Devils faithful when departing Old Trafford post-match. Just like he'd done on the pitch to the away end after full-time, he held up three fingers to remind them of the scoreline.",
      "He wasn't wholly happy, though, having been substituted in the second half for the third time out of three under Slot. His frustration was clear to see as he made his way off the pitch for Conor Bradley with a little under 15 minutes to play, with his contract notably expiring next summer.",

      "The Premier League's transfer window has been shut for almost a week, while the possibility of a move to the Saudi Pro League has also diminished. Nevertheless the possibility of a move to Turkey has been touted.",
      "Galatasaray have been linked with completing a deal for the 32-year-old former Real Madrid star with deals to the Super Lig possible for another eight days. Okan Buruk's side have already taken advantage of their extended period available to land Victor Osimhen on loan, and have shortlisted Casemiro as they look to strengthen in midfield.",
      "It is unlikely however, that the Turkish side could match his £375,000-per-week that sees him as United's top-earner. And the Brazilian, who has been left out of his national squad for fixtures against Ecuador and Paraguay, has little interest in leaving Old Trafford.",
      "Instead, Casemiro is looking to return to the heights he found in his first season at the club, and being hauled off after 45 minutes against Liverpool has not inspired him to move elsewhere, per the Mail. The five-times Champions League winner was a target of criticism from Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher once again, months on from being urged to 'call it a day' by the former Liverpool defender.",

      "Liverpool knew as long ago as January that they would need a new manager this summer. They ended up appointing Arne Slot, but only after links with the likes of Xabi Alonso and Ruben Amorim ended up going nowhere.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen manager Alonso and Sporting boss Amorim both stayed put, as did United manager Erik ten Hag. A change in the dugout at Old Trafford was considered, with at least one candidate sounded out, but ultimately the club's higher-ups kept the faith.",
      "Ten Hag and Slot faced off in the final Premier League game before the international break, with Liverpool's new man coming out on top. However, Neville and Carragher found themselves arguing over the matter of first-choice managers for the two clubs.",
      "\"I think there was some sentiment after the final. The fans wanted Ten Hag to be kept on and backed,\" Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast",
      "\"They have seen enough managers sacked over the years. I think they sounded out Graham Potter, Gareth Southgate, Roberto De Zerbi and Thomas Tuchel around that time. But there was a bit of a negative reaction from fans.",
      "\"There is no doubt they were having a flirt around the market and seeing what they could do. I think if there was an unbelievable manager that could improve United 100 percent, beyond what Ten Hag could, they would have made a change. Liverpool had six months to replace Jurgen Klopp and still found it challenging to get their top targets.\"",
      "\"Where are you getting it from that Arne Slot wasn't Liverpool's top target?\" Carragher asked in response, only to be reminded by Neville of his own claims that the Merseyside club would \"definitely\" go after their former midfielder Alonso.",
      "\"That is my opinion!\" Carragher replied. \"I am sure they did ask about Alonso and were told straight away that he was staying at Bayer Leverkusen. You’re saying Liverpool had this big search…how do we know exactly what went on behind the scenes at Liverpool? Why didn’t Man United employ Arne Slot then?”",
      "Neville suggested United would have considered Slot, who was linked with other Premier League jobs during his time at Feyenoord. “I think they’d have looked at him, but thought can we really get rid of a guy [in Ten Hag] who has won two trophies in two years, who hasn’t been backed by the proper structure, to bring another Dutch manager in?\" he asked.",
      "Carragher was having none of it, though. \"What do you mean without a proper structure?!\" he said. \"He’s gone out and brought in everyone he wanted!\"",
      "Speaking during NOS' coverage of Euro 2024, Ten Hag confirmed United were considering Tuchel \"Manchester United have told me that they spoke with Tuchel, but they eventually came to the conclusion that they already have the best manager,\" he said in June.",
      "Weeks later, he agreed a contract extension with the club until 2026. “In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together,\" Ten Hag said when the deal was confirmed.",

Sporting director Dan Ashworth is among the high-profile backroom hires, and the former FA director of elite development has reportedly played a significant part in the latest hire.",

Erith also had a two-year stint with the FA in a sports science role before joining Spurs, returning to the governing body as a consultant performance coach for just over a year from March 2016.",

      "Manchester United have included Casemiro in their squad for the upcoming Europa League campaign despite the midfielder being linked with a move away.",
      "Casemiro's future had been up in the air since United completed their deadline day move for Manuel Ugarte, with links to the Turkish Super Lig emerging. Clubs in Turkey have until September 13 to make new signings, less than a fortnight before United begin their Europa League campaign against Erik ten Hag's former club Twente.",

      "United have named a 25-man squad for the competition, which can be supplemented by a 'B' list of academy players including the likes of recent debutant Toby Collyer. However, Amass - who came through Watford's academy - needed to be registered in the main squad.",
      "\"A player may be registered on List B if he is born on or after 1 January 2003 and has, since his 15th birthday, been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years, or a total of three consecutive years with a maximum of one loan period to a club from the same association for a period not longer than one year,\" UEFA's rules read.",
      "\"Players aged 16 may be registered on List B if they have been registered with the participating club for the previous two years without interruption.\"",

      "Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson faced the prospect of having to delve into his own wallet to pay off star winger Cristiano Ronaldo in a light-hearted bet that got a little serious",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo once cost Sir Alex Ferguson £400 after the Manchester United boss bet the then-young winger that he wouldn't score 15 goals over one season.",
      "In the 2005/06 Premier League season, Ronaldo had managed to score nine goals in 33 appearances, and also notched up seven assists across the campaign. However, legendary tactician Sir Alex put across a challenge that the Portuguese wonderkid couldn't refuse – score 15 and win £400.",
      "By December 2006, a 21-year-old Ronaldo had already scored 13 goals – including three successive braces against Aston Villa, Wigan and Reading.",
      "After his brace against Villa, Ronaldo told reporters that his main ambition in the league this season was to score more and \"beat\" Ferguson. He revealed: \"To beat the manager is my ambition and I want to carry on. I want to score more goals.\"",
      "A goal and assist followed in United's game against Watford that they won 4-0. Then, he reached the all-important 15-goal mark with another 4-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring from the spot to secure his £400 payday.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports interviewer Geoff Shreeves after the match, Ferguson jokingly said: \"Penalties don't count. Oh well, I'll need to go the bank.\"",
      "The legendary Scotsman went on to praise Ronaldo's tenacity to be involved in every phase of the game, his natural skill and goalscoring ability that landed him a nice little three-figure sum.",
      "\"It's fantastic, the boy has come on great, he's got the courage to want the ball,\" Ferguson said at the time, although he made sure to share some criticism to help keep Ronaldo grounded. \"I thought he played in the early parts of the match he was careless but once he got more of the ball and I think he improved because he had more of the ball.",
      "\"I think he's that type of player where you have to service him and get the ball to him and get him working in the game. He's not the player who plays in the fringes, he's a player who has to be involved all the time.\"",
      "Ronaldo went on to score 23 goals in 53 appearances for United in that season, assisting 14 times and winning the 2006/07 Premier League title with the Red Devils by a six-point margin over second-placed Chelsea.",
      "With his 17 goals in the Premier League, Ronaldo was third in the overall top goalscorer record for the season, with Didier Drogba taking home the Golden Boot with 20 goals. Blackburn Rovers' Benni McCarthy was second with 18 goals, and Wayne Rooney tied for fourth with Charlton Athletic's Mark Viduka on 14 goals.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Ronaldo's goalscoring only improved from then on, with the Portuguese star scoring a whopping 42 goals in all competitions for United in the 2007/08 season in just 49 appearances.",
      "He then left United just one season later to join Real Madrid, scoring an incredible 450 goals in nine seasons for the La Liga outfit. The Portuguese icon's total goal tally comes to an unbelievable 763 goals in 1,017 professional appearances, including 240 assists.",
      "With Ronaldo now playing his competitive football out in Saudi Arabia for Al Nassr, the 39-year-old doesn't show any signs of retiring from the sport any time soon.",

      "There is currently a buzz within Manchester United about youngster Toby Collyer.",
      "The casual observer might think Collyer didn't pull up trees in academy games, but he's been considered a leading prospect at Carrington since he signed from Brighton in 2022.",
      "A source said this summer that Erik ten Hag 'really likes' Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Collyer has gone under the radar in the last two years but that's beginning to change. The midfielder made his Premier League debut in dramatic circumstances last weekend when replacing Casemiro at half-time and there should be more top-flight appearances to come.",
      "Liverpool hammered United 3-0 and Collyer won't look back on his league debut with fondness, but he won three tackles, made three recoveries, won seven duels and completed all of his attempted dribbles, which meant he could be happy with his individual performance.",
      "Collyer enjoyed a promising summer and there have been signs along the way that he can earn a prominent first-team role. He was named as a substitute eight times last season and Ten Hag was spotted in conversation with the 20-year-old after the FA Cup final.",
      "Although Collyer didn't make the squad for the FA Cup final, he travelled to Wembley and was on the pitch at the final whistle. Ten Hag exchanged words with him and the moment was reminiscent of his conversation with Kobbie Mainoo after the Carabao Cup final in 2023.",
      "In the following campaign, Mainoo enjoyed his breakout season and it felt significant that Ten Hag took the time to speak to Collyer, who was given a new contract weeks later.",
      "Collyer was rewarded with a new deal in July that extended his stay until 2027 and Ten Hag insisted on attending his contract signing, which further confirmed his admiration.",
      "Ten Hag's admiration for the youngster has not surprised academy coaches and Under-21 manager Travis Binnion recently told the Manchester Evening News: \"If Toby had a clean 18 months and a clean two-and-a-half years with us, we would be talking about a really top young player.",
      "\"We’re talking about a really good young player with high potential. He joined us from another club [Brighton] and took a little while to get going. He couldn’t play in the FA Youth Cup run, so he was here but couldn’t play. He's also had a couple of injuries and nothing terrible.",
      "\"But when you have a spell out of the game and have a couple of injuries that stop you playing, it takes a while to get going, but when we signed him, we had no doubts about what he was capable of - he's a fantastic athlete and effective without the ball.",
      "\"Toby is also making great strides with the ball, so we’re talking there about someone who can be really effective in all moments of the game and I think that’s what you saw on tour.",
      "\"That's why the manager has involved him in numerous squads. I think he’s earned the trust of the manager and that’s not easy to do, so great credit to him, he’s a fantastic lad.",
      "\"He's got a superb attitude and he’s getting what he deserves. We just know the manager really likes him and the conversations I have with Fletch [Darren Fletcher] are along those lines and we talk about what’s right for his development, so what’s next and what does he need to do?\"",
      "The opportunity to sign Collyer from Brighton arose unexpectedly in 2022. He was regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country in his age group and a source at United has admitted they were surprised to get the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, which is around 10 miles from Brighton, and he was destined to break into the first team at the Amex Stadium until he was let go from the club.",
      "Justin Cochrane, who now works for Brentford, was the head of player development and coaching at United's academy when Collyer signed and he was instrumental in the move.",
      "Cochrane had worked with Collyer during his time with England's youth teams and the midfielder might have picked another Premier League club to join without his involvement.",
      "Collyer had to deal with the disappointment of leaving Brighton, but that blow was softened by United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham enquiring to sign him.",
      "The youngster's pre-existing relationship with Cochrane was a large factor in his relocation to Manchester, along with advice he received from mentors and some of his former coaches.",
      "One of the coaches who advised Collyer to move north was Mark Beard, who managed different youth age groups at Brighton during his time at the club, including their Under-18s. \"I was made aware of Toby probably from around the age of Under-14s,\" Beard told the MEN.",
      "\"I was the U18 manager and he used to come up and train with us, despite being much younger and I gave him his debut toward the end of his Under-15 year. He was always a little bit smaller back then and he seemed to shoot up in height suddenly when he became a scholar.",
      "\"Everyone would say he was the best player in the age group every year, but he was just one of them that you hardly noticed. He just got on with his job, there was no trouble and he worked hard.",
      "\"You wanted 11 Toby Collyers in your team because he’d work his socks off, run 13km a game and he took everything on board like a sponge. There were obviously a few things as he got older that we needed to work on and as he shot up a bit and he needed to redevelop.",
      "\"Toby sort of changed the way he played, so different types of passing, defending and he became a real good all-round midfielder once he'd learnt those two of three key areas.",
      "\"He could do two jobs in one. He could cover a position where he had a man to his left and a man to his right, and he could stay in the middle and if it was played to the right, he could get there and close the player down and would nick it. And his ball retention was different class.",
      "\"You don't get midfielders like him anymore, he was sort of like a Kante for Leicester, the holding mids who just sit there. You don’t notice them and they let the flair players do their bit.",
      "\"He breaks play up well, he’s good defensively, strong, quick, his fitness levels are different class and his passing range is really good, which is what we worked on. Because he’s such a good passer, we wanted him to use it more, switch the play, and that will come with confidence and more experience.\"",
      "Beard continued: \"I had such a good team at Brighton with Evan Ferguson and players like that, and everyone would say Evan was unbelievable, but he’d touch the ball 10 times, score a goal and run about 8km.",
      "\"Toby would run around 13km every single game, he’d have 200 touches of the ball and have the best defensive duel win-rate. His stats would be astronomical, honestly, absolutely ridiculous.",
      "\"You really don’t get that with many players. He’d be under the radar, but those are the players you want in your team more than anyone else because they’re a dying breed.",
      "\"You need balance in a team and if you had three Kobbie Mainoos, you can't play them all. You need a combination and Toby will do stuff Mainoo won’t. He will break the play up and get the ball to Mainoo, so I think Man United have missed a player like this for quite a while.",
      "\"He’s young and you can’t put too much pressure on him, but he can be a big player eventually because he does that horrible defensive side of the game that not a lot of midfielders who are brought up through the academy system at clubs want to do anymore.",
      "\"Everyone wanted to sign him and he didn’t deserve the treatment he got at Brighton in the end. I told Toby you've got to sign for United when he asked for advice.",
      "\"I said Chelsea won’t give you a chance because they’ve got 700 players and Tottenham aren’t known for bringing kids through. I said United was the place for him and it wasn’t just me who said it, there were a few others who gave him that advice and he’s done amazing.\"",
      "Collyer stayed in digs near Carrington when he joined United from Brighton two years ago - he was just 18 years old - but his decision to move 250 miles away from home is paying off.",
      "Collyer's athleticism has made a strong impression at United and he is seen as a player who has a role to play in the first-team squad this season. A source has described him as 'very professional' and said he puts in a lot of work in the gym, regularly going in after training sessions.",
      "He is known by members of staff to be confident but not a loud character and has been praised for his politeness and all-round good nature. United's academy intends to raise good people as well as excellent footballers and Collyer couldn't conduct himself better in all aspects.",
      "But beyond Collyer's freakish running stats and good character, there is a very talented and highly regarded player who could offer something in midfield that United have been lacking.",
      "Collyer is in the mould of a Michael Carrick or Darren Fletcher and should receive more first-team opportunities with Casemiro slowing down and showing signs of decline at 32 years old.",
      "He replaced Casemiro against Liverpool and could be his long-term replacement at the club.",

      "Manchester United's latest batch of new arrivals will know what they've been signed up to do. The short-term aims might be more low-key, but everyone at Old Trafford has one end goal in sight and that is to finally win the league again.",
      "England's most successful domestic club have now gone 11 years without a title and the manager and group of players who finally deliver top spot once again will forever be feted as heroes. The 20-time champions have been here before, however.",
      "Winning the league has proved to be beyond David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and quite possibly Erik ten Hag. Just as it was beyond the five permanent managers between the era of Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "That was a drought that stretched 26 years but Ferguson finally brought the good times back and re-established United as the undisputed kings of English football, although it took him a while to turn the club around.",
      "Viv Anderson saw the start of that journey at close quarters. He was Ferguson's first signing in the summer of 1987 and although he had left by the time the first title arrived in 1993, he had seen enough to know the Scot was getting things right.",
      "He had been at United as a schoolboy before being released but after a decade at Nottingham Forest and Arsenal the chance to return to Old Trafford was too good to turn down. As United ponder how to rebuild a title-winning machine under the stewardship of Ineos, Anderson's recollections of the late 1980s show just how hard it can be, as well as the importance of patience.",
      "\"I'd been at Manchester United many years before that and I knew what the club represents and I wanted to take that next step,\" he said. \"Alex was really, really adamant about the way he wanted to play and the disciplines he wanted to be in and I thought, yeah, this is going to be a good club to work for under the stewardship of Alex.\"",
      "Anderson, speaking to the Manchester Evening News at the launch of the latest Prostate United shirt challenge earlier this week, went on to make 69 appearances for the club before leaving for Sheffield Wednesday in 1991.",
      "But it is the story of his arrival at Old Trafford that is more interesting than his departure. At a time when the current leadership has made a point of signing players with a winning attitude and the right personality to play for United, Anderson was recruited for similar reasons. All it took to catch the eye of Ferguson was one minor skirmish in an Arsenal vs United fixture.",
      "\"I always remember Bryan Robson saying to me, 'the only reason he bought you is because you stood up to Norman Whiteside when we were playing for Arsenal',\" said Anderson.",
      "\"So he [Whiteside] got David Rocastle, who is sadly no longer with us, sent off in that game at Old Trafford. We were coming there on a run of 13 unbeaten games and we just got kicked from pillar to post and me and Norman had a little scuffle from time to time and [Ferguson] saw that I stood up to Norman, he was a big superstar at the time, and liked what he saw.\"",
      "When Anderson arrived in 1987 United were still six years away from ending that wait for a league title. Ferguson had taken over in November 1986 and the club had finished 11th in the old First Division that season.",
      "These days, most managers will lay out a philosophy to new signings, a plan to get a club to where they want to be and the role that player will play. When Anderson spoke to Ferguson, it was more straightforward.",
      "\"He said he bought me because he saw what he saw that day [against Arsenal] and he looked at my record,\" he said. \"I didn't miss many games over my career and he was very strong on that.",
      "\"He liked people that were going to be there week in, week out and subsequently, I get there and get injured and miss a lot of games so it doesn't always work out. People going to that club, the expectations are massive and you've got to embrace it or you fold.\"",
      "Ferguson suffered from those expectations. United finished second in his first full season, then 11th and 13th. In that third season, 1989/90, there were stories the manager was going to be sacked if they lost to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round.",
      "\"I remember playing at Forest in the FA Cup tie and prior to the game they were talking about Fergie out and this and that and the other,\" said Anderson. \"And we won the game. Mark Robins scored and we ended up going to the final that year and winning it and the rest is history.",
      "\"That game, we talked about it, but internally we never thought it was going to happen because he'd been there such a short period of time. It would always be difficult to get rid of managers at that time, you know, in the 80s, to get rid of a manager who hadn't been there that long.",
      "\"So we never thought it was going to happen. But we managed to win that day and, as I say, go on to win the cup that year.\"",
      "That fixture at the City Ground in January 1990 - now one of the most well-known stories in the club's history - came when United were on a run of eight league fixtures without a win. They would lose the two straight after the FA Cup win as well, against Derby and Norwich.",
      "So Anderson gets what it is like to play in a United team that isn't delivering, one that is under pressure and underperforming. This is a club with the history to expect titles, so when standards dip as they had then and have done again now, it can become difficult.",
      "\"I know what it's like to be at a club like Man United and get all the stick they're getting at the moment and it's hard going,\" he said.",
      "\"But you've got to get through it and the only way you can do it is by putting in decent performances. There's always going to be expectations at all the football clubs.",
      "\"You go to Arsenal, where I went, you can never be as good as the double winners. You go to Man United, you're never going to be as good as Best, Law and Charlton. So there are things you've got to get over and if you want to play for Manchester United you've got to take them on board and embrace it and try and do better or equal these people.",
      "\"[It's a hard club to manage] because of the expectations. Expectations, but from the supporters, from everybody connected with Manchester United whether it's abroad, at home, they expect to play in a certain way and they expect to win. And if they don't win, they make their feelings felt.\"",
      "Ferguson did, of course, eventually get it right. Anderson had left the club when the good times really started to roll but he sensed it was on the right track.",
      "\"I think he inherited some players that people in the building thought they were going to be half-decent players. Some didn't live up to expectations and so he had to persevere with those to see if the people who'd thought that were right,\" he said.",
      "\"Then he had the Giggs, Butts, Scholes, both Nevilles coming through, when we saw them playing you think these are gonna be proper players so it was a matter of time.",
      "\"He had those players coming through so Brian Kidd has to take a lot of credit for that and Eric Harrison, the people who scouted these players. How many do you get and you get those players I've mentioned, they go on to get 50, 60 caps for their country, they're very few and far between.",
      "\"They’re very exceptional players so the spade work had been done before him and he inherited these players, but he bought them through in the right way. Giggs, he wouldn't play many games, he'd come in, come out, same with the rest, he nurtured them really well to the level that right now you're good enough to start every game. They were superstars after all.\"",
      "Ferguson did it all back then. As Anderson says, he was the manager, the scout, the director of football. The game is very different now.",
      "One example of Ferguson's ability to think outside the box and make the most of people who had played for him was his role for Anderson early in the club's European adventures, when he would come back to offer some advice to the youngsters.",
      "\"I came back for European games when the [Class of 92] were playing, just to give them my experience of playing in European games. So I used to come back from Sheffield way,\" he said.",
      "\"I just used to talk to them about those games, I'd been to the level that they were striving to get to, so any words of advice I could give them I would do.\"",
      "Right now it would take a leap of faith to believe Ten Hag is on a similar path to Ferguson and although Anderson insists United can't keep changing the manager, he accepts it is time for the Dutchman to deliver.",
      "\"He’s changed his backroom staff, they've given him money, it's now time to perform,\" he said. \"It's really important that United get back to winning ways. Bad start but you know, top four is really important, Champions League has got to be paramount for the players and the manager, so that proves success which we didn't have last year.\"",
      "Anderson is still a regular back at Old Trafford and he was in Manchester earlier this week helping to launch the new Prostate United shirt ahead of their latest fundraising initiative.",

      "Manchester United fans always wonder which youngster from the academy might be the next to make their senior debut.",
      "There have been 251 youngsters from the academy to make first-team debuts at Old Trafford and that is an extraordinary club achievement that is worth shouting about.",
      "Toby Collyer is the most recent academy product to have made his senior bow and perhaps Ethan Ennis, who has three goals in four games this season, could be the next.",
      "It was a big deal when United signed Ennis from Liverpool in August 2021. He scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, but disaster struck a year later when he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee.",
      "ACL injuries are feared by footballers and can have devastating consequences on a career, but Ennis has made a full recovery and was gradually eased back into action last season.",
      "Last term was about Ennis finding his feet again - this season is about him finding his groove again. The 19-year-old has been in outstanding form, scoring for the U21s against Arsenal, Barnsley and Blackburn, and he's been present in first-team training sessions at Carrington.",
      "Ennis looked sharp in friendlies against Rosenborg and Rangers this summer, coming on from the bench under the watchful eye of Erik ten Hag, and is a dynamic winger worth keeping a look out for.",
      "He is beginning to make up for lost time after his serious knee injury and a source has said his professionalism in and out of training hasn't gone unnoticed at United.",
      "Ennis signed a new United contract this summer, as his previous deal with the club expired in the summer of 2025, and it's understood he's been challenged to deliver consistently strong displays - throughout the entire 90 minutes of a match - by coaches in the academy.",
      "The youngster is currently rising to that challenge and making improvements to his game, which means he's putting himself in contention to make a first-team debut this season.",
      "United decided it would be best for Ennis' development for him to spend the first half of the season with the Under-21s before his situation was assessed in January - he could benefit from a loan - but there might be a chance to make a debut in a cup competition before then.",
      "There is a lot to like about Ennis. He has the physical build of a professional footballer, he glides with the ball on the wing and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",
      "Ennis is a goalscoring winger and knows where the net is, and one United fan recently compared his style to Andrei Kanchelskis, who signed for Sir Alex Ferguson in 1991.",
      "Coaches argue that comparisons are unhelpful and reiterate a player is an individual and unique to themselves, but they can provide insight into how a youngster might develop.",
      "The Kanchelskis comparison has merit, but there's actually a player currently in the Premier League who Ennis is eerily similar to and that is Newcastle winger Harvey Barnes.",
      "Barnes is not a name that will excite United fans, but he has proven himself in the top flight with Leicester and Newcastle and is a winger who possesses excellent finishing ability.",
      "Leicester sold the 26-year-old to Newcastle in a deal worth £39million in 2023 and United would love Ennis, who has similar qualities as a winger, to develop similarly.",
      "Not many wingers have such a knack for finding the back of the net. It's worth following an academy game to watch how Ennis strikes a ball and he is potent when cutting inside or arriving in the box, which is a brilliant skill to have as an emerging young player in the academy.",
      "Comparisons with Barnes might be sniffed at but it's a compliment to Ennis.",

      "There may be no competitive football taking place this weekend in the top flight but United fans will be descending on Old Trafford this afternoon as a Legends XI which includes Wayne Rooney, takes on a Celtic XI to raise money for the Manchester United Foundation. While a host of greats will be on the pitch today for a worthy cause, Erik ten Hag will be keen to keep one eye on his senior squad.",
      "With the Turkish transfer window closing on September 18, a lot of reports are circulating around United players who could be shipped off. Antony is currently being linked with a loan move to Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce while Casemiro has been tipped to join Galatasaray.",
      "Neither man has had the start to the season they would have wanted but it will be intriguing to see if either Turkish club would be able to do enough to tempt them to leave the Reds. Meanwhile, United received a timely boost this week as Leny Yoro stepped up his rehabilitation from injury.",
      "The centre-back no longer requires crutches to walk as he looks to get himself back in contention sooner rather than later.",
      "Follow our live updates below for all the latest news from Old Trafford...",
      "While it may seem that Ugarte is in the prime position to take over from Casemiro permanently, Keane believes there is still a place in the squad for the Brazilian.",
      "He told Stick to Football, brought to you by Sky Bet:",
      "I wouldn’t be writing him off yet. Maybe his role in the team if he gets back in, gets a couple of games under his belt, might be higher up the pitch. The first thing we always say is that he can’t get around the pitch but when you see him going forward he does have an eye for a pass and set-pieces, how many times do you see him get his head on it? Will Casemiro get Man United back to competing with Man City? Of course not. But the deal is done, he’s at the club.",
      "Following the international break, United will travel to the South Coast for a tricky clash with Southampton in the Premier League.",

      "United winger Antony pledged to MEN Sport at the beginning of August that we would see his name connected with goals and assists this season.",
      "Unfortunately for the 24-year-old, his ability to keep this promise has so far been hampered by a lack of opportunities in the first team. The Brazilian winger has played just one minute in four matches so far this season and has had to settle for a place on the bench as the likes of; Marcus Rashford, Amad and Alejandro Garnacho have been entrusted to run the wings.",
      "In the dying embers of the Community Shield penalty shootout defeat to bitter rivals Manchester City, manager Erik ten Hag even turned to now-Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho ahead of the Brazilian when he assessed his options off the bench. During the international break, reports have suggested a loan move to Turkey could be on the cards for Antony with Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce reportedly keen to give him a chance.",

      "It is admirable that Antony wishes to remain at United and fight for his place in the starting XI.",
      "However, it must be stressed that just because a player wishes to stay at Old Trafford does not mean they will necessarily get their wish.",
      "Antony is clearly out of favour at the moment and United may see a loan until January as advantageous for all parties especially as it would give him an opportunity to be fresh and firing for the second half of the season.",
      "Speaking earlier this year, the 24-year-old's agent Junior Pedroso was adamant that Antony had made his intentions to stay at United clear:",
      "I see reports about a potential exit on loan. Antony’s plan is clear: Manchester United. He wants to stay, he’s only focused on Man United. We already spoke about that with the club.",

      "Gaaei told Tipsbladet:",
      "\"Of course, you hope for (the transfer to happen) when such a good Dane is written about. He is one of the best in the Nordics. So I hoped for that, but it didn’t happen. Now, we just have to do it as well as possible.”",
      "For the second summer in a row, Manchester United didn't spend a transfer fee on a player older than 27 as they look to pivot towards a strategy that focuses on those either in their prime or yet to hit their highest level.",
      "Those windows have come under two different models and if it was perhaps coincidental in 2023, it's a clear shift in 2024 in what was Ineos' first summer as the primary decision-makers at the club.",
      "Their £200m spree saw an 18-year-old, two 23-year-olds, a 25-year-old and a 26-year-old arrive.",
      "Manchester United successfully managed to strengthen their midfield in the summer transfer window with the late signing of Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Erik ten Hag plays a midfield three with Fernandes often joining the forward line. However, United are often short when the Portugal playmaker is unavailable.",
      "Fortunately, despite the transfer window closing a week ago, sporting director Dan Ashworth could still register an attacking midfielder.",

      "Adrien Rabiot has long been linked with United, and even saw the club agree a pre-agreement with Juventus in 2022 before talks broke down.",
      "The midfielder is still a free agent having left Turin at the end of his contract upon the conclusion of last season. The Frenchman has been linked with a number of outfits but remains unemployed.",
      "A report from Teamtalk claims United are still admirers of Rabiot and are in the mix to sign him although face competition from Newcastle. The report claims Galatasaray have tabled an offer before the player.",
      "Manchester United's exciting youngster Shea Lacey could return to action after the international break.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands Lacey has been sidelined with a muscle injury but has made progress in his recovery and will be in contention to play after the break.",
      "Lacey is in contention to feature for the Under-18s against Newcastle on Saturday, September 14 and it's thought he will be carefully handled and eased back into action.",

      "\"How can they lose 3-0 at home to Liverpool? Their former players must be mad after what they saw during that game at Old Trafford. It’s simply not acceptable.",

At the training ground they must have two dressing rooms, three pitches and 12 physios.",
      "\"The club are not the only ones responsible for the situation. It also comes down to the players. How can Sancho bring himself to sign for Chelsea after what happened at Manchester United? He was loaned to Borussia Dortmund, then went back to United, and now he's off to Chelsea who have 40 or so players and he is just one of them.\"",

      "“He returned on the pitch but it will take a while before he is up. Everyone has seen, it [the injury] happens in the first game [pre-season tour], so he needs also to build some fitness.”",
      "Around 30 minutes after Ten Hag's press conference, Hojlund drove out of Carrington, wearing shaded sunglasses in his Range Rover, and stopped for autographs and photos. \"I pulled my hamstring but I'm okay now,\" said Hojlund when a small child who was wearing a United replica with his name and number asked why he hadn't played this season.",
      "Hojlund has returned to training on the grass at Carrington, which usually indicates a return to full training is around two weeks away and that is excellent news for United, who have sorely missed his presence in attack in the opening few games of the new Premier League season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been used as a false nine and Joshua Zirkzee started down the middle against Liverpool but Hojlund is a natural centre-forward and is more effective in that role. What he brings to the team, being able to stretch a defence with his pace and getting in behind the opposition, is unique and the injury he sustained in pre-season was unfortunate.",
      "Hojlund tweaked his hamstring after opening the scoring against Arsenal in Los Angeles and his goal was the type nobody else in the United squad could produce - he used his body brilliantly, shielded the ball with his strength and used his acceleration to evade his marker.",
      "The 21-year-old is built in the mould of a traditional striker and if his finishing has improved for this season, he has the ability to significantly better his haul of 16 goals last term. Hojlund's return will be a huge boost and he is expected to be available against Southampton when football resumes after the international break. United are guaranteed to create chances against the relegation candidates and Hojlund could mark his return with a bang.",
      "Whether Luke Shaw returns to the squad alongside Hojlund at St Mary's remains to be seen. The defender hasn't played for United this season, despite playing for England at Euro 2024, and Ten Hag didn't give an update on his situation at his latest press conference.",
      "United said on August 13 that Shaw would miss the opening games of the Premier League season due to a calf injury sustained at the start of pre-season training.",
      "The clash against Southampton comes on September 14 and four weeks should be enough time to recover from a calf strain, providing it's not serious. That teases the possibility of Shaw and Hojlund making the XI on the south coast.",
      "United have scraped past Fulham, defeated by Brighton and hammered by Liverpool, which has made the Southampton game an early season must-win encounter with the following three matches challenging. Crystal Palace away, Tottenham at home and Aston Villa away await and United must get back to winning ways to ease pressure on Ten Hag.",
      "The chances of breezing past Southampton with minimal fuss will increase if Hojlund and Shaw are back from the sidelines. They are two hugely important players in how Ten Hag wants to play and the latter's passing qualities are particularly important for building up from the back.",
      "Ten Hag will give a fresh update on Hojlund and Shaw at his press conference on Thursday and fans will be desperately hoping he confirms their return to action against Southampton. It's also imperative that when they return to fitness, they maintain a clean bill of health.",

      "In their seven months in charge at Manchester United Ineos have shown that the attraction of working at Old Trafford remains as strong as ever, despite the club's on-pitch struggles.",
      "For those working in the background, the challenge of restoring United to the pinnacle of the domestic game is clearly an attractive one. Sir Jim Ratcliffe set out the ambition of recruiting the 'best in class' and he has been as good as his word.",
      "Ineos appointed Omar Berrada from Manchester City and Dan Ashworth from Newcastle United to fill their two most important roles and Jason Wilcox swapped a job as a director of football at Southampton to become United's technical director.",
      "Christopher Vivell was coming in off the back of a short and infilling spell at Chelsea but the German still had a reputation as one of the shrewdest talent-spotters and recruitment experts in the game. On Monday, another former Manchester City employee will walk into the club on the opposite side of town.",
      "Recruiting Sam Erith as interim performance director is a significant feather in the cap for Ineos. Erith spent 11 years at City as head of sports science and lead for human performance. Erith was highly regarded at the Etihad and held similar roles with Tottenham and the England national team.",
      "He can be a significant asset for United and will work to create an elite performance environment around Carrington, focusing on the first-team squad and supporting Erik ten Hag.",
      "This is now a very different club than the one Ten Hag walked into in the summer of 2022 and found to be underpowered. Ralf Rangnick had flagged some of these issues to United and his permanent replacement has spoken of the culture and environment he inherited.",
      "\"So I think in general when I came in at Man United, the standards were not right. That’s true,\" Ten Hag said in the summer of 2023.",
      "\"I demand the highest standards in sleep, recovery and nutrition because that makes the difference if you can perform every third or fourth day. That is the demand for every top football player, so at Man United we are demanding the highest standards.\"",
      "Some of that is on the players but when you look at the depth of the structure now at the club, compared to 2022, it's hardly surprising they were falling short. John Murtough had only just appointed Andy O'Boyle as his deputy and they were spreading themselves too thin.",
      "How that has changed now. Ten Hag has all the support he needs, both in terms of recruitment and more general support. He speaks to Wilcox almost daily and will now benefit from Erith's expertise in creating elite environments.",
      "Ten Hag spoke in July about how his role had narrowed - for the better - and that is allowing him to commit a greater focus to training, improving players and developing a game model.",
      "\"That basis has been greatly strengthened. A lot has been taken away from me in scouting and recruitment. That is necessary,\" he told AD.",
      "“You need a very strong structure in scouting and transfer policy. I can only be happy that I have Dan (Ashworth), Jason (Wilcox) and Christopher (Vivell) at my side. The club has acquired incredible know-how and knowledge of the market that helps me.",
      "“We have only been working with these new people for a few weeks but Ashworth is close by – a room away. The new owners take me more into the process. It’s early days but the signs are very good.”",
      "Since that interview, the structure around Ten Hag has been strengthened further. Now he can focus on his primary job, which is shaping a team that can deliver results.",

      "Wan-Bissaka at right-back and Dalot at left-back would have been the selection of most fans in the circumstances, but Erik ten Hag thought differently and was coy when asked about the decision.",
      "\"I can't go too deep in that fact,\" said Ten Hag. \"But they have both, of course, their skills, their contribution to the team, so we have a clear idea of what is ideally [the situation]. Sometimes, we have to adjust this but lately it has worked out very good, and we want to keep that consistency with Diogo and Garnacho on the right side because they have their connection.",
      "\"Also, Diogo, I know, has a very good connection with Antony. So, most of the times we want to keep such routines and that is why I chose lately for this partnership. To keep Diogo more on the right side and then, lately, Azza came in and did a very good job over on the left side.\"",
      "Ten Hag explained as much as he could reveal and it seemed the thought process was that Dalot was performing so well on the right that it would be wrong to disrupt his rhythm.",
      "Dalot has played at left-back during different stages of his career and is competent on that side, but Wan-Bissaka was chosen to play there for the first time in his career last season.",
      "It's fair to say eyebrows were raised when Wan-Bissaka was initially played there in January. He is an excellent one-on-one defender, but he's hardly known for his technical ability, which suggested he might struggle to play in a position he'd never taken up before.",
      "Fast forward to the September international break, Wan-Bissaka has left for West Ham and Dalot has started each Premier League game against Fulham, Brighton and Liverpool at left-back, with new signing Noussair Mazraoui playing on the right side of defence.",
      "Sources said Mazraoui was signed because of his versatility, but he's got the nod at right-back and that has seen Dalot look out of sorts in the opening games of the season.",
      "Although Dalot has plenty of experience of playing at left-back, his attacking threat is reduced when he doesn't start on the right and Mazraoui isn't compensating for that enough.",
      "It's been fascinating to see Ten Hag play Dalot at left-back this term considering he was so adamant about playing Dalot on the right at the beginning of the year that he played Wan-Bissaka in a position he'd never played to keep him there - which was a statement in itself.",
      "However, Mazraoui is comfortable on the left and it seems the best option to play him there and relocate Dalot to the right when football resumes after the international break.",
      "The 25-year-old is often seen making overlapping runs and crossing the ball using his right foot when he starts there and he's unable to be as effective when starting on the left.",
      "Dalot struggled with pacy Fulham winger Adama Traore in the opening clash, he improved against Brighton but regressed against Liverpool's fluid and impressive attack.",
      "Casemiro's mistakes were responsible for Liverpool's goals in the first half, but Dalot couldn't prevent Mohamed Salah from providing the assists for Luis Diaz's brace and Mazraoui's positioning was questionable throughout, including for Trent Alexander-Arnold's disallowed goal.",
      "If something isn't working, it makes sense to make a change and 'experimenting' against Southampton with Dalot at right-back and Mazraoui on the other side, providing Luke Shaw isn't back in the squad, is the best option based on the evidence of the games so far.",
      "Dalot won the Players' Player of the Year award for his consistently strong performances last season and should return to his strongest position sooner rather than later.",

      "Ugarte, 23, started for Uruguay in their home World Cup qualifier against Paraguay on Friday night, playing the best part of 80 minutes before being substituted. It was the defensive midfielder's first match since starting for his country in the Copa America third-place play-off versus Canada in mid-July.",
      "During the two months without playing, Ugarte spent some time on holiday after the tournament in the United States before returning for pre-season training with his then-club Paris Saint-Germain. He did not play upon his return, with a move to United in the works.",

      "READ MORE:United have genius £51m transfer plan as dream Casemiro solution finally clear",
      "But despite there being almost eight weeks between his last two matches, Ugarte did not show it, starring for Uruguay in the 0-0 draw in new head coach Gustavo Alfaro's debut. The defensive midfielder sat deep in a midfield three, flanked by Brian Rodriguez and Real Madrid's Federico Valverde.",
      "He also played alongside former United winger Facundo Pellistri, who moved on during the summer transfer window, joining the Greek club Panathinaikos. The stalemate keeps Uruguay second in the South American standings after seven matches, with the top six qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "They next play on Tuesday night away at Venezuela, who are five points behind them in fifth. Ugarte will thus seemingly return to England at some stage on Wednesday next week.",
      "United then play Saturday lunchtime away at Southampton in the first match following the international break. With such a tight turnaround and Casemiro not being in the Brazil squad, Ten Hag could name Ugarte on the bench rather than in the starting lineup, but a Premier League debut for the summer signing during that match now seems likely.",

With competitive action taking a pause for the weekend as the Nations League begins, now appears to be a time when the club's owners are taking stock.",
      "In our latest look at the media headlines associated with United, we have analysed how two players are being eyed to depart Old Trafford and the stance from Ineos on Erik ten Hag's future.",
      "According to Give Me Sport, United are adamant that this will be the final season Casemiro and Christian Eriksen represent the Reds. Both players are believed to have been informed their time is coming to an end and Dan Ashworth has been presented with the task of finding youthful replacements for them.",
      "While Galatasaray have been linked with Casemiro, it is thought they are unlikely to complete a deal before the window closes.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is unsurprising to hear that United want both Casemiro and Eriksen gone. Unfortunately while both have offered something during their time at Old Trafford, neither are the future of the club. The priority would be to get Casemiro off the books quickly considering his age and ultimately both are necessities needing to be done. Ashworth will certainly be earning his money to find youthful replacements for the midfield duo and United may need to bank on getting a good transfer fee in for Casemiro to help fund those deals.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs, Ten Hag's future remains in his own hands and Ineos do not have any current plans to replace him. Jacobs did note though that Gareth Southgate remained a person of interest for the United boardroom and it will not escape them that he is a free agent come the new year.",
      "What MEN Sport says: One thing that has failed United on numerous occasions since Sir Alex Ferguson retired is the amount of strain they were receiving from the boardroom as they continuously eyed their next move. Ineos need to be different. They chose to stick with Ten Hag and as such it is good to see that they are willing to give him a chance. Three matches do not make a season and there is plenty of time to come good. The return of Leny Yoro will be a big boost for Ten Hag and fans will expect a result come 3pm a week today.",

      "Premier League clubs have urged for greater consistency in games regarding new refereeing directives.",
      "Before the start of the 2024/25 season, officials visited each team to detail what they would be working to tackle, including preventing the quick restart of matches and players crowding around referees.",
      "One of the points briefed was regarding referees being particularly vigilant about punishing players delaying quick free kicks. The warning was that any offence deemed \"clear, deliberate and impactful on the game\" would result in a yellow card. This push for stricter officiating comes after statistics showed an increase from 118 incidents of delaying restarts in the 2022/23 season to 215 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Last weekend, Arsenal's Declan Rice became the first player to be punished by the stricter enforcement, receiving a booking that led to his sending off against Brighton. The decision led to many questioning the decision with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta left seething at full-time.",
      "Eight separate incidents from last weekend have circulated online of players delaying a quick restart without punishment, involving Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot. There were also incidents with Marc Cucurella, Marc Guehi, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Dejan Kulusevski, Cole Palmer and Pedro Porro.",
      "During the second half of United's 3-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, Dalot fouled his opponent before delaying the restart by throwing the ball away. By the letter of the law, the defender should have received a yellow card but referee Antony Taylor chose not to punish the offence.",
      "Dermot Gallagher and his regular Ref Watch segment on Sky Sports News every Monday has also been picked up on by fans. Gallagher, who is not part of the PGMOL team and instead works for Sky, defended referee Chris Kavanagh's decision to send off Rice for a second yellow card after he seemed to kick the ball away before Joel Veltman could take a free kick, resulting in him kicking the Arsenal midfielder.",
      "Late last season, Wolves attempted to ban VAR amidst widespread dissatisfaction with refereeing standards and the PGMOL. Concerns among clubs existed at the end of last season regarding the PGMOL, with some raising questions about why there has not been a significant improvement in standards under Howard Webb.",
      "This issue is likely to be discussed in future Premier League meetings - with the next scheduled for the end of September - while the PGMOL maintains that decision accuracy remains at an all-time high. The PGMOL is also fast-tracking former players into their ranks. Its officials are also on UEFA and FIFA lists and command respect across Europe.",

      "Emmanuel Petit has expressed his frustration over Jadon Sancho's decision to become Chelsea's latest addition on deadline day.",
      "Sancho - who had previously shown signs of stress under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United - once again left the club on loan this summer. After spending the latter half of last season back at Borussia Dortmund, he opted for a return to London for the rest of this season (at least).",
      "However, former Chelsea midfielder Petit is struggling to comprehend what drove ex-Manchester City prospect Sancho to make the move to Stamford Bridge, considering the intense competition for places in west London. The Frenchman even joked about the lack of space in Chelsea's dressing room due to their active recruitment drive during the summer.",
      "\"When I saw they had signed Jadon Sancho on Deadline Day, I wondered if there was even any shirt numbers left for him,\" Petit told sports betting site BetVictor (via football.london). \"Imagine him opening the door to the dressing room and seeing so many players they don't all fit in the same dressing room! At the training ground they must have two dressing rooms, three pitches and 12 physios.",
      "\"The club are not the only ones responsible for the situation. It also comes down to the players. How can Sancho bring himself to sign for Chelsea after what happened at Manchester United? He was loaned to Borussia Dortmund, then went back to United, and now he's off to Chelsea who have 40 or so players and he is just one of them.\"",
      "Premier League and FA Cup-winner Petit continued his scathing verdict of Sancho's move and the timing of his decision. The Frenchman added: \"Hasn't he had enough of moving around clubs, losing his way on the pitch and losing his confidence? Now he's at a club that has no consistency, lacking in confidence and results. If he's not there for the money, what is he there for?\"",
      "The 1998 World Cup-winner isn't alone in casting doubts over Chelsea's recent transfer strategy. Enzo Maresca's first summer in charge saw a staggering 11 new players arrive, and while just as many have departed, the club made a net loss for the third straight year.",
      "Before Sancho's arrival was even considered, Chelsea had already splashed out approximately £100million on forward signings Pedro Neto and Joao Felix. Chelsea again recruited heavily in the area despite the presence of wingers like Cole Palmer, Christopher Nkunku, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, and Carney Chukwuemeka.",
      "Sancho, 24, will turn his move to Chelsea permanent next summer in a deal worth £25m if the Blues finish 14th or higher in the Premier League. While the financial benefits of this move compared to his United terms are unclear, there's another aspect that Petit might be overlooking Sancho's long-held love for Chelsea.",
      "\"I'd probably say Frank Lampard,\" he told talkSPORT in 2021 when quizzed about his England football hero. \"I was a Chelsea fan growing up, I can't lie! Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard were my favourite players at the time.",
      "\"I just love Frank Lampard and how he played his game; he was so direct and so composed on the ball. I like things like that.\"",
      "Given his London roots and admiration for Chelsea legends, it's perhaps no shock Sancho has hooked up with the Blues. However, his immediate mission is to disprove any sceptics (like Petit) by securing a place in Maresca's lineup and underlining his dedication extends beyond financial incentives.",

      "Having won two trophies in as many seasons, it is easy to understand why Erik ten Hag is gauging progression on silverware.",
      "The Manchester United manager is proud of leading the club to the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup. The former saw Ten Hag win a trophy at the first available opportunity, while the FA Cup success against Manchester City in May kept him in a job.",
      "United have fast become a club more prosperous in cup competitions than progressing in the Premier League. Later this month, United will kick off their Carabao Cup campaign, welcoming Barnsley to Old Trafford, before hosting FC Twente in their Europa League opener eight days later. United will have ambitions of going deep into both competitions.",
      "United will also want to defend their FA Cup crown. In the event of reaching the final of all three competitions they face the prospect of playing 67 matches. They played 52 times last season and 62 in 2022/23. The new-look Europa League format means United will play eight games in the first phase of the competition, a rise of two, and the prospect of a play-off round would add two more fixtures in February.",
      "Ten Hag is going to require as many options as possible to keep his squad fresh. He will also be praying United's luck changes on the injury front.",
      "United strengthened their squad in key areas in the summer and each position is now covered with two or more options, giving Ten Hag a sufficient level of depth when everyone is fit and available. But for all of United's success in the summer, concerns have been raised about their failure to bring in a left-back. Luke Shaw has not played for United since February and Tyrell Malacia has been absent since the final day of the 2022/23 season.",
      "In their absence, Diogo Dalot has started United's opening three league matches at left-back. Once Shaw returns from his latest lay-off, Dalot will switch to the right and compete with Noussair Mazraoui for a starting berth. The latter is also capable of operating at left-back.",
      "But United's failure to sign a recognised left-back in the summer could prove costly given the season is going to require regular rotation. When you consider United's two senior left-backs have not played a single minute of club football between them since February, it does not paint a particularly positive picture. Shaw, as brilliant as he is when fit, simply isn't available often enough. And even once he gets himself back up to speed again, there is no chance of Ten Hag being able to rely on him game after game.",
      "\"Shaw is the best left-back in the world, he is so good,\" said Ten Hag, speaking last season. \"But he had a very serious injury at the beginning of his career. As a result, he will never be able to play 60 games in a year.\"",
      "Malacia is available even less frequently. With potentially a heavier fixture list than ever before to come, United could be left with a transfer regret.",

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",
      "\"Harry Maguire had an issue in the first half and, luckily for us, he overcame and recovered from it,\" Ten Hag said with relief. \"You can see the second half he was up there and then he can express his leadership, he can express his defensive qualities and rest on the ball, we especially needed that in this back four.\"",
      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",

      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw.

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",

Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",

      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",

      "United sources say Brailsford has been attending meetings this month to gauge the performance challenge at United, whose title drought is certain to tick past 12 years.",
      "Although Ineos plan to hire a sporting director and potentially a head of recruitment, the incumbent football director John Murtough wants to remain at the club.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United winger Antony pledged to MEN Sport at the beginning of August that we would see his name connected with goals and assists this season.",
      "Unfortunately for the 24-year-old, his ability to keep this promise has so far been hampered by a lack of opportunities in the first team. The Brazilian winger has played just one minute in four matches so far this season and has had to settle for a place on the bench as the likes of; Marcus Rashford, Amad and Alejandro Garnacho have been entrusted to run the wings.",
      "In the dying embers of the Community Shield penalty shootout defeat to bitter rivals Manchester City, manager Erik ten Hag even turned to now-Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho ahead of the Brazilian when he assessed his options off the bench. During the international break, reports have suggested a loan move to Turkey could be on the cards for Antony with Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce reportedly keen to give him a chance.",
      "There is more than a week left of the Turkish window so it does provide an opportunity for United to loan out their stars. However, is this the best move for Antony or United? MEN Sport has asked its United writers to provide their suggestions for the winger.",
      "If Erik ten Hag sees Antony as nothing more than a backup option this season after trusting him unreservedly before that, a loan move seems the wisest option. By his own admission, Antony had a difficult campaign last year.",
      "With £86m invested into the Brazilian, United are certainly not in a position where they could wipe their hands of Antony entirely. His stock is incredibly low at present and selling him for the sort of fees United were reportedly offered for him over the summer, just £25m, would be incredibly bad business. It may not even be Antony's best option at this point.",
      "A loan move to Turkey presents Antony with a fresh start and a platform to rediscover his form away from the prying eyes of the Premier League. We all know that Mourinho would be a hard taskmaster for the winger and perhaps that is what he needs to get back on track.",
      "We may have only seen a very small glimpse of his talents so far but if/when he rediscovers that form, United will have some player.",
      "At this stage, Antony should stay at United, at least until the January transfer window opens - despite the window in Turkey remaining open for a little longer. United's squad does not have much depth out wide, with only Amad, Garnacho and Rashford otherwise able to cover both flanks.",
      "Pre-season showed there will be minutes for the 24-year-old, with United's participation in the EFL Cup and Europa League beginning later this month. Impressing in those competitions, especially the latter, will likely do more good than agreeing to a last-minute loan move to Turkey.",
      "It is also conceivable that there will be occasions when one of United's wingers will not be available for whatever reasons. Should that scenario happen, and Antony is either playing elsewhere or, even worse, warming someone else's bench, it will not reflect well on the club, especially after already letting Jadon Sancho go.",
      "Cashing in on the former Brazil international also seems like a non-starter, as they will not recoup anywhere close to the fee spent on Antony, and there is still too long left on his contract for United to cut their losses.",
      "On a personal level, a move to a European-playing Turkish club would probably be an ideal step for Antony - but the player would likely scoff at such a proposal. And it would also be a touch negligent from United.",
      "Many, perhaps justifiably, will not see the exit of Jadon Sancho as that impactful but United would be left with just two natural right-wing options should Antony exit. Amad is in great form but has yet to properly play a full senior season for United while Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford are less effective on the right.",
      "Match-goers can easily argue that both could produce more output on the right than Antony is anyway, and the Brazilian hasn’t built the strongest case to null those suggestions. But an Antony exit seems unlikely at this point, post-deadline day.",
      "While United would not be able to bring in a suitable replacement, with free agent options unappealing, an exit for Antony would also make Erik ten Hag blush.",
      "It would mean him accepting that his £85m signing - the second-most expensive in club history - has under-delivered and flopped. At a time when the manager needs boardroom backing, such a transfer seems counter-productive.",
      "It's hard to see any way that Antony turns things around at United. The Brazilian has become a scapegoat for United's poor decisions in the transfer market and is nowhere near Ten Hag's starting lineup anymore.",
      "There's no chance of United recouping much of the money spent to sign him but getting his wages off their books would be a big boost. However, I think it's probably one to revisit next summer when more replacements will be available.",
      "Another injury or two in attack will leave the Reds stretched and Antony does at least offer some depth. There is an argument to play more academy players with Shea Lacey a promising option who plays in Antony's position. But it's probably still too soon for the 17-year-old.",
      "At this stage, I think even a loan move for Antony won't be of much benefit, particularly when considering the number of matches Ten Hag's team are set to play this season and with little chance of signing a suitable replacement in January. I expect him to be on the move next summer though.",
      "For me, Antony should stick at United until at least January. United are not blessed with too much depth out wide and have just Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford to cover those areas following the deadline day exit of Jadon Sancho to Chelsea on a season-long loan.",
      "I don't see how Antony can turn around his disappointing start to life at United - scoring 11 goals and adding five assists in 83 appearances - but he could still do a job if required. Erik ten Hag and United cannot take the risk of letting him leave to Turkey in case they get a couple of injuries.",
      "From a personal point of view, I could see the appeal for Antony to depart as he goes in search of regular game time. He has played just a minute of Premier League football and that is not enough for someone of his calibre. There is potential there, but we just need to see it on a regular basis.",
      "What United should do and what Antony should do are probably two different things. It makes perfect sense for United to want to cash in on whatever they can get for a player who has failed to impress, at best.",
      "Antony, though, is on a good wage at Old Trafford and has years left on his contract. The manager is not in a particularly stable position either, so perhaps he could back himself to outlast Ten Hag, if things really turned sour.",
      "Leaving at this stage isn't helpful for either party though. Antony has missed any chance to get a pre-season under his belt whilst United would be simply kicking the can down the road.",
      "It's unlikely that he is going to become a first-team staple so an exit in the next 12 months really is needed. Just how willing Antony will be to help United out with this is less clear though.",
      "In an ideal world, the best option for United would probably see Antony head out on loan and refind the form that prompted the club to move for him in the first place. He could then bring that form back to United and complete a turnaround of his career with the club.",
      "But it’s not very often that the ideal scenario plays out, and it may ultimately be best for the club if he sticks around until at least January. After letting Jadon Sancho leave the club on deadline day, it does leave United slightly short on wide options, and Antony may have to be called upon if injuries and suspensions hit.",
      "While a lack of game time is not ideal in trying to play himself back into form, it may be a case of needs must for both United and the player. It could, however, change depending on what business the club does in January.",
      "Bringing in another wide attacker could allow Antony to then go out on a temporary deal for the remainder of the season. By the time the window comes around, the Brazilian will also have more options with more transfer windows around the world open.",

      "Manchester United defender Leny Yoro is walking without crutches as he steps up his rehabilitation from a foot injury.",
      "Yoro fractured his metatarsal in the first half of the 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in Los Angeles, which was the opening fixture of United's pre-season tour in the United States.",
      "The 18-year-old underwent surgery at the beginning of August to address the problem and November was earmarked for his return. Yoro was unveiled to Old Trafford before the Fulham game and was using crutches but his recovery is progressing and they are no longer needed.",
      "That represents a positive step in his return to action and Yoro has been in the gym at Carrington as he works with United's physio team to prepare him to return to full fitness.",
      "Yoro was one of five first-team signings for United this summer and demonstrated his quality in just his first appearance for the club in a friendly against Rangers in July.",
      "The defender only had one training session under his belt when he played that game and it was impressive to see him perform with teammates he'd only known for a few days.",
      "Although Yoro's injury has been considered a huge blow, club sources are viewing his lay-off as an opportunity for him to settle into life in Manchester and familiarise himself with his new surroundings, an approach Sir Alex Ferguson would take with new signings who picked up injuries.",
      "United believe Yoro can develop into one of the best defenders in the world and his signing from Lille in a deal that could rise to €70million was seen as a coup.",
      "Ten Hag said on Yoro's injury: \"That's part of football, that's part of top football especially, that you come into, you go to the edge, every player has to go to the edge.",
      "\"And yeah, then injuries are not avoidable. But of course, we have to be ready as a club and as a team to cover this and the players are dealing very well with this setback. They (Yoro and Rasmus Hojlund) are very positive, they are already recovering and they will return.\"",

      "For the second summer in a row, Manchester United didn't spend a transfer fee on a player older than 27 as they look to pivot towards a strategy that focuses on those either in their prime or yet to hit their highest level.",
      "Those windows have come under two different models and if it was perhaps coincidental in 2023, it's a clear shift in 2024 in what was Ineos' first summer as the primary decision-makers at the club. Their £200m spree saw an 18-year-old, two 23-year-olds, a 25-year-old and a 26-year-old arrive.",
      "United felt they blended youth and experience, given the two signings at the upper end of that age scale - Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui - have been regulars at the highest end of the European game for several seasons.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear he views recruitment as the biggest opportunity to improve United and that he wants to sign the next superstar, rather than spend millions on players who might already have their best years behind them. Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Casemiro all fitted into that bracket in recent seasons.",
      "There is also a focus on bringing in the best young players from around the world to strengthen the academy and try and provide a flow towards the first team. In an era of tighter spending rules, that kind of approach is more important than ever.",
      "That's why appointing former Red Bull transfer chief Christopher Vivell as interim director of recruitment in July was a revealing move. Vivell's spell has now been extended until the end of the January window and if both parties remain happy it could become a permanent role.",
      "Vivell, still only 37, made his name within the Red Bull network and many of his transfer successes both for RB Salzburg and RB Leipzig are names now familiar to a global audience. He came in with a reputation for spotting emerging talent and his biggest move in his first summer at Old Trafford was to play a pivotal role in the addition of Sekou Kone for just over £1m.",
      "The Malian's arrival was given a bigger billing than that of other young players to join the club this summer and the 18-year-old isn't being viewed as a signing for the academy. He will require a settling-in period having moved from Guidars FC in Mali and will initially train with the age-group levels, but there is excitement around his arrival.",
      "Those are the kind of deals with which Vivell made his name. He bought Erling Haaland to RB Salzburg from Molde for €2m and offered him a clear development pathway, an opportunity which the Norwegian grasped.",
      "United's new sporting director Dan Ashworth is understood to be an admirer of the Red Bull network and they have certainly developed a reputation as shrewd operators in the transfer market in recent years. Vivell was heavily involved in that, as was United's former caretaker manager Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Rangnick was something of a mentor to Vivell and during his disastrous spell in the United dugout he pushed hard for changes behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Rangnick's more recent background was an executive and he quickly realised United didn't have the structure in place to deliver long-term success.",
      "That has changed rapidly since February. By the end of the January window, and as Ineos approach their one-year anniversary, the structure could be finalised. Ashworth and Vivell will decide if the director of recruitment role is one that should be made permanent and if the German feels the job is right for him.",
      "If he does stay then United will continue to focus their transfer activity on youth, not just on signing players in their early to mid-20s for the first team, but by strengthening the level below that as well. That is where Vivell first forged his reputation. United will never be able to truly ape the Red Bull model. They have grander ambitions than those clubs and at some point that could require more significant investment on a more experienced player or two.",
      "But at a time when financial controls are beginning to bite and every club is being forced to watch the bottom line, it's not a bad starting place.",

      "The former Manchester United midfielder, currently playing for Lille in France, was named in Lee Carsley's squad last week for this month's international break for the first time in his career.",
      "His time in the spotlight has sparked many wondering what happened when he was at United and how the club allowed a player of his talent leave. Here, MEN Sport takes a look at Gomes and his career so far.",
      "Salford-born Gomes started training at the United academy at the age of six before making his debut for the Under-18s at just 14. After signing a scholarship at the club, Gomes became the third youngest United academy player to score three goals at the age of 15 years and 362 days.",
      "His time at the academy was topped when he was named Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year in 2017 before he started training with the first-time. In the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at the end of the 2016/17 campaign, Gomes made his senior debut when he replaced Wayne Rooney.",
      "That game saw him become the youngest player to represent the Red Devils since Duncan Edwards, as well as the first player born in the 2000s to play in the Premier League. His exciting start to life saw him be rewarded with his first professional contract.",
      "In his final seasons at United, under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Gomes was hardly used. The 2018/19 season saw him play just two times for the first-team, followed by only six more games.",
      "He played twice against FC Astana and AZ Alkmaar in the UEFA Europa League and came off the bench against Manchester City in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup.",
      "Since moving to France, Gomes' stock has risen. He has played 118 times for Lille and is a regular in the Ligue 1 side's XI. A loan move in Portugal at Boavista helped him adjust to senior football, where he contributed to 12 goals in 32 games.",
      "\"When I left [United] it was more the idea to better myself as a player and person, being [on] the journey I went through I knew eventually I'd be able to create a pathway to be in this position that I'm in now,\" Gomes recently said.",
      "\"It was difficult leaving the club I was in since six [years old] and heading into the unknown really for me personally. From then it’s been an uphill trajectory, but also with a lot of difficulties and difficult moments going through it, but being in this position now makes it all worth it.”",
      "He added: \"Leaving England gave me a big motivation. There were also players that I played with in France that were going to their national teams. It gave me the motivation to know that just because I’m playing in a different league, I can still get to where I want to get to.",
      "“When I left [United], it was to better myself as a player and as a person through a journey and I knew eventually that I’d be able to create a pathway. It’s been an upwards trajectory [since Boavista], also with a lot of difficult moments. But being in this position now makes everything worth it.”",
      "Gomes' contract at Lille expires at the end of the season and it’s currently understood that he won't extend his stay. He recently admitted that he has had offers from the Premier League before and it's likely that interest will continue to soar.",
      "Asked whether he had already received offers to return to the Premier League, Gomes smiled: “I have … but I believe everything will happen naturally and at its own time and I am really chilled.",

      "United have won five of their last 15 Premier League games and that is the kind of form that gets managers in trouble. This article is not lobbying for a managerial change - Ten Hag must be given time after being financially backed - but the reality is stark improvement is required.",

      "You'll be forgiven for not recognising Christopher Vivell's name. He joined United in July to work as part of the new football structure put in place by Ineos, having previously worked at Chelsea as their technical director, and he joined the recruitment team in Manchester.",

      "Nagelsmann has extended his contract with Germany until the 2026 World Cup but the opportunity to manage United doesn't come around often. It might not even come at all and Ten Hag may succeed in the next stage of his project, but Nagelsmann is someone of interest.",

      "Manchester United made a late enquiry for Michael Olise in the summer transfer window, but he already had his heart set on a £51 million move to Bayern Munich. He completed his move to the German giants early in the transfer window.",
      "That is according to the Daily Mail, who say United made their interest in the France U21 international known and were willing to use Sir Alex Ferguson to try and convince the player to move to Old Trafford. However, they were a bit late with their attempts, with Olise having already made his mind up about a move to Bayern.",
      "The report does, however, add that United will be at the ‘front of the queue’ if he is to ever leave Bayern in the future.",
      "MEN Sport says: It’s a massive advantage having one of the best ever managers in your corner when trying to convince players to sign. It’d be no surprise if United have used the tactic before and continue to do so for years to come.",
      "While United left it late to convince Olise, the fact that they were showing an interest and are reportedly keeping tabs on the player is a good sign. If he was to leave Bayern for one reason or another, it should give United an advantage in any transfer race that could come with that.",
      "Former United captain Roy Keane has told United fans not to write off Casemiro and has suggested a new position for the midfielder. The Brazilian has been linked with a move to Turkey over the last few days but looks set to stay at United until at least January.",
      "It comes after he struggled against Liverpool with two mistakes in the first half leading to both first half goals for Luis Diaz. Casemiro was replaced by youngster Toby Collyer at half time.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: “I wouldn’t be writing him off yet,”",
      "“His role in the team, if he gets back in and a couple of games under his belt, might be a bit higher up the pitch.",
      "“The first thing we always say is, ‘he can’t get around the pitch’. But what we’ve seen going forward, he does have an eye for a pass. Set-pieces, how many times does he get his head on it?”",
      "He added: “He’s come back and he’s lost a lot of weight, sometimes that can affect a player.",
      "“Players becoming fitness freaks... you can go too far the other way. You still need that strength and power in the middle of the park.”",
      "MEN Sport says: Now that Manuel Ugarte is in the building and eligible to play, Casemiro is likely to have to wait for his opportunity again. Playing further forward could be the ideal solution for both the team and the player.",
      "With Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo behind him, Casemiro wouldn’t have to worry about his defensive duties so much. You don’t achieve what he has done in his career without being a skilful player, playing him further up could just allow him to show that without needing the mobility as much as probably is needed further back.",
      "A change in position means that United will have more cover in more areas of the pitch too. It could be win-win for all parties.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has echoed Erik ten Hag by referring to his two trophy triumphs in as many seasons as a sign of progress at Manchester United, while acknowledging there is still room for growth.",
      "The United boss was keen to relay his League Cup and FA Cup successes in defence of his tenure to journalists following Sunday’s 3-0 drubbing by Liverpool, having seen his side lose two of their three opening games this season.",
      "Some United supporters feel unsatisfied by the Dutchman’s two-year reign so far, despite his silverware haul. The club recorded their lowest Premier League finish last season after finishing bottom of their Champions League group and producing a flimsy defence of their League Cup title.",
      "Speaking after the defeat to Liverpool, Ten Hag said: “Listen, we won, the last two years, behind Manchester City, the most trophies in English football, so we performed already the last two seasons.",
      "“And, yes, also this year, we want to win and we want to win trophies. And so I'm quite confident we will build to this. And that is what I did the last 11 years.",
      "“So just be patient, waiting. We will work on the process and we have to improve the process. And we will aim for our next targets and we will go for trophies.”",
      "United were plagued by injury setbacks last season, with Martinez one of those suffering persistent problems. The Argentine only played a total of 14 club matches last term having sustained three separate significant issues.",
      "While speaking to native media outlet La Nacion ahead of Argentina’s World Cup qualifiers this international break, the defender admitting to feeling “insecure” about his constant injuries, outling how such a spate can “destroy your head”.",
      "But the 26-year-old, who says he is \"grateful\" for what he learned through his time out, is nevertheless on board with Ten Hag’s message of progress. Detailing his two years so far at the club, he said: “When I set foot in United's training centre in Carrington, I felt something special.",
      "“‘We're going to win here,’ that's what I felt. Like electricity, a strong energy of glory... something that motivated me a lot. 'This is a place to win,' I told myself.",
      "“Well, we've already won two very important titles in two seasons, but we have to keep growing to reach our goal, which is to become what Manchester has always been, one of the very great teams, one of the best in the world.”",
      "Martinez completed a personal redemption arc when he played 73 minutes of this year’s shock FA Cup win over Manchester City, having been ruled out of the 2023 edition due to injury.",
      "He revealed that the trip to Wembley was one occasion through which he managed to speak with Sir Alex Ferguson, who himself lifted five FA Cups during his reign.",
      "“I have met Ferguson three or four times,” Martinez revealed. “Ferguson is the God of Manchester. He is a person who gave a lot to the club and who continues to give because he remains connected.",
      "“Now, the new owners have also included him. When [Argentina] won the World Cup we spoke a little, he congratulated me. Later, also when we won the Carabao and the FA Cup - he is a legend of world football and I respect people's privacy…",
      "“Of course I would like to be able to talk to him, actually listen to him, but I would not dare to invade his space.”",

Final positions determine which teams play each other in the play-off and last-16 rounds and all the way through to the final.",

A 'level of randomness’ has been thrown in to reflect possible upsets, so that the top seed does not always necessarily win every game.",
      "This process, based on current information available, is done 1,000 times, from which the supercomputer composes a final league table for the initial round of group fixtures.",
      "In said league phase, United are due to face FC Twente at home before Porto and Fenerbahce away ahead of meetings with PAOK and Bodo/Glimt at Old Trafford. United then travel to Viktoria Plzen before facing Rangers at home ahead of a final trip to Steaua Bucharest.",
      "The predicted table shows United - who have confirmed their Europa League squad - finishing seventh and thereby within the top eight teams who automatically advance to the last-16. Lyon are put top with Porto second and Lazio third.",
      "Tottenham have been placed 11th, meaning they would have to go through the two-legged play-off round. Meanwhile, Rangers also are required to move through the play-offs with the supercomputer depicting them as facing Spurs in that round and losing.",

      "The new format has also done away with teams dropping down from the Champions League to the Europa League, meaning that predictions become somewhat simpler - albeit the seeded draw based on final league standing make for many knockout permutations.",

      "Antony, who only scored one Premier League goal last season, only notching a single assist as well from his 29 total appearances and 15 starts, is one of those in need of a change of luck at Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag has only used him once in 2024/25 so far and even that was via a brief cameo off the bench.",
      "With United favouring the development of Alejandro Garnacho and Amad, Antony has dropped down the pecking order and is out of form and favour. Far from being a popular name with supporters, the £85million man was reportedly one of many that United would consider selling.",

      "Submissions to UEFA for squads are limited to 25 players and United have filled their A list, which is why Mainoo and Garnacho have been left off for now. United included 21-year-old goalkeeper Dermot Mee and also named Leny Yoro, 18, and Harry Amass, 17, in the squad.",
      "While a 25-man Premier League squad submission allows clubs to list all under-21s on a B list, under UEFA rules only players that are aged under 21 and have spent two years at the club qualify.

      "He will leave the club at the end of next week (Friday, September 13) and his departure was officially confirmed to staff in an email sent by Ashworth and Brailsford on Wednesday, in which they praised the \"significant contribution\" O'Boyle had made to the football department.",
      "In the email, seen by the Manchester Evening News, Ashworth and Brailsford said: \"In particular, we would like to thank Andy for the help and support he has provided to both of us and the Ineos team during the first few months of our involvement with the club and during our first transfer window.",
      "\"He has also played an important role in the redevelopment of Carrington, and his contribution has been key in planning the world-class training facilities we will have here next season.\"",
      "O'Boyle arrived at United in May 2022, leaving a position as the Premier League's head of elite performance to take up the role as John Murtough's deputy. He had a particular focus on data, sports science, medical and the women's team.",

As the MEN revealed yesterday, interim director of recruitment Christopher Vivell has signed a contract to remain in place until at least February.",
      "O'Boyle's job title meant he was deputy to a position that no longer existed and with the Ineos hires now settled at the club, it has been decided the time is right for O'Boyle to move on. It is understood he will now pursue a leadership role elsewhere in the game.",

Clinton excelled for the latter last term, scoring four goals and assisting four others in 20 Women's Super League (WSL) appearances and playing an integral role in Spurs’ charge to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final, though she was ineligible to play against her parent club and eventual victors United at Wembley.",
      "Her impressive form saw her receive her first senior England call up earlier this year. She made her first full start against Austria after two appearances off the bench, and duly made an impact with her first international goal in a 7-2 win for the Lionesses.",
      "Clinton impressed so much at Tottenham that the club were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" manager Robert Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "However United boss Skinner has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester. \"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" he said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "And Clinton has now voiced her commitment to the Reds, insisting her ambition is to add more silverware to the club's collection. \"To go to Tottenham and get confidence was just amazing,\" she said at the start-studded awards ceremony on Tuesday night. \"And to improve obviously personally. The aim is always to win trophies with Manchester United.\"",
      "On her award, Clinton added: “It’s such an honour to be voted by the unbelievable players that play in this league. It’s the best league in the world. “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognized is lovely. I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player. Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”",
      "Clinton also featured in the PFA Women's Team of the Year, alongside Manchester City stars Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw, Yui Hasegawa, Lauren Hemp, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Laia Aleixandri. She beat out a host of talented players to earn the award with Lauren James, Aggie Beever-Jones, Khiara Keating, Maya Le Tissier and Jess Park among the names on the Top Six shortlist.",

      "With a deft back-post finish, Lizzie Arnot wrote her name into the annals of Manchester United history. The date was August 19, 2018 and the Scotland international ensured the Reds' long-awaited renaissance began in style by netting a last-gasp winner against bitter rivals Liverpool in the League Cup.",
      "The setting - in front of just 829 fans at an overcast Prenton Park - belied the enormity of the occassion. This was United's first competitive game in 13 years, their first competitive outing since the Glazer regime opted to disband their senior women's team after deeming it not to be part of the club's \"core business\".",
      "The team was peppered with familar faces. Alex Greenwood, now captain of Manchester City, teed up Arnot to score the winner. Lauren James, who returned to childhood club Chelsea for what was - in 2021 - a British record fee, started in midfield, while current United stars Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Leah Galton also featured.",
      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",
      "Last term, despite a disappointing fifth-place finish in the WSL, United beat Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup trophy; a reality which would have seemed inconceivable on that momentous afternoon at Prenton Park more than half a decade ago.",
      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",

Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber.
