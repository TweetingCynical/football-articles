      "Manchester United will bid farewell to at least nine players on Monday - with their contracts expiring.",
      "The Red Devils are currently navigating the summer transfer window as they gear up for the 2025/26 Premier League season. Matheus Cunha has already been snapped up by United, and negotiations are underway to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "It's yet to be seen who else United will pursue before the transfer window shuts on 1 September. However, when it comes to departures, at least nine players are certain to leave the club this summer.",
      "United have confirmed that Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will all exit the club when their playing contracts run out on 30 June, although United have now confirmed that Evans has retired from playing and will become the Head of Loans and Pathways for the club's academy.",
      "The trio will depart Old Trafford as free agents and will be eligible to sign with a new club from Tuesday (1 July). Tom Heaton was also potentially leaving United this summer as his original contract was due to expire.",
      "However, earlier this month it was announced that the seasoned goalkeeper has inked a one-year extension to stay at United for another season.",
      "As part of their retained list, United also revealed that six academy stars would be exiting the club. Hubert Graczyk, Jack Kingdon, Sam Murray, Tom Myles, James Nolan and Tom Wooster will all leave when their contracts end by close of play on Monday.",
      "United have also announced that Ashton Missin has been offered a new contract to prolong his tenure at the club. If an agreement isn't reached, the young forward would depart once his existing contract expires.",
      "Meanwhile, Brentford have rejected Manchester United’s latest bid worth up to £62.5million for Mbeumo. United are pushing to bring in the 25-year-old forward, having completed the capture of Matheus Cunha earlier this month.",
      "The Brazil international arrived from Wolves in a £62.5m deal, which is the amount United’s latest offer for Mbeumo came to when add-ons were included.",
      "But Brentford are understood to have rebuffed that approach, just like a previous offer worth up to £55m, and talks continue over a move that the player is understood to have expressed his desire to make.",
      "Spurs, now managed by Mbeumo’s ex-Bees boss Thomas Frank, are also interested in the Cameroon international. The forward’s contract at Brentford expires next summer, although there is an option to extend by a further year.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "While Matheus Cunha has already walked through Manchester United's doors, Bryan Mbeumo could soon follow – and supporters will be hoping to avoid a repeat of past failings in the transfer market.",
      "The Red Devils signed Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £62.5million at the start of June and are trying to wrap up a move for Mbeumo, despite recent interest from Tottenham Hotspur – now managed by his former boss Thomas Frank. Ruben Amorim is desperate for new recruits, after losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "United are always busy in the transfer window, but their success record in recent years has not been strong.",
      "The likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Antony have each arrived for huge money, but have failed to hit the heights they did at their previous clubs. While many United fans will pick holes in various deals that have been made, they will be equally disappointed with the targets who have got away.",
      "In his final season at Tottenham Hotspur, Harry Kane overtook Jimmy Greaves to become Spurs' record goalscorer, before stating Alan Shearer's Premier League record was next in his sights. With Manchester City signing Erling Haaland, Liverpool buying Cody Gakpo at the time and Spurs generally being reluctant to sell star players to Chelsea and Arsenal, United looked to have a clear route to Kane.",
      "However, Benni McCarthy, who was part of Erik ten Hag's backroom team at Old Trafford at the time, revealed the club were put off by his nine-figure transfer fee.",
      "Speaking at Ladbrokes' launch of the Gaffer of all Accas, McCarthy said: \"Harry Kane was Erik's No.1 target. Erik really wanted him. Kolo Muani was also very high on that list. Victor Osimhen was also on that list. But I felt that if you're going to want to spend that kind of money – £100million-plus – then you want the complete package. And Harry Kane, for me, was the complete package.",
      "\"But unfortunately, the club didn't see it that way. They looked at it as Rasmus Hojlund in the long run would be a more prized asset than investing in both Rasmus and Harry Kane. So we stopped pursuing Kane and we ended up getting just Rasmus.\"",
      "Kane left for Bayern Munich that summer, having scored 213 Premier League goals – just 47 short of Shearer's record of 260.",
      "In 2015, Muller was heavily linked with a move to United, who were managed by Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman was one of Muller's first managers at Bayern Munich and a reunion was potentially on the cards.",
      "However, the German international was one of Bayern's most important players. Even a world record equalling £80m bid from United did not budge the Bundesliga heavyweight's resolve.",
      "Looking back on the rumours, Muller has previously said: \"Things were serious when Van Gaal came in [for me] in 2015, for all sides involved. I could imagine going to United then.",
      "\"But the club said, 'We want you to stay.’ I wasn’t out of contract, that’s why it was pretty clear-cut in the end.”",
      "Very briefly, Declan Rice was the most expensive transfer in Premier League history when he decided to join Arsenal in 2023. Before he moved to the Emirates Stadium, United were constantly linked with him.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously revealed that he and other officials at the Red Devils discussed a move for the ex-West Ham United captain.",
      "The Norwegian previously told The Stick to Football podcast: \"We discussed him a few times and I think we would have done well with him in midfield.",
      "\"I think he improved a lot on his playmaking as well. Obviously he would have cost some money, but we could have and should have gone for him.”",
      "United had inside-knowledge of Erling Haaland when the forward was still a little known teenager in Norway. That came courtesy of Solskjaer, who was managing Molde when Haaland was a barely known young prodigy.",
      "Before he even returned to Old Trafford, Solskjaer told his former side to snap him up as soon as possible. The ex-United boss said: \"I had him in Molde, for two seasons more or less. The summer before I got here [in Manchester], I rang the club and said, 'You’ve got to sign this boy. He’ll be absolutely top class.'",
      "\"That was June, July 2018, and they said, 'No.' Then I became caretaker manager and Molde had sold Haaland to RB Salzburg. I told the club, 'Buy him straightaway, before he plays,' because he didn't play for them for three or four months. 'Just sign him now because he's got a release clause.'",
      "\"We knew that then, and no-one else would’ve paid that money – €20m (£17.2m) it would’ve been a bargain. It was the club’s decision to not go for him then. We never made bids or went in for him, until after they realised, when he started scoring for Salzburg. By then Dortmund were there, Juventus were there, everyone was there.”",
      "After a disappointing first transfer window as United manager, David Moyes started looking towards the future, where he envisioned a starting eleven with Toni Kroos in the midfield. Moyes missed out on many top targets in his first summer, including the likes of Gareth Bale, Cesc Fabregas and Arturo Vidal, and had to settle with just Marouane Fellaini arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "In 2014, Moyes started a charm offensive with Kroos, that worked, as they agreed a verbal agreement for him to join. Kroos said: \"I knew that Manchester United wanted me and Moyes underlined that absolutely. It was a really nice afternoon with very nice people. We talked a lot about United’s footballing plan which convinced me. In the end, we agreed verbally. So it was close, I almost went to United.\"",
      "Unfortunately for Moyes, he would go on to be sacked before the end of his first campaign. His successor, Van Gaal, opted against signing Kroos and instead bought Ander Herrera to strengthen their midfield.",

      "The Bradford-born forward joined the Red Devils' academy at the tender age of six and made his first-team debut under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019, soon becoming the club's youngest European goalscorer at just 17.",
      "In October 2022, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and controlling and coercive behaviour. These charges were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service a year later.",
      "Following his arrest, Greenwood was suspended by United and loaned out to Spanish side Getafe. In July of 2024, he left Old Trafford for good, signing for Ligue 1 side Marseille in a deal worth £26.6million.",
      "Pictures on Instagram show Greenwood taking part in sprints and shooting drills on Chadderton's new 3G pitch, alongside former United team-mate D'Mani Mellor.",
      "Mellor and Greenwood once shared the pitch during a shocking 2-1 loss to Astana in the Europa League back in 2019. The United youngsters had taken an early lead through Jesse Lingard, only to be shocked by a second-half revival from the Kazakhstani side, cemented by an own goal from Di'Shon Bernard.",
      "The 24-year-old experienced a series of loan moves before a permanent switch to Wycombe Wanderers in 2022. He is now starring for Macclesfield and was spotted training with Greenwood once again earlier this month, this time at a Manchester-based facility.",
      "As for Greenwood, his first campaign with Marseille was an incredibly successful one, as he tied with Ballon d'Or hopeful and Champions League winner Ousmane Dembele atop the Ligue 1 goal-scoring charts with 21.",
      "This prolific strike rate helped his team secure a second-placed finish, earning them a berth in next season's Champions League. They'll also be welcoming former United hopeful Angel Gomes into their ranks.",

      "But, while highlighting his work before pre-season is underway, Fofana has issued an update that sees him in United colours. Posting on his Instagram, the 20-year-old winger has uploaded photographs of him training wearing United's third kit from 2022/23.",
      "The luminous green shirt displays Marcus Rashford's name and number on the back. Though any prospect of Fofana playing alongside the England international appears unlikely with Rashord expected to depart this summer.",
      "Reports in France suggest Fofana's future could lie elsewhere before Lyon return to training on July 7. The Belgian is said to be valued higher than Rayan Cherki, who joined Manchester City for £34million, and Chelsea have already made contract with the French club.",
      "An exit for Fofana could now be more likely after Lyon were relegated Ligue 2 on after failing to provide financial guarantees to the game's watchdog. The ex-Gent ace scored five goals and provided four assists in 29 games in Ligue 1 and made his Belgium debut in November.",
      "Ahead of this summer, Fofana changed his representatives, signing with Roc Nation Sports. But his former agency, BF SportsPartner, have previously claimed that a move to Liverpool would be Fofana's dream. They told Africafoot earlier this year: \"The choice of heart would be Liverpool.",
      "\"He has the potential to enter the rotation, and above all, we would like to see him succeed African legends such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and El-Hadji Diouf. He has the profile to succeed in the Premier League.",

      "The 27-year-old, who first made his name with the Red Devils under Louis van Gaal, last played for Bayer Leverkusen in April 2023 before leaving the club the following year having failed to make an appearance in their title-winning season under Xabi Alonso. And following that Fosu-Mensah has spent 12 months as a free agent and learned about a new aspect of the footballing world.",
      "The defender has experienced plenty of difficulties in his career. The Dutchman has been impacted by managerial changes — Van Gaal was replaced by Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford who spoke of 'great potential” and promised 'plenty of opportunities' before offering just one Premier League start in a season — seen a loan opportunity end via a horrific cruciate ligament injury and most recently failed to find a club after being shown the door by Leverkusen.",

While injury limited his game time during his debut campaign, the versatile centre midfielder has made 39 appearances this season and impressed for Dortmund at the Club World Cup, which could prompt a return to the Premier League.",

However, Nmecha eventually swapped England for Germany at both club and international level, having previously represented the Three Lions’ age-group sides.",
      "Caught Offside has reported that United are interested in bringing Nmecha to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to rebuild his team. Dortmund are on the verge of selling Jamie Gittens to Chelsea but are said to be unwilling to cash in on Nmecha.",
      "Whether Nmecha does complete a move to Old Trafford remains to be seen, but Guardiola was aware of the player’s potential before he left City in 2021. After a win over Oxford United in the Carabao Cup, Guardiola name-checked Nmecha as one of three players to watch out for, despite not handing the then-17-year-old his debut.",

      "However, it took Nmecha little time to prove himself after leaving City and reuniting with his brother Lukas at Werder Bremen. In January 2022, Sport Bible reported that England were at risk of losing Nmecha, who had played for the Three Lions from U16 to U19 level.",
      "The midfielder was said to be in talks with the German federation over declaring for the country. His older brother Lukas had made the same switch after playing for England U21s. The warning proved to be prescient for Gareth Southgate, who had also failed to convince Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala to continue representing England a year earlier.",

      "He scored 19 goals and added three assists in 32 Serie A games last season as the Florence club secured a European place. They are hopeful of retaining Kean but the Italian has a release clause, but it is only active in the first two weeks of July, reports Corriere dello Sport.",

      "He's since rebuilt his reputation with PSG and then back in Italy.

He was keen on Liam Delap before he headed to Chelsea.",

At the centre of the dispute is an apparent gentleman's agreement, made between Gyokeres and the club hierarchy, that he would be allowed to leave for less than his official release clause.",
      "Gyokeres has made it clear that this summer is his time to leave Lisbon in search of new opportunities and a higher level of football. He plundered 53 goals and 13 assists in 51 games across the 2024/25 season, helping Sporting win the league and cup double, and feels he should be afforded some good will.",

However, the Gunners, who are desperate to land a top-class number nine this summer, may feel compelled to focus on another target, which would be excellent news for United.",

      "Manchester United's hopes that Inter Milan would follow up their enquiry with a bid for misfiring £72million striker Rasmus Hojlund have taken a huge hit. Inter targeted two new strikers after finishing second in Serie A and then being hammered by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League Final.",
      "But they have spent £20m on Parma's Ange-Yoan Bonny and are ready to give teenager Francesco Pio Esposito more game-time. He capped a fine performance against River Plate in the Club World Cup with his first goal for them.",
      "That would close the door on a permanent move for Denmark international Hojlund, although Inter could still offer a 12-month loan option with an obligation to buy. United are willing to listen to offers for every member of their squad this summer after their disastrous season.",
      "The 22-year-old has also been linked with a move to Napoli, although their first-choice target is Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez. Hojlund expects to start the season with United, having been asked about his future during the June international window.",
      "\"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United,\" he told Danish broadcaster TV2. \"I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.\"",
      "\"I know I can't get much out of reading things. I know what the facts are, and that is that I have a contract with Manchester United until 2030. I expect to play there, so I'm just getting ready for some summer vacation and then hopefully a good pre-season.\"",
      "Hojlund also enjoys working with Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim, as he declared in March: \"I'm focused on the task with Ruben because that project is incredibly exciting.",
      "\"Erik [ten Hag] was of course one of the reasons why I moved to Manchester United. He was doing something good and was a talented coach, but it didn't work out, and that's how it is.",
      "\"I'm still very happy to be at Manchester United. It's the club I've always dreamed of playing for. And I'm really happy for Ruben. He's a cool character and a cool person.\"",
      "Amorim has also suggested that we're yet to see the best of the Dane, saying last month: \"I'm happy. Of course all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels. But he is improving. I'm really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\""

      "Former Manchester United star Paul Pogba broke down in tears after signing a contract with Monaco, ending his two-year absence from football. Pogba, 32, last played a competitive match for Juventus in September 2023, the start date of an 18-month ban for a doping offence which the Court of Arbitration for Sport accepted was 'not intentional'.",
      "The midfielder was initially given a four-year suspension which was later reduced upon appeal, allowing him to return to football in March of this year. Last November, Juventus and Pogba mutually agreed to terminate his contract which ran until 2026.",
      "After eight months without a club, the Frenchman has finally found a new employer after being linked with moves to the Saudi Pro League and Major League Soccer. Pogba has joined Monaco on a two-year deal and is set to wear the No.8 shirt.",
      "The 32-year-old will play in Ligue 1 for the first time in his career, having come through the ranks at United before moving to Juventus in 2012. Pogba returned to Old Trafford for £89million four years later before making the same move back to Turin.",
      "Monaco marks a fresh start for the 91-time France international, who hopes to represent his country at the World Cup next summer. Announcing his arrival on Saturday, Monaco released a video of Pogba visibly overcome with emotion as he signed the paperwork.",
      "A tear dropped down on the contract, as Pogba wiped his eyes and thanked those involved in the transfer for their 'trust'. In the replies section, United legend Rio Ferdinand posted: \"Real,\" with a red heart emoji.",
      "Pogba is yet to give an interview to club media, although the the ex-Red Devils star spoke to French broadcaster TF1 ahead of his move to the Principality.",
      "\"I'm mentally and physically ready, and I'm eager to start again,\" Pogba declared. \"In fact, despite my age, I'm like a kid. I still like playing with the ball, dribbling.",
      "Will Paul Pogba be a success at Monaco? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"I've become that kid again that I was at Roissy-en-Brie, who wants to start his career. I think about it, I wonder how it's going to go, like a young person entering the training centre for the first time. Everything will depend on me.\"",
      "Pogba also criticised Juventus for not helping him maintain his fitness while he was still under contract with the Italian giants. \"At the time, I asked for help, for example, treatment or a physical trainer, because I was still part of Juventus,\" he explained.",
      "\"But I didn't even get that. They weren't really with me. And feeling that, it hit me hard. I didn't understand, I wasn't at war with them.\""

      "The academy star is back in Manchester after his loan spell with Aston Villa came to an end. At Villa Park, Rashford looked back to his best, but the Midlands club have not exercised their option to buy him permanently and it looks unlikely that he'll forge a way back into the United first-team.",
      "Rashford has been linked with a move to Barcelona and a switch to the Nou Camp would be his dream move, but the Catalans are going after Nico Williams which could curtail that move.",
      "The United star, when he's on it, has been a deadly individual, scoring 30 times in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge. Since then though he's struggled to hit those heights with his body language and attitude question. Rashford made his Premier League debut in 2016 alongside Fosu-Mensah and the defender just wants to see his former colleague enjoying his football.",
      "He told the Independent: “I just want him to be happy. Everybody just wants him to be happy. The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he’s a top player.”",
      "Rashford's demise has coincided with Ruben Amorim's arrival. It quickly became apparent that the Portuguese coach didn't fancy the forward and he was left out of a number of matchday squads before sealing an exit in the New Year.",
      "Amorim continued to hint at an attitude problem as he said: \"In January we lost Rashford and Antony and we didn’t bring new ones – was a risk. But there are things here that are more important than to score 10 more goals this season. We are trying to do something that is more important. We can hurt the squad now, but in the future it is going to help the club. So we are on that path.”",
      "The United boss wasn't shy in suggesting that Rashford's efforts in training were a major reason for his omission. He once claimed that he would rather pick his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach in his squad rather than Rashford.",
      "He said: \"If things don't change, I will not change. It's the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player. You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [ Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\"",

      "Over the weekend, a new option to improve United's attack was made available when Dominic Calvert-Lewin announced that he would be leaving Everton on a free transfer. Unsurprisingly, he was linked to Old Trafford almost immediately.",
      "Elsewhere, the links to Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez continue to be strong with the goalkeeper reportedly favouring a switch to United. If he were to move to Manchester, Andre Onana's future would be in doubt as the club's No.1.",

      "However, Osimhen rejected this deal and, with July around the corner, he is no closer to securing an exit. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Serie A champions will invite the 26-year-old to a medical on either July 14 or 15 ahead of pre-season.",
      "It is not yet clear if Osimhen will accept this invitation but it is seen as being in both parties' interests for him to attend.

      "We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million (£55.5m). I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million (£64m). Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.",
      "Speaking during the last England camp where Toney was recalled for the first time since his move to Al Ahli, the former Brentford striker insisted that he was never worried about receiving a call-up back to the national team ahead of the World Cup.",

I think it's been proven me being me being back here and being back amongst the boys. It feels good to see the faces again and it feels good to get stuck in.",
      "According to reports in Spain, United are ready to make an offer for former Brentford striker Ivan Toney which would see him return to the Premier League.",
      "The 29-year-old scored 30 goals for Al Ahli this season and this is believed to have caught the eye of United.",
      "It is claimed that United are willing to make a £29.9m offer to bring Toney to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "With Arsenal seemingly switching their focus to Ekitike, United could be able to move in for Gyokeres this summer.",
      "It is widely believed that Gyokeres is looking to go on strike to force a move from Sporting.",

      "It is claimed that Ekitike is a serious option at the Emirates Stadium should they miss out on the signature of either Gyokeres or Sesko this summer.",
      "His asking price could be a dealbreaker for the Gunners though with Eintracht currently insisting on £85m.",
      "On paper, Calvert-Lewin is the type of striker that Amorim will want.",
      "At his best, he is quick, aggressive and can hold the ball up in the offensive third. However, his stats last season make him a huge gamble.",
      "While a lot of his campaign was disrupted due to a hamstring injury, Calvert-Lewin scored just three Premier League goals before his enforced break.",
      "The season before that, he only managed eight goals in all competitions and he has not hit double figures since his impressive 2020/21 Covid hit campaign which saw him bag 16 goals in 33 Premier League games.",
      "He is hardly, at this stage, the prolific goalscorer that Amorim is looking for and at 28, you fear he may not have the years left to reach those previous peaks.",
      "Currently, it appears that Calvert-Lewin could affectively move to any club in this summer transfer window.",
      "Bookmakers bet365 are not committing firmly to any given club with any great strength but United are listed as joint favourites alongside Newcastle at 6/1.",
      "This weekend, Calvert-Lewin confirmed that he would be leaving Everton at the expiry of his contract.",
      "In his statement, the striker refused to acknowledge where he will be moving next but did suggest he was eager for a new challenge.",
      "The choice to move on was not simply about me - it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together. We believe it is the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn’t lessen the bond I’ll always have with Everton.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this Monday morning.",

      "Temperatures are not the only thing expected to heat up today with the summer transfer window likely to kick up a notch with July just around the corner.",
      "To kick things off, we will be looking at this man and the likelihood of him moving to Old Trafford...",
      "Ben Jacobs has reported that Neom SC are close to finalising a deal for Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka.",
      "He adds that the Saudi Arabian club are on the verge of completing the move amid links with Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana.",
      "The reporter claims that the United shot-stopper was never a target despite reports.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Viktor Gyokeres has no intention of returning to play for Sporting CP.",
      "The saga unravelling in Lisbon appears to have turned bitter with the Sweden international now, seemingly, forcing his way out.",
      "Man United are among the clubs interested, according to reports, but Arsenal and other top European clubs are also in the hunt.",
      "Gyokeres, it has been said, has been left feeling betrayed and tired by his treatment.",
      "According to a report from Nathan Salt, reiterated by Fabrizio Romano, Man United prospect JJ Gabriel is set to sign a new contract.",
      "It has been said that clubs from across several top European clubs had expressed an interest.",
      "Jason Wilcox reportedly intervened at a crucial period and the deal is in its final stages.",
      "Reports in Italy suggest that Dusan Vlahovic has no plans to leave Juventus this summer.",
      "It has been claimed that Man United are targeting the Serbian, who joined the Serie A giants for £62million three years ago, is into the last year of his contract in Turin.",
      "The suggestion is that Ruben Amorim has him on his list of targets.",
      "But La Gazzetta dello Sport has rejected the claim that Juventus could be willing to cash in on the powerhouse or tie him down to a new deal on lesser terms.",
      "Football finance expert Stefan Borson believes Antony's future could cause a problem for Manchester United.",
      "Reports suggest that the Brazilian is giving priority to Real Betis after a successful loan, following reports that Como tried to sign the attacker.",
      "Borson told Football Insider:",
      "“It’s a big problem for them if it’s true he only wants to join Betis.",
      "“I suspect it’s not true. I suspect the reality is that there’s just not that much interest.",
      "“The problem that Manchester United have got with the interest only being from them is that they simply are not going to have the money to pay anywhere near what United need even to break even on the deal.",
      "“They might be able to pay his wages. Apparently, he’s on reasonable wages, although I find that slightly hard to believe as well.",
      "“But let’s assume that’s true and he’s on okay wages that they can just about handle.",
      "“It still doesn’t deal with the fact that they’ve got this problem on what they could afford.”",
      "Frederico Varandas has confirmed there is a strong possibility that Viktor Gyokeres will leave the club this summer.",
      "The Sporting CP president has undoubtedly put clubs on red-alert with the Sweden international attracting clubs from across Europe.",
      "Manchester United were among those interested but reports recently suggested that Gyokeres had turned down a reunion with Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres,\" he told A Bola.",
      "\"We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor's dreams.",
      "\"Sporting has a commitment, made by the president, not to ask for the value of the termination clause and to be reasonable in relation to Viktor 's performance last season.",
      "\"If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. In the last few weeks, we have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65million.",
      "\"I saw two players being sold in the Premier League, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70million.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26-years-old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor's value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "\"I won't say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60m plus €10m. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm, because there are only two scenarios.",
      "\"One club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dreams, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.",
      "\"I have been in football for 20 years and have already experienced countless transfer dramas. The transfer window is a cure for any ill. Disgruntled players are not a problem. Viktor staying will not be a problem for us, it will be a problem for our opponents.\"",
      "Man United are the favourites to sign Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, according to bet365.",
      "The forward confirmed on Sunday that he would be departing the Toffees when his contract expires at the end of the month. United are 5/1 to sign the striker, slightly above Newcastle at 6/1.",
      "Check the odds here!",
      "18+ only. Please gamble responsibly.",
      "Man United are reportedly keeping an eye on OGC Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, the French side want just €25m for the Poland international. Nice are obviously owned by Ineos alongside United.",
      "Leeds and Sunderland have also been linked with the goalkeeper with Galatasaray and AS Monaco also keen.",
      "Man United are reportedly open to letting Andre Onana leave the club on loan this season.",
      "Onana was signed for over £47million in 2023 under Erik ten Hag to replace David de Gea. The Cameroonian international has endured a mixed first two years at United with some high-profile errors hindering his reputation.",
      "The Sun are reporting that United are now open to sanctioning a loan move for Onana due to his high wages making a permanent exit tricky to construct. The report adds that United are now awaiting approaches for the goalkeeper and would prefer to send Onana to Europe.",
      "Chelsea are reported to have entered the race to sign Manchester United-linked Emi Martinez.",
      "Speculation around the Aston Villa goalkeeper and his future remains at fever pitch this summer. Several reports have underlined Martinez, 32, as a potential replacement for Andre Onana.",

      "Timothy Fosu-Mensah, the ex-Manchester United defender, is optimistic about his future in football, insisting that his dedication \"won't go unnoticed\" as he seeks a new club after two years away from competitive play.",
      "The Ajax academy graduate made a name for himself at Old Trafford, where he rose through the ranks to make 30 appearances for the senior team, a number that could have been greater if not for loan spells and injuries.",
      "Fosu-Mensah's career was hampered by an anterior cruciate ligament injury while on loan at Fulham in 2019, followed by another setback in February 2021 during his time with Bayer Leverkusen, limiting him to just seven league outings.",
      "Now recovered from those setbacks, the 27-year-old is eager to reignite his career following a season without a club.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "\"Last season was the first time in my career that I've spent without a team,\" Fosu-Mensah shared with PA.",
      "\"At this age it's quite early and I think quite strange for people. I know I've been working hard and hard work won't go unnoticed. That's what I believe.",
      "\"If you stay at home, you do nothing and then you think 'boom, OK, I'm going to go this club or that club', no, that's not how it works, that's not my mentality. It's definitely a fresh start and I've been working hard.\"",
      "Despite his last competitive match being in April 2023, Fosu-Mensah is confident he won't find it difficult to return to the game, citing his fitness routine and the examples of others who have come back from various absences.",
      "After departing Bayer without making an appearance during their triumphant 2023-24 season, Fosu-Mensah has spoken about feeling as robust as ever, both mentally and physically.",
      "Despite being on the bench several times and fit for nearly the entire campaign, he faced more unsettling issues following his release last summer.",
      "\"There was a couple of situations with agents here and there, which was a bit of a mess,\" he disclosed. \"People were speaking on my name who I never even had contact with.",
      "\"I would say like 80 per cent of the agents who were approaching clubs and people I didn't even know, who I didn't even had contact with. I think that was a big mess.\"",
      "He acknowledged discussions about a potential move to the Championship during the winter – \"some of them I was aware of, some of them I wasn't,\".",
      "His subsequent five months with Ajax proved advantageous, where he trained with both the reserves and first team, participating in behind-closed-doors matches, and continued with daily summer workouts in pursuit of a comeback.",
      "Speaking from his home in the Netherlands after one such training session, alongside Brian Brobbey and Steven Bergwijn, Fosu-Mensah expressed his enduring affection for Manchester United.",
      "\"I'll always be a fan of United,\" he affirmed. \"Always. I came there when I was 16, I left when I was 23. I've had many nice moments, won a couple of trophies, especially in my first season.",
      "\"We all know United, we all know the history of United, we all know what United stands for.",
      "\"Even this last season the Premier League was difficult for them but they reached the Europa League final, so it's something in the DNA of the club that they always want to win trophies.",
      "\"I have analysed the manager (Ruben Amorim) and I have seen a little bit how he plays and what he wants from his players.",
      "\"Jeremiah St Juste from Sporting Lisbon is a good friend of mine and he had great words for the manager, so I'm positive that United brought in a good manager.\"",
      "Fosu-Mensah is hopeful that \"good things will happen to the club and to the players\" next season, including Marcus Rashford who made his Premier League debut alongside him against Arsenal in February 2016.",
      "\"I just want him to be happy,\" he added. \"Everybody just wants him to be happy.",
      "\"The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he's a top player.\""

      "Darren Fletcher is in talks to become Manchester United's new Under-18 manager.",
      "Fletcher is currently a first-team coach within Ruben Amorim's backroom staff. The former midfielder has been regarded as an important conduit between the academy and the senior squad due to his knowledge of the academy, so United believe Fletcher would be a strong fit for the U18 job.",
      "The 41-year-old wants to explore a career in management. Fletcher was previously reluctant to take an academy role due to his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, being in the system, but they have now progressed as players.",
      "Fletcher initially returned to Old Trafford in 2020 to take up a minor academy role, and he was appointed as the club's inaugural technical director in March 2021 before being relocated following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment.",
      "After Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake, he hired Jason Wilcox as technical director - Wilcox was recently promoted to director of football - and Fletcher became a first-team coach.",
      "Lawrence's departure was unrelated to the club-wide redundancies, and he said that it was a \"privilege\" to work for United when he released a statement confirming his exit.",
      "Lawrence oversaw a treble with the U18s in 2023/2024, winning two trophies at the expense of rivals Man City, and he targeted winning the prestigious FA Youth Cup last season.",
      "However, the U18s were knocked out by Aston Villa at Villa Park on penalties in the Youth Cup semi-finals at the end of March. Villa went on to win the competition against Manchester City.",

      "Matheus Cunha has already made his way to Manchester United, while Bryan Mbeumo could be next in line to join – and fans are hoping further key targets don't slip away as the summer progresses.",
      "The Red Devils secured Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £62.5million at the beginning of June and are now attempting to finalise a deal for Mbeumo, despite recent interest from his former boss Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur. Ruben Amorim is eager for fresh talent, following a Europa League final loss and a 15th place finish in the Premier League.",
      "United are always active in the transfer window, but their track record in recent years leaves much to be desired. High-profile signings such as Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Antony have all come with hefty price tags, but have failed to replicate their form from their previous clubs.",
      "In 2015, Thomas Muller was heavily linked with a move to United when Louis van Gaal was in charge. Van Gaal was one of Muller's earliest managers at Bayern Munich and was reportedly keen on a reunion.",
      "Despite the strong connection, Muller remained a key player for Bayern. Even an £80m bid from United, which would have equalled the world record at the time, couldn't tempt the German giants to sell.",
      "Reflecting on those transfer speculations, Muller has previously said: \"Things were serious when Van Gaal came in [for me] in 2015, for all sides involved. I could imagine going to United then. But the club said, 'We want you to stay.' I wasn't out of contract, that's why it was pretty clear-cut in the end.\"",
      "In his final season with Tottenham, Harry Kane surpassed Jimmy Greaves to become Spurs' all-time top goalscorer and then set his sights on Alan Shearer's Premier League record. With Manchester City securing Erling Haaland, Liverpool opting for Cody Gakpo at that time and Spurs' usual reluctance to sell key players to London rivals like Chelsea and Arsenal, it seemed United had an open path to Kane.",
      "Yet Benni McCarthy, who was a member of Erik ten Hag's coaching staff at Old Trafford then, said the club were spooked by his high transfer fee. At the unveiling of Ladbrokes' Gaffer of all Accas, McCarthy said: \"Harry Kane was Erik's No.1 target. Erik really wanted him.",
      "\"Kolo Muani was also very high on that list. Victor Osimhen was also on that list. But I felt that if you're going to want to spend that kind of money – £100million-plus – then you want the complete package. And Harry Kane, for me, was the complete package.",
      "\"But unfortunately, the club didn't see it that way. They looked at it as Rasmus Hojlund in the long run would be a more prized asset than investing in both Rasmus and Harry Kane. So we stopped pursuing Kane and we ended up getting just Rasmus.\"",
      "Kane subsequently transferred to Bayern Munich that summer, leaving behind a legacy of 213 Premier League goals – merely 47 shy of Shearer’s remarkable 260-goal tally.",
      "For a brief moment, Declan Rice became the most expensive transfer in Premier League history when he signed for Arsenal in 2023. Prior to his move to the Emirates Stadium, United had been consistently linked with the former West Ham United captain.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has openly discussed United's interest in Rice, when he spoke to the Stick to Football podcast. He said: \"We discussed him a few times and I think we would have done well with him in midfield.",
      "\"I think he improved a lot on his playmaking as well. Obviously he would have cost some money, but we could have and should have gone for him.\"",
      "United had an early tip-off about Erling Haaland when the striker was still an emerging talent in Norway. Solskjaer told United scouts about him when he was still managing Molde.",
      "The former United manager said: \"I had him in Molde, for two seasons more or less. The summer before I got here [in Manchester], I rang the club and said, 'You've got to sign this boy. He'll be absolutely top class.'",
      "\"That was June, July 2018, and they said, 'No.' Then I became caretaker manager and Molde had sold Haaland to RB Salzburg. I told the club, 'Buy him straightaway, before he plays,' because he didn't play for them for three or four months. 'Just sign him now because he's got a release clause.'",
      "\"We knew that then and no-one else would've paid that money – €20m (£17.2m) it would've been a bargain. It was the club's decision to not go for him then. We never made bids or went in for him, until after they realised, when he started scoring for Salzburg. By then Dortmund were there, Juventus were there, everyone was there.\"",
      "Following a less than stellar first transfer window as United manager, David Moyes began to plan for the future, envisioning Toni Kroos as part of his starting XI. Moyes' initial summer in charge saw him miss out on several high-profile targets such as Gareth Bale, Cesc Fabregas and Arturo Vidal, with Marouane Fellaini being the only notable arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "In 2014, Moyes initiated a persuasive campaign to secure Kroos, which proved successful as they reached a verbal agreement for the player's transfer. Kroos said: \"I knew that Manchester United wanted me and Moyes underlined that absolutely. It was a really nice afternoon with very nice people. We talked a lot about United's footballing plan which convinced me. In the end, we agreed verbally. So it was close, I almost went to United.\"",
      "Regrettably for Moyes, he was dismissed before the conclusion of his inaugural season. His successor, Van Gaal, chose not to pursue Kroos and instead brought in Ander Herrera to bolster the midfield.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Manchester United will be unable to replace Andre Onana with OGC Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka this summer due to an agreement with UEFA.",
      "United are understood to be in the market for a new number one this summer after Onana's second year at the club ended with serious doubts over his position. Ruben Amorim is said to want a new goalkeeper that fits his system but the position isn't one of priority for the Reds at the moment.",
      "Onana is keen to remain at United and turn things around but the Cameroon international is running out of time to convince senior figures inside the club that he should be the first choice. Reports over the weekend claimed that the possibility of a loan move was now being considered by United to clear the path for a new goalkeeper to be signed.",
      "Emiliano Martinez and Diogo Costa have both been tentatively linked with moves to Old Trafford but Nice's Marcin Bulka has emerged as another candidate to replace Onana. CaughtOffside have reported that sources have stated that United have been keeping a close eye on the Poland international.",
      "Bulka, who has been linked with a return to Chelsea, produced a number of fine performances in France last season and is expected to leave this window. However, he won't be going to United.",
      "Last summer, United and Nice, both owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos, were banned from signing players from each other as part of their negotiations with UEFA. The two teams were forced to seek clarity from the governing body 12 months ago when they both qualified for the 2024/25 Europa League.",
      "As part of the agreement, United were allowed to play in the European competition alongside their sister club but had to agree not to 'transfer players to each other' until September 2025. A statement from UEFA read: \"Furthermore, as additional evidence of their independence, the concerned clubs committed to the following.",
      "\"The clubs will not transfer players to each other, whether Post permanently or on loan, directly or indirectly, from July 2024 to September 2025, with the exception of pre-existing transfer agreements that had been entered into before the opening of the CFCB proceedings;",
      "\"The clubs will not conclude any kind of cooperation, joint technical or commercial agreements between each other; and the clubs will not use any joint scouting or player database.\"",
      "United previously had been keen on Jean-Clair Todibo but the defender joined West Ham. Ratcliffe revealed in an interview with Bloomberg that United had been blocked from signing a player, suspected to be the French centre-back.",
      "Bulka is reportedly also being lined-up for a move to Saudi Arabia side Neom SC. The Saudi Pro League newly-promoted side have already signed Alexandre Lacazette and are reportedly in pole position to sign Bulka."

      "As temperatures soar across Greater Manchester, Manchester United's current squad are preparing to return from all corners of the globe for pre-season.",
      "Tuesday marks the start of July and a month which brings plenty of excitement for supporters. Due to the Premier League season beginning in mid-August, United will play their first pre-season fixture against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19.",
      "Before they step out onto the pitch in Sweden in just over two weeks' time, United will be hopeful of completing some important business. Fortunately, the beginning of July also means that free agents will leave their current clubs and will be available to make moves elsewhere.",
      "One of those set to see their current contract expire on July 1 is Jonathan David. The Canada international has already confirmed that he will be leaving Lille for a new challenge this summer and at 25, he will be seen as a viable option for many clubs.",
      "United have been linked with David previously and his 25 goals this season, including seven in ten during the Champions League, will appeal to the Reds. His next club is not currently confirmed although Juventus are thought to be pushing hard for his signature.",
      "Over the weekend, reports in Italy suggested that David's agents were pushing for £13m in the deal which is thought to be difficult for the Turin club to sanction. So, with that uncertainty ever-present, United could look to jump in and snap up a talent who is worth a gamble.",
      "The other problem which is perhaps not a priority right now, but could soon become one, is in left wing-back. Patrick Dorgu was signed in January and has done well considering the difficult circumstances he found the club in.",
      "However, there is a lack of support around him to enjoy greater squad depth. Question marks still remain surrounding Luke Shaw's fitness but, even at 100 per cent, it is unclear whether he fits that role perfectly.",
      "Therefore, a good addition could be Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell. The full-back was considered an option for United in January and on a free, he would be an even better addition.",
      "He will be a free agent on Tuesday too unless something changes. Unusually, there has been little talk surrounding his future online albeit there is a push from Fenerbahce fans for their team to snap him up.",
      "That being said, even the lure of working under Jose Mourinho would not be enough to stop United signing the 25-year-old if they want him. With money tight and players needing to be sold, concluding deals for the likes of David and Mitchell could ease tensions for United fans with the pre-season schedule looming large."

      "United were handed a tough start to the new campaign with title challengers Arsenal visiting Old Trafford on Sunday August 17. Improving on last year's 15th-place finish is a matter of urgency for everyone connected at United and Amorim has already been handed the tools to do.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been signed from Wolves for £62.5million and Bryan Mbeumo is expected to follow him through the door at Carrington for slightly more. It's understood that more players are likely to be signed before the transfer window closes, although there is a desperate need to sell players.",
      "Excitement is building around how United will line-up against the Gunners in August. Here, MEN Sport has taken a look at how the Reds could line up to take on Mikel Arteta's men in a best-case scenario.",
      "Goalkeeper - Lucas Chevalier",
      "Previously, there was an expectation that Andre Onana would leave United unless something drastically happened. That drastic trigger may have finally landed with reports stating United are open to loaning him out to make room for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Emiliano Martinez and Diogo Costa have both been mentioned but Lille's Lucas Chevalier is available and a financial option. Aston Villa have been tipped to make a move but United could improve their goalkeeper with the £40m arrival.",
      "Defenders - Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui",

      "Wing-backs - Amad, Diogo Dalot",
      "United are also well-stocked in wing-back. While there's the option to play Mazraoui at right wing-back, that place falls to Amad. The signings of Mbuemo and Cunha make it difficult for him to demand a place in attacking midfield and the Ivory Coast international is capable of playing as an attacking wing-back.",
      "On the left, Patrick Dorgu has six months of English football under his belt and Diogo Dalot's is relied heavily on by Amorim. It would be a fight between those two to start.",
      "Midfielders - Bruno Fernandes, Felix Nmecha",
      "Fernandes starts every game he is available for, there's no doubt about that. The United captain will take up a deeper No.8 role next season with a constant eye of being a creative threat behind the front three.",

      "Talking about goals, not many players can boast a record in front of goal like Gyokeres. Since moving to Sporting CP, the striker has scored 97 times in 102 appearances. Them numbers are sensational, even if you don't like the fact that it's in the Portugal top-flight, you can't not want that at Old Trafford.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "The Red Devils had been hoping to swiftly finalise a deal for Mbeumo, who could join Matheus Cunha in joining the Premier League giants in a transfer that would take their summer spend past £120m.",
      "Man Utd have faced competition from rivals for Mbeumo in the race to sign Mbeumo as Thomas Frank’s Tottenham Hotspur have plotted a hijack, but the forward, who scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, is said to be insisting on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "With Mbeumo and Man Utd aligned, the Premier League giants need to agree on a fee with Brentford, but this is proving difficult.",
      "Mbeumo retains high value as Brentford have the option to automatically extend his current deal on the same terms until 2027 and they are reportedly holding out for around £70m.",
      "At this point, Man Utd are yet to meet this asking price and a report over the weekend claimed Brentford’s ‘enormous demand’ is threatening the deal.",
      "READ: Manchester United must abandon Mbeumo move and end ‘vicious cycle’",
      "It’s also been claimed that the Red Devils are considering turning to a cheaper alternative, deeming Brentford’s asking price ‘excessive’, but Fabrizio Romano insists he remains their priority.",
      "Romano claimed: “Even on Sunday, the contacts continued between Manchester United and Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "“There is still no here we go, but Man Utd keep advancing. They’re going very strong and now the feeling is positive.”",
      "Now, journalist Dean Jones for Flashscore claims Man Utd have ‘not’ been ‘deterred’ as they pursue Mbeumo and they ‘aim to have a deal wrapped up by Friday’.",
      "Man Utd were said to be ‘much closer’ to Brentford’s demands with their latest £62.5m offer and ‘further contact is expected on Monday’ amid ‘optimism that an agreement will be reached’.",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle United are mentioned as potential rivals for Mbeumo, but United’s £62.5m bid marked a ‘step in the right direction’ and Brentford ‘may consider a suitable package around £65m’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘In order for talks to progress positively, clubs must find common ground over the structure of the deal. Brentford want a substantial up-front payment and improvements in the way the rest of the fee is paid – particularly in terms of instalments and performance-related bonuses.",
      "‘Due to past high-profile failures in the transfer market, United have approached this deal with some caution. They believe this type of agreement requires patience – but at the same time, they do not want to miss out. This week has been earmarked as a potential turning point, and United remain hopeful Mbeumo can be integrated into the squad for when pre-season begins next Monday.’",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer.",
      "According to reports, Brentford have set an ‘enormous demand’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Manchester United target the 20-goal forward.",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has reportedly informed his club and Tottenham ‘of his decision to sign’ for Manchester United, following a ‘trust’ suggestion relating to Thomas Frank.",

      "20) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Arsenal\nFrom BILD, Arsenal have joined the race for the France striker, which suits Eintracht Frankfurt just fine. While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",

      "19) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe’re keeping this in the top 20 for now because, based on absolutely nothing whatsoever, we get the sense that something could happen here. Even if it’s just that Liverpool make a move upon which they are told to f*** all the way off. But selling Isak doesn’t have to be the end of the world for Newcastle.",
      "18) Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Liverpool\nThe word is that Liverpool could move for Hato if Palace don’t drop their asking price for Marc Guehi. If they do, they might have to beat Chelsea and Arsenal to it.\n17) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nArsenal’s ‘dream signing’, apparently. And it could be a go-er since the Brazilian has had his nose put out of joint by Real, and he’s asked to leave. Real have even lowered their asking price from £85million since it became clear absolutely no one was prepared to pay that much. But Arsenal could find themselves chucking a small fortune at Rodrygo.",

Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",

      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nSpurs and Arsenal are reportedly set to battle it out for the FA Cup-winning England star, who is unlikely to leave Palace for less than his £68m release clause. He’s not exactly an out-and-out left-winger but that’s probably where he’ll play for either team, and that’s a position of priority for the Gunners, while Spurs recently signed Mathys Tel permanently.",

If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer.

      "12) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal have already had one bid rejected for the Spain Under-21 centre-back but they aren’t done. A second round of talks is scheduled but given the speed at which Arsenal are working this summer, we hold little hope of a swift resolution.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",

      "10) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "9) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "7) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "6) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – and now Quansah has done his bit for his country, a move should be wrapped up this week.",
      "",
      "5) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "3) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Chelsea\nThis one moved fast over the weekend, when Newcastle and Chelsea both had bids rejected before the Blues went back with something more acceptable to the Seagulls. Apparently, the Brazilian will undergo a medical in the the United States before joining Enzo Maresca’s Club World Cup squad.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing, if it hasn’t already happened.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "18) RB Leipzig\nIt is a similar situation at Leipzig, whose very purpose as the finishing school of the Red Bull institution is to polish the gems inherited elsewhere from within their multi-club ownership model and move them on to Europe’s elite for ludicrous profit.",
      "“We are confirming it every single summer in every transfer window, we are the perfect club for young players, to help them for a certain time in their career and then to bring them to absolutely top clubs,” said Leipzig managing director of sport Marcel Schafer last year.",
      "There is now also the remote prospect of at least entering the same orbit as that massive sell-out Jurgen Klopp.",

      "The crisis baton is passed and often shared between Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs, whose competence levels have rarely converged over the last decade. Yet they remain far and away the richest clubs in the Premier League with the clearest in-built advantages. Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",
      "Their shift towards a focus on signing younger talents and helping them evolve is also enticing, while the opportunity to work with Thomas Frank could become as big a pull as Ange Postecoglou absolutely was.",

      "This remains a team in transition, with uncertainty over their manager, sporting director and a transfer policy still contingent on player churn and loans with various clauses attached.",
      "The name value and reputation undoubtedly remains but Juventus have also not made the Champions League quarter-finals since 2019 and have two Coppas Italia to show for the last five seasons.",

      "The Magpies do not feel far off becoming frequent Champions League qualifiers and an established domestic force, with regular loads of sportswashing capable of reinforcing that position once they finally get there.",
      "Yet this has been a deeply chastening summer of rejection and excuses for Newcastle. Being turned down for Real Madrid or Chelsea is one thing, but losing so conclusively in direct transfer battles with Manchester United is another.",
      "",
      "13) Atletico Madrid\nThere’s no shame in Atletico having basically one trump card to play that no other team can boast. Diego Simeone is their ace, their only feasible edge in any transfer race competed on even footing against other Champions League regulars. And he is going nowhere, probably even when Arsenal come calling.",
      "",
      "12) Napoli\nThe lure of sitting under the Scott McTominay learning tree cannot be sniffed at but there is a definite elephant in the room when it comes to Napoli’s transfer lure.",
      "Antonio Conte is simultaneously their biggest pull and most prominent red flag for prospective signings. Napoli have won Serie A twice in three seasons but with a managerial ticking time bomb liable to go off any time soon, and the volatile Aurelio De Laurentiis still in a position of power, it would be a risk to join even with their renewed offering of Champions League football.",
      "",
      "11) Manchester United\nDo not underestimate the allure of being the player who can rouse a sleeping giant. Manchester United could do worse than making it part of their negotiation pitch that incoming signings might be the one player who can fix them.",
      "Bruno Fernandes committing the best years of his career to a certified basket case proves it can work, as does Matheus Cunha rejecting Champions League football for Old Trafford with Bryan Mbeumo hoping to follow suit.",
      "Things have obviously changed since Robinho was caught off-guard by the revelation that there were two Premier League clubs based in Manchester, and United have been drowned out by many more teams than their noisy neighbours.",

      "",
      "10) Borussia Dortmund\nThe established cliche used to be that Bayern would sign the best players from Dortmund, who in turn would shop in the smaller Bundesliga markets. But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th more often than they have 2nd in the last nine Bundesliga seasons.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen and others have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t know why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, Christian Chivu has a rebuild on his hands and it ultimately tends to come down to money; Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles too.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these constant near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through, as evidenced by this summer splurge.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against has been meticulously erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "But if Arsenal are to go just one better this time, they’re surely going to need another entry in this list of the top 10 signings ever made by Premier League clubs in response to a second-place finish.",
      "With all due respect to Mikel Merino and Riccardo Calafiori, none of last year’s newbies have made the cut.",
      "",
      "10) Fernandinho\nIn the wake of relinquishing the title to their neighbours in 2013, City were manager-less while they waited for Manuel Pellegrini to replace Roberto Mancini. But that didn’t stop them from making a £30million Brazilian from Shakhtar Donetsk their first summer signing.",
      "Since the minute they brought Fernandinho to Manchester, City have been scouring the planet for his replacement. When the midfield enforcer finally departed after nine years he took five Premier League titles, six League Cups and the FA Cup with him. Kalvin Phillips, it turned out, was not quite the replacement Pep Guardiola had in mind.",
      "",
      "9) Dwight Yorke\nThe Trinidad striker wasn’t United’s top striker target in 1998 but Patrick Kluivert decided to join Louis van Gaal at Barcelona rather than link up with Ferguson at Old Trafford. So Fergie turned his attention to Yorke, much to John Gregory’s chagrin.",
      "The Villa boss insisted he wouldn’t entertain any part-exchange offer – “If players are not good enough for Manchester United, they are not good enough for Villa,” he said – but Gregory relented by asking for Andy Cole. That was a non-starter for United, who simply upped their offer to £12.6million.",

      "8) Declan Rice\nIt would be a stretch to describe the signing of Rice for a nine-figure sum as a bargain, but what Arsenal did get with the signing of the midfielder from West Ham was precisely what they wanted and needed and for which they were willing to pay so handsomely.",
      "Not a bargain then, but still value. A signing that sits alongside the likes of Alisson and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool: hugely expensive but entirely necessary and correct. The exact player needed in the exact position needed to maintain and improve a challenge against the City machine. And in Rice’s case now, also against the likes o[f Alisson and and Virgil van Dijk at Liverpool. Will it be third time lucky?",

      "“I cannot understand what is going on. I have not spoken to anyone who, when £18.6million became available, would have spent that on Michael Carrick.”",
      "That was the reaction in 2006 of Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters’ Association to the news that the Red Devils were signing Carrick to fill the void left by Roy Keane. Tottenham fans were similarly minded. Bernie Kingsley of Spurs fanzine Cock-a-Doodle-do gloated: “For that sort of money, and with midfielders like Tom Huddlestone and Didier Zokora at the club, it has got to be good business.”",
      "Indeed it was – for United. Carrick took Keane’s No.16 shirt and won the title in his first season with United. Then he won four more and everything else there was to win in 12 trophy-laden years at Old Trafford.",

      "6) Robin van Persie\nFuelled by losing the title in the final seconds of the 2011/12 season to their noisy neighbours, Sir Alex Ferguson began his Premier League last hurrah by taking Van Persie off Arsene Wenger’s hands, a switch for which he was never forgiven by Arsenal fans.",
      "Reflecting on his defection, the reigning PFA Players’ Player of the Year blamed ‘the little boy inside of me’ for turning his back on the Gunners. “That boy was screaming for Manchester United.”",
      "The boy in Van Persie’s head knew what he was talking about. The Netherlands striker was a revelation at Old Trafford, scoring 26 goals to earn the Golden Boot as United regained the title. Then Fergie retired and it all went to still-ongoing sh*t.",

      "5) Kevin De Bruyne\n“It takes a special player to improve our squad,” said Manuel Pellegrini in 2015 when City paid a club-record £55million for the Belgian, though few people really understood just how special De Bruyne was.",
      "Chelsea certainly didn’t spot it before they sold the Belgian to Wolfsburg for £16.7million a year and half before he returned to the Premier League to tear it up in a City shirt.",
      "It took De Bruyne three seasons to win his first title winner’s medal, which came a year after Pep Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad. Since then, he’s won five more to add to a Champions League, five League Cups and a couple of FA Cups.",

      "4) Sol Campbell\nEven if Campbell’s free transfer had been a disaster, it would have been worth the £100,000 spent per week on the defender’s wages just for all the p*ss it boiled across north London.",
      "But Wenger’s swoop for the England centre-back was actually a masterstroke. Campbell was a perfect replacement for Tony Adams and his arrival was the catalyst for Arsenal to end three seasons of living in Manchester United’s shadow as the bridesmaids of the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal won the title in his first season at Highbury before Campbell became an Invincible two years later. Though he was largely responsible for the end of the unbeaten run by blatantly and brutally hacking down Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford in match 50…",
      "",
      "3) Didier Drogba\nRoman Abramovich took a year or so after buying Chelsea in 2003 to get his feet under the table before really splurging. Finishing as runners-up to Arsenal’s Invincibles in 2003/04 wasn’t enough for Claudio Ranieri to keep his job so Jose Mourinho was appointed immediately after he’d led Porto to the Champions League.",
      "Following Mourinho – Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho too – through the door was Drogba, who joined from Marseille for a club-record fee of £24million. Abramovich flexed his financial muscle by offering OM double what Juventus were prepared to pay. It was money extremely well spent.",
      "Drogba went on to score 164 goals in 381 appearances across two spells with the Blues. The Premier League title in his and Mourinho’s first season was the first of four for the Ivorian, who also won four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League.",
      "",
      "2) Alan Shearer\nNewcastle blew up spectacularly in the 1995/96 title race, chucking away a 12-point lead to allow Manchester United to win the title and, subsequently, the Double. But the Toon won the summer transfer battle for the previous season’s top scorer…",
      "Shearer bagged 31 goals for seventh-placed Blackburn who allowed the striker to move on for a British record transfer fee of £15million. United and Newcastle were both willing to cough up so it was a straight choice for the England centre-forward.",
      "“I had to make a decision and at one point, I was 90 per cent certain I was going to go to Manchester United,” he reflected in 2020. “But then I got another call from Kevin Keegan and I thought ‘I’m going to go to Newcastle, it’s a club I’ve supported all my life’.”",
      "Despite all the pots United won in his absence, Shearer was content with making himself a legend in his hometown with 206 goals, making himself Newcastle’s leading scorer of all time.",
      "",
      "1) Thierry Henry\nArsenal reacted to losing the 1998/99 Premier League title race on the final day to a Treble-winning Manchester United by signing two World Cup strikers in two days at the start of August.",
      "On August 2 1999, Davor Suker joined the Gunners. He was followed a day later by a 22-year-old France forward who’d fallen out of favour at Juventus.",
      "Henry’s status at Juve didn’t deter Arsene Wenger from paying a club-record £11million fee, with Henry and Suker joining Kanu, Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars in Arsenal’s front line.",
      "“Thierry Henry is a valuable addition to our squad, he will be a great asset to Arsenal Football Club,” said Wenger, playing it cool when he signed the World Cup winner. Henry went on to earn himself a statue by scoring 228 goals for the Gunners, winning two Premier League titles along the way, even if he had to wait three seasons for his first."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Manchester City and Liverpool have overtaken them for now.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley – £46.81m\nThere has been a slew of converted loans and then the first ‘new’ signing has arrived in the form of goalkeeper Max Weiss, perhaps precipitating James Trafford’s move to Newcastle. Quickly followed by the improbably named Quilindschy Hartman.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund – £48.9m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "8) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "3. Make those 32 teams the best 32 in the world.  The only way to do this is to put teams from different federations against each other in qualification.  But it feels wrong to just mix all the sides together right from the start.  Marshall Islands would probably withdraw without playing if drawn against England, Turkey, Honduras, Iraq and Gabon.  It’s not worth the cost of the plane tickets.  So, instead, how about two rounds of qualifiers?  Start with matches within each federation, with a certain number of teams from each going through, then have a second round of qualifiers, putting teams from different confederations against each other, competing for the 32 places in the finals.",
      "Wouldn’t that be great?  A 32 team World Cup, a straight knockout with, say 14-16 European sides, 5-6 South American, Mexico & USA, Japan or South Korea or both and the rest African.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "The Red Devils have already secured the signing of Matheus Cunha to bolster Ruben Amorim’s attacking options after triggering his £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves and have been pushing to add Mbeumo to their ranks after the Frenchman’s 20 goals and eight assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "Brentford rejected an opening bid of £45m plus £10m in add-ons from United and then knocked back an improved offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons on Friday.",
      "It’s thought the Bees are holding out for £65m for their prized asset, who has reportedly told the club that he wants to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims United ‘remain confident’ and are planning to ‘improve’ on their latest proposal.",
      "Romano said: “Let me repeat once again that Man United remain confident, Man United remain optimistic. They still don’t have an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, but the conversation is still ongoing.",
      "“Manchester United, according to my sources, are prepared to improve that proposal. It’s not just about numbers. It’s not just about the transfer fee.",
      "“It’s also about the structure of the deal, payment terms, installments, also add-ons, [if they are] easy or difficult, how to activate it.",
      "“Man United are working on all these details of the deal in order to try reach an agreement with Brentford.”",
      "But that’s not the case according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim the United board see Brentford’s £65m demand as ‘excessive’, particularly as ‘other areas of the team also pending reinforcement’ and have therefore ‘moved quickly towards a more accessible option’ – namely, Ivan Toney.",
      "The Al Ali striker, who moved to the Saudi Pro League side from Brentford for £40m last summer, has ‘aroused interest’ at United as ‘they believe that his previous experience in the Premier League, his scoring sense and his physical strength make him a very valid bet to lead the attack’.",
      "The report claims that with his Transfermarkt value ‘dropping to £21m’, United have ‘put on the table an offer that could be very attractive of €30m [£26m] plus €5m [£4.3m] in add-ons’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The first contacts have already occurred both between the clubs and with the player’s environment, and from Old Trafford they are optimistic about closing the agreement in the coming days. Toney would welcome his return to the Premier League and even more so to defend the colors of a historic club like United.",
      "‘With this play, the English team not only seeks to avoid an excessive expense, but also to incorporate a striker with experience, hungry to compete again in the elite and with a profile that fits the style of play that they want to implement for the next campaign.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer.",
      "According to reports, Brentford have set an ‘enormous demand’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Manchester United target the 20-goal forward.",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has reportedly informed his club and Tottenham ‘of his decision to sign’ for Manchester United, following a ‘trust’ suggestion relating to Thomas Frank.",
      "Manchester United and Brentford have agreed a fee for the transfer of Tottenham Hotspur transfer target Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports."

      "Man Utd remain on the lookout for a new striker this summer, but hopes of landing one of their long-standing targets appear to have taken a significant knock.",
      "While much of the attention has focused on the deals already done, including the signing of Matheus Cunha and ongoing talks with Bryan Mbeumo, the club still wants to strengthen up front following a poor goals return last season.",
      "There’s also rumours that the Red Devils are ready to sign another Juventus star once the PSR deadline passes.",
      "Just 44 Premier League goals from an underperforming side have left Rasmus Hojlund under scrutiny, and recruitment chiefs are actively exploring new options.",
      "One of those is Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, a player United have tracked for some time and who was again linked in the Italian press this week.",
      "Utd are said to be watching the situation closely, with Juventus believed to be open to sales in light of financial pressures and looming accounting deadlines.",
      "Earlier this month, there were reports of direct contact between the two clubs over a potential swap deal involving Jadon Sancho. While the validity of those claims remains unclear, it reflects the reality that Juventus are open to offers, especially ones that could help ease their wage bill or balance sheet.",
      "But Vlahovic, it seems, is not playing ball.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the 25-year-old striker has told those close to him that he has “no intention of moving, whatever the cost.”",
      "The Serbian international is heading into the final year of a lucrative contract that reportedly rises to €12 million for the 2025/26 season, a figure Juventus are keen to reduce, either through a new deal or a sale.",
      "So far, Vlahovic has rejected both options. Gazzetta report that the club offered him an extension on lower wages, but that too has been turned down.",
      "Instead, the striker plans to run down his contract and leave on a free transfer next summer, aiming to secure another sizeable payday elsewhere.",
      "The report paints a tense picture between the club and the player. The relationship is described as irreconcilable, and Juventus now face the very real prospect of seeing their £62 million investment walk away for nothing.",
      "Some believe the club may even consider freezing him out of the squad, referred to as the “Chiesa method,” if a solution cannot be found.",
      "His stance also complicates Juve’s pursuit of Lille striker Jonathan David. The Canadian is available on a free transfer, and a deal is said to be close, but club officials are reluctant to carry both his wages and Vlahovic’s.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Nottingham Forest have unexpectedly taken the lead to sign Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic, with Arsenal and Man United also linked to the Serbian striker",
      "Arsenal have cleared the path for Man Utd to sign a new striker amid ‘injury concerns’ after the Red Devils’ ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the £67m man.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the camp of a European striker after they ‘approached’ the Red Devils for a transfer.",
      "Arsenal have been given hope that they can finally land long-term striker target Dusan Vlahovic for a very low fee, as Juventus have been unable to agree a new contract ...",
      "Arsenal may have had a breakthrough in their pursuit of a striker this summer as one of their January targets could be available at a cut price."

      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas claims Arsenal and Manchester United only have themselves to blame for missing out on a cut-price deal for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Both Premier League clubs are chasing the Sweden international this summer and were recently dealt a blow after Varandas dismissed reported claims that Gyokeres had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price.",
      "The Gunners are said to have had a bid of around £55m rejected for the 27-year-old while United wait to find out which of Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko will move to the Emirates before feeding on the ‘scraps’.",
      "Varandas has doubled down on his claim that Gyokeres ‘will not leave for €70m’ and cited the Arsenal and United transfers that have already been made or are set to be imminently confirmed this summer as the reason why.",
      "As quoted by the Portuguese media outlet A Bola, Varandas said: “Sporting is very calm about Gyokeres. Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres.",
      "“We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor ‘s dreams.",

      "“If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. We have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65 million (£55m).",
      "“I saw two players being sold in the Premier League – Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo – forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70m.",
      "“We are talking about players who are 26 years old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor ‘s value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "“I won’t say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60+€10 million. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm.",
      "“There are only two scenarios: one club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dream, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.”",

      "For their part, United want to seal his permanent exit in order to raise funds for their own rebuild and to get his £300,000-per-week salary off their wage bill, but a report from The Telegraph claims the club bosses now accept that they will now likely need to heavily subsidise loan moves for a number of their players this summer ‘with buying clubs ready to exploit the need to offload players before the start of the Premier League season’.",
      "The report states:",
      "‘[Alejandro] Garnacho, Rashford and Brazil forward Antony have contracts until 2028, which United are now expected to subsidise even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will also be allowed to leave after loans in the last two campaigns.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, although intermediaries believe their ‘bargaining power has been undermined by clearly wanting players off their books.’",

      "It’s claimed Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski are ‘the two options’ who could leave to open the door for Rashford, but ‘both look complicated’ as neither player wants to leave the club.",

      "‘The Barça coach has made it clear that he does not want an oversized squad, especially in attack. With Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Lewandowski, the offensive positions are more than covered. That’s why Flick has been categorical: Rashford could only arrive if a weight loss occurs first.’",

      "We even saw Fabrizio Romano looking ever so slightly exasperated at having to explain that Gyokeres “didn’t say no” to Manchester United but also definitely didn’t say yes as if he was talking Red Devils fans down from a ledge, and he bloody loves this stuff.",
      "He knows as well as we do that it’s these sort of transfer sagas that keep him in multiple mobiles and whatever else he spends his money on, and essentially pays our wages. And this one really is a doozy: two big-name strikers; two Premier League giants; desperation on each and every side.",
      "There are multiple angles to approach it from, opportunities for nuance for those tricksy headline writers and therefore thousands upon thousands of transfer-obsessed eyeballs lapping up every last update, U-turn and plot twist.",
      "We both want it to rumble on so we can garner those sweet, sweet clicks and for it to stop immediately so we can write about something, anything besides. But even if we have to grin and bear it for several more weeks while our advertisers rub their hands with glee, with a goal-orientated mindset we can all take solace in the likely outcome being very, very funny.",
      "The thought of United feeding on Arsenal’s transfer ‘scraps’ is in itself delightful. But far better than that is the very good chance that one of Gyokeres or Sesko will flop while the other shines having either won or lost the race to sign for Arsenal.",
      "Both being held in such high regard means it would be funny no matter which of them flops at which club. Manchester United spending another £60m-odd on a striker to score no goals is funny. Better than that? Gyokeres being that striker having scored them at a rate of one every 84 minutes under the very same manager at Sporting. That would excellent.",

      "But not as excellent as Arsenal starting the season with the striker they’ve needed for half a decade before reverting to Kai Havertz come Christmas and then Mikel Merino when it comes to the Champions League punch in March, before we’re all treated to the revisionist pundits insisting they didn’t ever think a striker was the answer anyway.",
      "And that brings us to our ideal scenario. We want Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, after what may or may not have been but have certainly been reported to be several flip flops between the two strikers, to choose Gyokeres as their flop because a) he has very little sell-on value as a 27-year-old, b) their concerns over him scoring goals in a minor league would prove to be amusingly well-founded, and c) (and this is absolutely the main reason) he was Manchester United’s first choice all along.",
      "Even if Sesko somehow weirdly decided there was a different option after being snubbed by Arsenal and didn’t join the transfer market scavengers, we will have been well sated by Gyokeres being utterly terrible for the Gunners given they will have both chosen him and won a battle with United to secure his signature. That’s good stuff.",

      "Gyokeres is desperate to leave Sporting this summer and wants to join Arsenal, who are currently deciding between him and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko as their new No.9.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently dismissed reported claims that the Sweden international had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price, though it’s thought they are willing to let him leave for around £65m this summer.",
      "Arsenal are said to have made a bid of around £55m which has been rejected, and are currently deciding whether to launch a new offer while United wait in the wings.",
      "It’s been claimed that the Red Devils could end up feeding on the Gunners’ transfer ‘scraps’ – signing whichever out of Gyokeres or Sesko doesn’t get their desired move to the Emirates.",
      "In any case, both clubs, but perhaps Gyokeres most of all, have been handed a boost in order to get the deal done, with The Sun claiming Sporting have reached an ‘agreement’ with the striker that he need not return for pre-season on Tuesday, giving Arsenal, United or other suitors until July 7 to get the deal done.",
      "Meanwhile, United have been dealt a blow in their bid to reduce their wage bill this summer as previously ‘condemned’ £350,000-per-week midfielder Casemiro is ‘set to stay’, according to Mirror.",
      "The Brazilian has – somewhat unfairly – been seen as a poster boy for United’s demise, with pundits and fans using his £60m transfer on a four-year-deal as a 30-year-old on massive wages as a sign of the fuzzy thinking at Old Trafford.",
      "Reports when Ruben Amorim arrived to replace Erik ten Hag claimed Casemiro ‘didn’t interest him’ and would be one of the first out in a ‘clean up’ in order to make space on the wage bill.",
      "The Portuguese coach ‘wanted him out’ in January and was left ‘raging’ when the club bosses failed to find a buyer.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe then brutally named Casemiro when listing five “not good enough” or “overpaid” (or both) players as he discussed the club’s financial woes with Gary Neville.",
      "Reports of United’s desperate search for a club to take Casemiro off their hands amid reported interest from Saudi Arabia and the player’s apparent willingness to leave continued for most of the season, but his increased role in Amorim’s side towards the end of the campaign and an uptick in his performances changed the dynamic.",
      "Amorim then performed a U-turn and backed the midfielder to see out his contract at Old Trafford as he wants to retain leaders in his dressing room, and now – having earned a shock recall for Brazil by Carlo Ancelotti earlier this month – Casemiro now wants to stay as he believes he has a better chance of playing in the 2026 World Cup if he remains at United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are set to miss out on Viktor Gyokeres, who is ‘crazy to sign’ for another club as they prepare a ‘full-throttle offer’.",

      "We’re all tired of the Gyokeres or Sesko to Arsenal or Man Utd nonsense, but if we can just hang on the outcome looks set to be very, very funny."

      "These 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer. It’s a pretty decent side, to be fair.",
      "Players expected to make intra-Premier League moves took priority for us, as they’re more interesting – with a couple of exceptions, like European champions Paris Saint-Germain wanting a Bournemouth player.",
      "",
      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nHe cried as he waved goodbye to the Villa Park faithful in Aston Villa’s penultimate match of the season. There aren’t many clearer signs a player is leaving than that, surely?",
      "Martinez is ready for a fresh challenge and is apparently desperate to join Manchester United, which should be enough to put off other potential suitors, because honestly, what is he on?",
      "We also had the option to pick from Chelsea’s goalkeepers. Kepa Arrizabalaga is closing in on a move to Arsenal, youngster Mike Penders will leave on loan to continue his progression into a Thibaut Courtois regen, and Djordje Petrovic is surplus to requirements after a stellar campaign on loan at Strasbourg in France.",
      "",
      "RB: Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nThe majority of the Chelsea squad would be sold in an instant if a decent enough bid comes in. There are some exceptions like Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the money the Blues would accept being at world-record level — which is never going to be offered.",
      "Disasi spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and frequently played right-back after doing so for Chelsea. He’s 27 now and clearly not wanted at Stamford Bridge. His Villa Park loan didn’t do much to increase his value, but the Blues will be confident they can flog him back to France, or maybe even Saudi Arabia if it comes to that.",
      "",
      "CB: Nayef Aguerd (West Ham)\nFor reasons of variety, we have shifted Disasi to the right and brought in Aguerd, rather than including Aston Villa youngster and natural right-back Kosta Nedeljkovic right after Martinez.",
      "Despite hoping to avoid returning loanees when possible, we’ve gone back-to-back in that respect. Moroccan international Aguerd spent last season at Real Sociedad and a permanent departure is on the cards.",
      "There’s interest from Italy in the form of Juventus and Roma, which kind of suggests he should be starting for West Ham…",
      "",
      "CB: Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth)\nPerhaps the most debatable name on this list as Bournemouth have already sold half of their defence and aren’t re-signing their on-loan goalkeeper, but PSG are hell-bent on landing Zabarnyi. The writing is on the wall.",
      "Zabarnyi is a very impressive young centre-back who was overshadowed by the younger Dean Huijsen, who has signed for Real Madrid. Milos Kerkez has also joined Liverpool for £40million. Bournemouth are going to look very different next season.",
      "",
      "LB: Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nArsenal are going to get rubbish money for Zinchenko, but they’ll still move him on. He only has one year left on his contract and earns £150,000 a week [Capology], so anything over £10million will probably suffice.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Atletico Madrid, who are also considering signing Liverpool’s Andy Robertson. In the Premier League, Fulham have been linked as Marco Silva looks to continue his evil plan to become Arsenal B.",

Five underwhelming signings who helped deliver instant Premier League titles",
      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Manchester City)\nWe really have zero clue what’s next for Phillips. This never seemed possible, but even Leeds United are reportedly unwilling to go near him now. Every player in this XI has interest, but not Phillips. It’s anyone’s guess where he ends up. The idea of a move to Rangers or Celtic makes so much sense in my head. More so Rangers; he feels right for Russell Martin’s system.",
      "Phillips spent last season on loan at Ipswich Town, who got relegated with a pathetic 22 points. He had his injury problems, but looked poor at the start of the season and got sent off against Leicester City on matchday 10, which resulted in a one-game ban. He didn’t return for nearly two months thanks to an ankle injury and was an unused substitute three times.",
      "If he couldn’t get sufficient minutes for the second-worst team in the Premier League, how is he expected to stay at Man City? Well, he isn’t.",
      "",
      "CM: Sean Longstaff (Newcastle United)\nThe pure profit Newcastle are seeking from the sale of Longstaff should help them, though we can’t imagine him fetching a large fee. If Christian Norgaard is worth £10m, surely he is worth around the same, taking into account his homegrown status.",
      "Newcastle have outgrown Longstaff, and there’s minimal chance he usurps Sandro Tonali or Bruno Guimaraes in Eddie Howe’s pecking order. Those two are in a different stratosphere, with all due respect.",
      "",
      "CM: Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nIncluding Eberechi Eze was tempting, but he’s not guaranteed to leave Crystal Palace, is he? There’s a decent chance he does, but it’s hard to envision him pushing for an exit and getting all arsey about it.",
      "Elliott has discussed his future, saying he doesn’t want to waste his best years sitting on the bench for Liverpool, and there should be lots of clubs interested in signing him this summer. Everton are a frustratingly good fit, but that doesn’t seem likely because of, you know, the rivalry and that.",
      "He is not short of interest, though, and that’s the main thing. Elliott would improve nearly every Premier League team. Including Manchester United.",
      "MORE: Liverpool must answer Elliott question, Carsley next for England and Joe Hart continues to impress",
      "",
      "RW: Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nManchester United looked destined to sign Mbeumo but have been messing around with their valuation, with Brentford standing very firm. This has allowed Tottenham Hotspur to creep in, and even with Thomas Frank’s appointment, the Cameroonian hasn’t exactly had his head turned. He’s certainly open to joining Spurs if the Red Devils don’t get a grip, but Old Trafford is his preferred destination.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is an honourable mention. Bournemouth are under no pressure to sell and their asking price is reportedly £70m, which Semenyo is absolutely not worth.",
      "",
      "LW: Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nSancho and his pal Marcus Rashford are both available, but the latter’s wages make his exit more complicated. The former is also on a lot of money, but not as much, has played abroad before, and has a lower asking price; he’s clearly the more realistic permanent departure.",
      "Rumours of a move to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho have unfortunately been quashed, but there’s also interest from Italian clubs Napoli and Juventus.",
      "",
      "ST: Joao Pedro (Brighton)\nChelsea and Newcastle are both vying for Pedro’s signature this summer, and despite his departure leaving Brighton very light up front, it looks inevitable after a difficult end to 2024/25, which reportedly involved a training ground bust-up with Jan Paul van Hecke.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
