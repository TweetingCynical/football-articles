      "Raheem Sterling swapped one London club for another at the last minute in 2024, allowing Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to escape Old Trafford and head to Chelsea. Last year's deadline day was full of surprises in the Premier League, with Chelsea's dramatic dealings sparking plenty of headlines.",
      "Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal, and United saw Sancho and Sterling move to different parts of London on loan for the new campaign. As the transfer window slammed shut, the Blues released a small statement confirming Sterling's departure, which simply read, \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger - who is now 30 years old and back at Stamford Bridge - completed a last-minute loan switch to the Emirates Stadium. This was after it became clear he was not part of manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club throughout the summer.",
      "Chelsea saw another new addition to their squad: the arrival of former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially was swapped in for Sterling. The England international was also left out of then-boss Erik ten Hag's plans at United and had been free to depart either on loan or on a permanent deal.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the chosen location for the young attacker, as United agreed to an obligation to buy price of £23million if certain targets were met. That was a far cry from the £73.5m that the club paid back in the summer of 2021 to lure Sancho to Manchester, but he hardly pulled up trees at Old Trafford, registering just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances, subsequently seeing his stock fall dramatically.",
      "Meanwhile, Sterling was reunited with an old friend at Arsenal; boss Mikel Arteta, who spent a lot of time working under Pep Guardiola during the forward's seven-year tenure with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the end of the 2024/25 season regardless of his impact in north London.",
      "During his time at Arsenal, the forward managed just one goal and assisted five times in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League. Sterling was used sparingly and arguably enjoyed his best game when he helped Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice score in a 2-2 draw with PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's elite competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but ultimately finished the season without silverware and barely any game time before heading back to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho had a more impactful year with Chelsea, scoring five goals and assisting 10 times across 41 appearances both domestically and in Europe. Most of the young winger's goals came in the Premier League, but it was in the knockout stages of the Conference League where he shone the most for the Blues.",
      "After making the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund while on loan in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho made yet another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, and they dispatched the Spanish club in style, winning 4-1 with Sancho scoring the third in the 83rd minute of the game.",
      "However, Chelsea opted not to pay a fee to United to avoid having to trigger Sancho's buyout clause, having failed to be convinced by the winger despite his role in helping them claim silverware.",
      "Now, Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still trying to secure a move away for the winger as he is not part of the Portuguese manager's plans for the future.",
      "Sancho has already turned down moves to Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly wanted by several clubs, while Sterling is also unwanted at Chelsea. With both players in difficult positions at their clubs, there's every chance they could one again be involved in a dramatic deadline day move, and will hope this time they can make more of an impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Few signings will ever match the hype and euphoria Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Manchester United brought on transfer deadline day. In summer 2021, following the exciting new additions of Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho, United appeared set to suffer a blow as club legend Ronaldo looked to make a return to the Premier League.",
      "The then-36-year-old was strongly linked with a move to neighbours Manchester City. But the Red Devils made a last-ditch intervention with Juventus and Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, while club legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Rio Ferdinand phoned the player to dissuade him from joining City.",
      "What followed was a bombshell announcement that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner had apparently made a U-turn to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side – 12 years after he left for Real Madrid and went on to become one of the greatest players of all time. For many fans, it marked the homecoming of their dreams and represented a return to the old Manchester United, which had been lost since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.",
      "Ronaldo’s sensational return cost an initial £13million, but totalled £38m when factoring in the £385,000-a-week he was paid over the next 64 weeks he spent in Manchester. Despite being a big sum for a player in his mid-30s, it still represented a salary cut on the £500,000-per-week he had received at Juve.",
      "And, simply put, the fans didn’t care as they raced to print the Portuguese icon’s name on the back of their 2021/22 jerseys. The feel-good factor was through the roof. A swashbuckling United led by club legend Solskjaer had finished second the previous season and here they were, adding the most lethal finisher in history to their ranks.",
      "Ronaldo said after his move was announced: “Manchester United is a club that has always had a special place in my heart, and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I have received since the announcement on Friday.",
      "”I cannot wait to play at Old Trafford in front of a full stadium and see all the fans again. I'm looking forward to joining up with the team after the international games, and I hope we have a very successful season ahead.”",
      "Having initially joined the Old Trafford club in 2003, Ronaldo went from an exciting prospect to a world beater over the next six years, netting more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributing to United securing three Premier League crowns, plus the Champions League.",
      "Upon his return, he was given his iconic No. 7 shirt back and scored on his second debut against Newcastle. More goals followed as he registered 24 in all competitions, but his efforts were in vain as United struggled for form and Solskjaer was sacked early on in his first season.",
      "Ronaldo would play under two interim managers that season in Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick as he visibly grew more and more frustrated at the side's fall from grace. Ronaldo reportedly made attempts to engineer a move elsewhere but failed to do so before the transfer window, while United refused to let him go.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s appointment as permanent boss in the summer of 2022 presented a potential fresh start, until it became clear the Dutchman was not giving his veteran forward any preferential treatment. The Portuguese was omitted from the Manchester derby defeat to rivals Manchester City, which became a huge talking point.",
      "Ten Hag claimed he left Ronaldo on the bench \"out of respect\" as United were 4-0 at half-time, though he later asked Ronaldo to come on as a substitute three minutes before the end of the victory over Tottenham, which the striker refused to do.",
      "Ronaldo then stormed down the tunnel and out of Old Trafford before the final whistle – an incident he admitted he regretted. Ten Hag had responded to that tantrum by suspending him for one fixture before making Ronaldo captain for the next four matches.",
      "However, Ronaldo’s mind was already made and, ahead of the 2022 World Cup, he sat down for a tell-all interview with close friend Piers Morgan on Talk TV, where he blasted both Ten Hag and predecessor Rangnick.",
      "The forward said he had been “betrayed” by United, also claiming Ten Hag had tried to force him out of the club. United responded by terminating his contract, paving the way for his move to current club Al-Nassr in January 2023, and bringing one of the club’s biggest and most exciting signings ever's time to a bitter end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The final day of the transfer market is finally here and it could be hectic few hours for Premier League clubs and beyond. Clubs in the top flight have already spent heavily so far and more could yet be splashed.",
      "Liverpool are in line for an extremely lucrative day. Newcastle have finally opened the door to Alexander Isak's exit, with the Reds agreeing to pay £125million to sign the striker on a six-year deal. The reigning Premier League champions are also after a new centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi right at the top of their list.",
      "Across the north west, Manchester United might be busy. They are after a new goalkeeper, with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez potentially the man set to move to Old Trafford. Outgoings could also be on the cards, with Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and more all primed for exits.",
      "Arsenal could conclude an eye-watering summer with a move for Bayer Leverkusen star Piero Hincapie, with exits also likely.",
      "There are also some tricky situations to solve at both Newcastle and Chelsea. Away from Isak, Newcastle are chasing Yoane Wissa, who has requested to leave Brentford. Finally, the Blues are attempting to welcome two strikers back to Stamford Bridge, with Marc Guiu and Nicolas Jackson potentially being recalled.",
      "The deadline for deals is 7pm this evening, albeit deal sheets could see negotiations carry on until well after that.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie is in London finalising his switch to Arsenal, writes Ryan Taylor.",
      "The deal is a £45million package, an initial loan with a buy-option that can be formally triggered next summer. Arsenal are understood to be optimistic they can complete the deal before the 7pm transfer deadline.",
      "The Ecuador international is expected to be the only Deadline Day arrival and would become the club's eighth summer signing. His arrival will trigger Jakub Kiwior's switch to Porto; the Pole is already in Portugal and has completed his medical tests. The deal is an initial loan but the package is worth up to £23.4m including bonuses.",
      "Midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga has already completed a medical ahead of a permanent switch to Hamburg and he could also be joined by Fabio Vieira (on loan) at the Bundesliga club.",
      "Fulham remain a possible option for Reiss Nelson - that would also be a loan - while Arsenal and Marseille are still speaking about a possible move for Oleksandr Zinchenko, which is complex due to his salary.",
      "Liverpool may be landing Alexander Isak for a British record transfer fee but their pursuit of Marc Guehi is in the balance, writes Chris McKenna.",
      "The Reds bid £35m with a 10 per cent sell on clause for the Crystal Palace defender on Saturday. It has yet to be rejected but Palace have not entered talks.",
      "Palace boss Oliver Glasner is insisting he can’t go but chairman Steve Parish is weighing up whether the club can afford to turn down the fee when the England centre back can leave for nothing next summer.",
      "It could still happen today but it is not guaranteed.",
      "Nayef Aguerd will leave West Ham for Marseille today, according to The Guardian.",
      "Aguerd will join the French side for €23million (£20m), leaving the Hammers to find a replacement today.",
      "Piero Hincapie will become an Arsenal player today, having travelled to London yesterday to complete a medical.",
      "The Bayer Leverkusen defender is joining the Gunners on loan, but his move will become permanent next summer for £45million.",
      "His arrival allows Jakub Kiwior to move to Porto on loan with an obligation to buy for £24m.",
      "Manchester United have been desperate to offload their unwanted players this summer - and their desperation is clear in the sale of Antony to Real Betis.",
      "United signed Antony from Ajax for £81million just two years ago, and are now flogging him to Betis for €25m (£21m) plus a potential €3m (£2.6m) in bonuses, according to The Athletic, who report that they will have a 50 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "They have at least got rid of his wages, but that is quite the loss on the Brazilian winger.",
      "With Alexander Isak heading over to Merseyside today for a medical with Liverpool, Newcastle fans will be awaiting news of a new striker arriving at St James' Park.",
      "The Magpies have been chasing Yoane Wissa all summer, with the Brentford striker increasingly frustrated with his club's stance. Wissa has suggested that the goalposts have been moved, with a £40m fee no longer acceptable and £65m wanted. He remains in limbo today.",
      "Newcastle have also seen bids rejected by Wolves for Jorgen Strand Larsen. They have signed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but really need two strikers after losing Callum Wilson to West Ham on a free transfer.",
      "Manchester United could move to sign a goalkeeper today to fix a problem that has been obvious all summer.",
      "Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have been anything but reliable - and Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is on the cards.",
      "Unai Emery left him out of the Aston Villa squad last night and admitted the situation needed resolving. \"It is not helping us. One of the circumstances not helping,\" he said after Villa lost 3-0 against Crystal Palace.",
      "\"We will see how we close the transfer window. We have a lot of circumstances that are not helping us be mentally like we were last year.\"",
      "Asked why he was left out, Emery replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Liverpool appear to have everything in place for Alexander Isak, but they also want to land Marc Guehi today.",
      "The Crystal Palace captain played and scored in a 3-0 win over Aston Villa last night and his situation appears more complicated.",
      "Palace boss Oliver Glasner has made it clear that he wants to keep Guehi, but with less than a year left on his contract, can they afford to walk away from a £40million deal?",
      "We will wait and see.",
      "It has been widely reported that Liverpool have now agreed a deal with Newcastle to sign Alexander Isak and end the saga of the summer.",
      "This outcome always felt likely, but a Premier League record deal for £130million remains a blockbuster deal.",
      "The Athletic reports that everything is agreed and Isak will undergo a medical today before signing a six-year contract with Liverpool.",
      "The change of stance comes after Newcastle landed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, while they continue to chase another striker - either Brentford's Yoane Wissa, or Wolves' Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "And welcome to what promises to be a busy, busy day of transfers in the Premier League and beyond.",
      "All eyes will be on Liverpool, who are trying to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi."

      "The move to Portman Road brought to an end his 17-year association with the Red Devils, having been at the club from the age of eight and progressing through the club’s youth system.",

      "Speaking at the time, Solskjaer said. \"Axel is a captain in the making, he's a leader. Why not give it to young kids? How does he handle it? He was fine, he enjoyed it. It's just a way of telling him that we trust him.\"",
      "Solskjaer wasn’t the only one aware of Tuanzebe’s leadership abilities. Harry Maguire was also one of those to note his potential to be leader with the Red Devils.",
      "\"We have a lot of leaders in the dressing room, a lot of senior pros,\" Maguire said. \"And you don’t have to be a senior pro to be a leader. Axel is a leader, in the ways that he works and speaks in the dressing room. And he’s only a young boy, he’s still learning his trade. I’m sure he’ll go on to have an unbelievable career.\"",
      "Tuanzebe left Old Trafford having made 37 appearances for the first team, injuries having hugely disrupted his time with the club. And that appears to have been a sticking point for the defender having lodged a legal complaint against his former side for “medical negligence”.",
      "Meanwhile, United appear to have moved on, with Amorim having put together a leadership group over the summer. He said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys now. They are responsible for the group.",
      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them in this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.",

      "Buckle up, Manchester United fans, it's set to be a busy transfer deadline day. With £207.5million spent on their attack, the Red Devils are focussed on bolstering the other end of the pitch before Monday's 7pm cutoff.",
      "United are looking to finish as fast as they started the summer transfer window, having welcomed Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million move from Wolves all the way back on June 1. Cunha's arrival at Old Trafford was followed up by the addition of Bryan Mbeumo, as after weeks of fraught negotiations with Brentford, the Red Devils stumped up a £71m package to land his signature.",
      "After Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko was signed in a deal which could rise to £74m, completing a new-look forward line for Ruben Amorim. Scoring goals from open play has still been an issue in the early stages of the 2025-26 season but's conceding them which has really harmed United.",
      "The Red Devils are yet to keep a clean sheet and the finger has often been pointed at the man between the posts. That's why Amorim wants to sign at least one new goalkeeper - and to finally offload a hoard of unwanted stars.",
      "Here are seven deals which United are looking to complete before the transfer window shuts.",
      "First up, it's United's most glaring issue: goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir has played every Premier League game so far but hasn't been convincing while Andre Onana's performance at Grimsby was nothing shirt of a disaster.",
      "So, the Red Devils have turned to Senne Lammens. An improved bid was sent to Royal Antwerp on Sunday and United hope to complete the signing of the 23-year-old Belgian, with the deal set to cost upwards of £20million.",
      "As a contingency, though, the Red Devils made fresh contact with Aston Villa to discuss Emiliano Martinez, who's already agreed personal terms. The Argentina international, 32, is much more established than Lammens, who could join Villa his a replacement, but would cost significantly more.",
      "Lammens and Martinez aren't the only goalkeepers in United's sights. Abdulla Al-Hammadi, a former Everton trialist, has been on trial at Old Trafford during the summer, training with the club's academy.",
      "The MEN report that 20-year-old Al-Hammadi, who hails from the UAE, has impressed staff and will be an academy signing. Due to being a free agent, Al-Hammadi doesn't need to be signed before the deadline.",
      "After ex-United star Scott McTominay, Rasmus Hojlund wants to be next player to reignite his career at Napoli. Hojlund, 22, is poised to join the Serie A champions on loan for the season, banking United £5m, before a £38m obligation to buy kicks in next summer.",
      "Another Red Devil who reignited his career away from Old Trafford is Antony - but he's still at United. The 25-year-old Brazilian has been holding out for a return to Real Betis all summer, and just as there looked to be light at the end of the tunnel, the Spanish side withdrew their offer.",
      "After Betis went public, it's now a stalemate. \"There is no agreement for Antony and we have withdrawn the offer,\" the club explained. \"We can't afford the fee and the amounts that Manchester United must instead pay the player before the transfer.\"",

      "Martinez, 32, was heavily linked with United earlier in the summer. But news that United were considering making a last-ditch attempt to lure him to Old Trafford before the end of the transfer window emerged on Sunday morning.",
      "United have been in talks with Royal Antwerp over a deal for their 23-year-old goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, with The Telegraph reporting that the club have tabled an improved offer for the player ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "Martinez is an option if a deal for the Belgian cannot be achieved with reports from Europe confirming that the World Cup winner and Manchester United have already reached an agreement on personal terms ahead of a potential switch.",

      "United are expected to bring in a new goalkeeper before the window closes with neither Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir convincing in their appearances so far this season. Talks over a deal for Lammens have been ongoing but it emerged over the weekend that United had rekindled their interest in Martinez, though they will only sign one.",
      "Martinez, 32, was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the summer. It was reported on Sunday that United have, in fact, now approached their Premier League rivals over a possible transfer, with an agreement on personal terms already in place. At the same time, news of an approach from Villa emerged.",
      "The Telegraph have since outlined that United have returned to the table with a new offer for Lammens, who they claim is the Red Devils' preferred target to come in and compete with Onana and Bayindir.",
      "The 23-year-old is highly regarded in Belgium by both club and country and has also attracted interest from Galatasaray. He is keen on the idea of moving to Old Trafford, though, if a deal can be done in the next 36 hours.",
      "While Lammens is likely to cost in excess of £20million, that is around half of the £40m that Villa would likely demand to part with Martinez. United have spent in excess of £200m on new attackers this summer as they bid to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign last year.",
      "Bayindir has started all three of United's games in the Premier League so far this season but has been at fault for goals against Arsenal and Fulham. Onana, meanwhile, did not cover himself in glory with a poor display in midweek when United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town of League Two.",

According to reports, the couple hit their first stumbling block after Eamonn reportedly pulled out of purchasing a £550,000 semi-detached house in West Yorkshire.",
      "The couple allegedly started dating back in August last year.",
      "And so, in a desperate bid to ease her disappointment, Eamonn has been lavishing her with a number of luxury treats.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed a loan exit for young forward Ethan Williams. The teenager has signed a new deal at Old Trafford, extending his contract until 2028 before completing a season-long move to Falkirk.",
      "Williams took part in United's pre-season tour, scoring in a 4-1 friendly victory over Bournemouth. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Cheltenham, netting twice, and now faces a year in the Scottish top-flight.",
      "“We’re absolutely delighted to bring Ethan Williams to Falkirk,\" the Scottish club's manager John McGlynn said. He confirmed former United centre-back Jonny Evans played a part in the move, having taken on a new role at Old Trafford since his summer retirement.",
      "\"He’s a young player of real quality who has been developed in one of the best academies in the world at Manchester United, and he now has the chance to take the next step in his career with us,\" McGlynn added. \"Ethan is quick, direct, and has an eye for goal, qualities that we feel will add a different dimension to our attacking play and excite the supporters.",
      "“Ethan is a player we’ve had our eye on for some time, we were chasing this deal before the window even opened. It’s been a long road getting him to Falkirk with plenty of twists and turns along the way, but we always felt it was worth persevering with and we’re delighted to finally get it over the line.\"",
      "He joins a growing list of United stars to complete loan moves away from Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford is spending the season at Barcelona, with Toby Collyer at West Brom and Ethan Wheatley at Northampton.",
      "\"Last term, he did well with Cheltenham Town in League Two, scoring his first goals in senior football,\" United said in a statement about Williams once the loan was announced. \"A new experience awaits him north of the border, after a deal was concluded with the Bairns.\"",
      "There are still a few more deals left to be wrapped up. Among those is another loan, wit Rasmus Hojlund on the verge of trading Manchester for Napoli on loan with a view to a permanent switch next summer, and Alejandro Garnacho has now made a permanent move from United to Chelsea.",
      "United are also still working to complete a deal for Antony to return to Real Betis. The teams are a little apart on the financial terms, specifically concerning a potential payment to the Brazilian to make up for his wage drop.",
      "\"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer,\" the Spanish club said in a statement on Friday. The winger thrived on loan at the club last season, but a permanent move - for a fee of around £21.6million - now hangs in the balance.",

It is understood Argentina World Cup winner Martinez is preferred because of his greater experience, particularly in the Premier League, which is why United are pushing hard for him.",
      "There have been unconfirmed suggestions that Martinez has been left out of Villa's squad for tonight's Premier League encounter at home to Crystal Palace, ahead of his potential exit.",
      "Villa would want around £40million for Martinez, while Lammens, 23, would cost United in the region of £20m, which is a major consideration for United, against the backdrop of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Martinez turns 33 next week and selling him to United would help Villa in their compliance with PSR and they are understood to be willing to cash in on their experienced keeper if a fee meets their valuation of him.",
      "Onana, who cost United £43m from Inter Milan in 2023, was at fault in United's shock EFL Cup exit at Grimsby in midweek, while Bayindir has also struggled in his outings against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Former United defender Victor Lindelof, who left at the end of last season when his contract expired, is understood to be on the verge of joining Villa.",

He played nearly 300 games for the club, winning both domestic cups and making the squad for the Europa League final defeats in 2021 and 2025.",

      "Ten Hag, 55, signed a contract until 2027 back in May after being selected to succeed Xabi Alonso, who guided Leverkusen to their first ever German title. Ten Hag always had big shoes to fill with Alonso moving onto pastures new - but it now seems the 'experiment' of appointing the Dutchman may be over before it could even get going.",
      "After watching Leverkusen twice blow a lead in their 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen on Saturday, Kicker claim that the club's top brass may shortly take nuclear action with last year's Bundesliga runners-up winless after their opening two league games.",
      "It's noted that there was no statement in support of Ten Hag either before or after Saturday's match, where Werder Bremen struck in the 94th minute to deny Leverkusen victory.",
      "Furthermore, there has been 'criticism' of Ten Hag internally with Leverkusen planning to review their head coach's future after the transfer window closes on Monday, with the report going on to suggest that Simon Rolfes and Co have 'probably already made up their minds'.",
      "Such a move would represent a significant blow for Ten Hag, whose reputation was bruised by a turbulent final few months at Old Trafford. He was expected to be sacked despite winning the FA Cup in his final full season at the helm, only to be handed a contract extension. He was then removed from his post before the end of October after another chastening run of form.",
      "Speaking after Saturday's late collapse against Bremen, Ten Hag said: “The players aren’t ready. We have a new team and some of the players aren’t at all fit enough to play. The team didn’t function at all during the final stage of the game. That’s just the way it is. They need to bring more intensity and get fitter in order to meet my standards.",

After United blew a 3-2 lead in the Danish capital, contributing to the Red Devils' early exit that season, the Sweden youth international came off the bench and scored a stunning goal to win the game for Copenhagen.",
      "A serious knee injury kept Bardghji out for most of last season, returning in March after 334 days on the sidelines. Barcelona snapped him up in July, yet their financial problems have led to a tumultuous start to his career in Catalunya.",
      "Due to La Liga's salary cap rules, Barca have struggled to register players, as they've needed to offload first. Club chiefs recently took advantage of a rule which allows them to use some of injured captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen's wages in order to sign-off on players.",
      "After Ter Stegen agreed to the move following an ugly dispute with Barcelona officials, United loanee Marcus Rashford and new goalkeeper Joan Garcia were registered the day before their opening game of the season at Mallorca, a 3-0 win. No new players were registered in time for last Sunday's 3-2 victory over Levante.",

That leaves Bardghji as the only exception.",

      "Ruben Amorim is on the verge of breaking a Manchester United golden rule that has lasted almost 90 years. Woven into the fabric of the Red Devils’ history and club culture is the production line of academy talents into the first team.",
      "Following the countless names to make the step, the Class of ‘92 were the most famous group of players to ascend, having a seismic impact on English football. Even in the period since those glory years, England internationals like Danny Welbeck, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford showed that Carrington can still produce high-quality youngsters.",
      "As such, United have managed to maintain an astonishing tradition that is the envy of rival clubs, by including an academy graduate in every first-team squad since October 1937. However, that record now appears vulnerable.",
      "Following Rashford’s move to Barcelona, Alejandro Garnacho’s Chelsea transfer and veteran Jonny Evans’ retirement, Kobbie Mainoo is one of the only players in the current squad to have come through the academy alongside Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson - and was the only one who featured in Saturday's 3-2 win over Burnley.",
      "But even the 20-year-old has now been linked with an exit due to Amorim’s lack of faith in the midfielder. Mainoo was once considered a key component of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons.",
      "The youngster racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago. He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner.",
      "But, under Amorim, Mainoo has started just 16 games over the past two seasons. Having been left on the bench for two successive Premier League matches, Mainoo finally played in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "He had not played a minute of Premier League football this season before coming on as a half-time substitute in the 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday. That led to frustration on the youngster’s part.",
      "It was recently reported that Serie A champions Napoli were interested in offering the £50million-rated Mainoo a four-year contract. Having seen former United team-mate Scott McTominay make the same move 12 months ago and enjoy huge success, Mainoo reportedly told United bosses he wants to leave on a permanent deal ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "Despite United’s negotiations over an extension to his current contract having stalled, the club opted to block his move to Serie A. And Amorim has been vocal about his desire for Mainoo to stay and fight for his place in the team, showing his reluctance to part ways with the team’s last academy graduate.",
      "The Portuguese said in his press conference ahead of the clash with Burnley: \"I want Kobbie to stay. He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "While a section of fans have expressed concern on social media over United’s long-standing tradition potentially coming to an end, some are unfussed, believing the team’s performances should be a priority.",
      "Should Mainoo get his last-minute move to Napoli, United would still have veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton among their ranks to select for the matchday squad in order to preserve the tradition.",
      "But the 39-year-old, who featured for the academy between 2002 and 2005, is currently behind Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir in the pecking order, while United are reportedly eyeing a last-minute deal for either Emi Martinez or Senne Lammens, meaning the record is likely to be broken with Mainoo’s departure - unless a new academy starlet suddenly emerges.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A 14-year-old goalscoring sensation by the name of JJ Gabriel has burst onto the scene at Manchester United, and fans are calling for the 'star boy' to be slotted into the first team as soon as possible. The young Red Devil stunned fans with his performance in the under-18s Premier League game on Saturday, where United triumphed 4-0 over Derby County.",
      "The teenager scored a 22-minute hat-trick, scoring in the fifth, 14th and 27th minutes to secure three goals before the half-hour mark of the game. Amir Ibragimov, 17, grabbed the other goal via a penalty in the 66th minute, but all anybody could talk about was the young Gabriel.",
      "Fans took to social media to hail the young forward's performance at the weekend, with one claiming he will become United's new star boy after Alejandro Garnacho's departure for Chelsea. They said: \"Chelsea took our egotistic Garnacho away, but La Carrington is cooking another starboy, his name is JJ Gabriel, bagged a hat-trick today. He’s just 14!\"",
      "Another said: \"How did I forget my star boy JJ Gabriel? Invest your stocks now!\" while a third added: \"JJ Gabriel has a hat-trick in 27 minutes for Manchester United Under 18's against Derby. He is 14 years old. Protect him at all costs.\"",
      "With more calls for the Old Trafford hierarchy to \"protect\" the young player at the club, it seems that these protests have been heard by the top brass. Gabriel committed his future to United this summer, as per Sports Illustrated, and is set to stay at Old Trafford until he is 16 years old - when he can sign a professional deal with the club.",
      "As reported earlier this month, the youngster, dubbed 'Kid Messi', will be permitted to train with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad at points throughout the season to bed him into the top level of football and has already been called up.",
      "Technical director Jason Wilcox is understood to have taken an active role in convincing the teenager to stay at United after he met with boss Amorim at the training ground in an effort to make him feel more part of the team.",
      "While it isn't a new thing for academy players to train with the first team - and sometimes graduate early to be a crucial part of the starting XI - the fact Gabriel is already making waves at just 14 suggests his ceiling could be incredibly high.",
      "Gabriel will, however, not be part of United's quest to win the FA Youth Cup this season as players have to be born before the cut-off date of 31 August 2010.",
      "Gabriel, who is the son of former Republic of Ireland international, Joe O'Cearuill, has scored five goals in three appearances for the under-18s team so far this season, including the hat-trick against Derby and goals against Middlesbrough and Everton.",
      "Last season, the youngster scored three goals in three appearances, catching the eye of many with his flair, skill and striking ability at such a young age.",
      "Some United fans have even likened him to Barcelona's Lamin Yamal, as one excited supporter wrote: \"JJ Gabriel is a different level of talent. Man Utd must try to keep him at all costs. Can see why Barcelona want him, could a be LW version of Yamal in future.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another added: \"I really hope that we can hold onto JJ Gabriel - he looks amazing and is only 14. There is a lot of chatter that he may move on. As he's an Irish passport holder, he could join the likes of Barcelona now.\"",
      "Due to Gabriel's holding of an Irish passport, the 14-year-old would be allowed to make the move to a European club from the age of 16 rather than 18 years old - tempting the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and even Bayern Munich, according to Goal.com.",
      "But with his United deal signed and his prowess showing in a league far above his age, Gabriel may just be the wonderkid the Old Trafford faithful could be seeing a lot more of in the years to come.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "As we career towards transfer deadline day, Premier League clubs face a race against time to get their final deals over the line. We've already seen plenty of huge transfers, from Liverpool's record-breaking Florian Wirtz swoop to long-awaited moves for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko, but there's still more work to be done.",
      "Indeed, injuries over the weekend have left some clubs wondering if they might need to dip back into the market. Liam Delap is set to miss a few weeks for Chelsea, while Manchester United are sweating on both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",
      "Clubs in England's top tier have until September 1 to get any new signings confirmed. It's the same across Europe's major leagues, including La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy and the German Bundesliga.",
      "There will still be a chance to get sales done after that, with the Saudi Pro League window remaining open until September 10 and the Turkish Super Lig wrapping up one day after that. Clubs will also be able to sign free agents outside the window, providing they were without a club by deadline day.",
      "Hincapie's Arsenal switch looks all but done, and is likely to be the Gunners' final new signing. The move is set to be a loan with a view to a permanent move next summer - worth around £45million.",
      "The Ecuador defender will be an option for his new club at centre-back or left-back. He was an unused substitute for Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday as they threw away a 3-1 lead to draw with 10-man Werder Bremen.",
      "Hincapie's arrival in North London is due to be accompanied by an exit for Jakub Kiwior. The Poland international is set to join Porto on loan, with an obligation to move to the Dragao next summer.",
      "By selling Garnacho on Saturday, Manchester United drew a line under one of this summer's big transfer sagas. More could follow, with Real Betis' stand-off over Antony persisting, while Hojlund's Napoli switch is drawing closer.",
      "Danish striker Hojlund has been sidelined by the arrival of Sesko, and it has become clear he isn't part of Ruben Amorim's first-team plans. AC Milan were linked earlier in the window, but Napoli are now poised to win the race and offer him Champions League football.",
      "The Serie A holders will bring Hojlund in on loan, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season. He arrived in Italy over the weekend with an announcement looking imminent.",
      "United's main priority, after strengthening their front-line before the start of the season, is to add a new goalkeeper to their ranks. Altay Bayindir has started in the league so far, with Andre Onana between the sticks in the Carabao Cup, but neither has convinced.",
      "Belgian stopper Senne Lammens and Aston Villa star Emi Martinez appear to be the leading contenders. Martinez would be the choice if Premier League experience is the main goal, with Lammens the younger model with a high ceiling.",
      "Galatasaray have also been linked with Lammens, who has missed Antwerp's last two league matches. However, the Turkish side could yet end up bringing in Ederson from Manchester City.",
      "The big one for much of the window, Isak's move is drawing closer. Newcastle have a new record signing after Nick Woltemade's £65m arrival from Stuttgart, though they may still need a second new forward before allowing Isak to leave.",
      "Sweden star Isak was absent again on Saturday, while Woltemade watched from the stands away at Leeds. A second blank in two away games emphasised the Magpies' need for reinforcements up top, but it looks like a return for Isak won't form part of that plan.",
      "Last season's top scorer has made it clear he feels his future lies away from St James' Park. A league record bid from Liverpool - surpassing the £120m including add-ons which Newcastle knocked back earlier in the window - can still do the trick.",
      "Isak made his case earlier in the window with a bold social media statement, and now Wissa has done the same. Newcastle have been targeting the Brentford star, and he appears to feel suitable offers have already arrived.",
      "“I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways,\" Wissa wrote on Instagram.",
      "“Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\"",
      "Aside from the Isak deal, Liverpool have work to do in defence. Giovanni Leoni has joined from Parma, but Crystal Palace captain Guehi would add a level of experience which the young Italian lacks.",
      "Guehi played 90 minutes in Europe on Thursday as Palace continue using the England international as normal while waiting for a resolution. Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has spoke of the challenge of finding a replacement, despite links with Manuel Akanji, but Guehi's contract situation could yet force the London club's hand.",
      "“From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,”Glasner said. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.”",
      "Jackson had been all set to join Bayern on loan, even jetting out to Germany. An injury to Delap has left the striker's Chelsea exit in the balance, though, despite protests from his agent, Diomansy Kamara.",
      "Senegal forward Jackson, who hasn't featured for Chelsea this season, remains keen on a move to the Bundesliga. A loan with an obligation or a straight purchase - rather than the agreed loan with an option - could yet see the deal completed.",
      "If Chelsea do still allow Jackson to leave, Delap's injury is expected to force them into the market for a new striker of their own. One of the names being mentioned is Conrad Harder, who averaged a goal or assist every 92 minutes last season while serving as Viktor Gyokeres' back-up at Sporting CP.",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt insists the players are firmly behind under-fire boss Ruben Amorim and want him to stay. The immediate pressure eased on Amorim with Saturday's dramatic 3-2 win over Burnley, which came courtesy of a 97th-minute penalty from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That was United's first win of the season and it came on the back of their humiliating EFL Cup penalty shootout exit to League Two Grimsby in midweek. That upset turned up the heat on Amorim, but De Ligt said the players have faith in their head coach and admitted they must take much of the blame for their poor start to the season.",
      "Asked if United's players want Amorim to stay, De Ligt said: “Yeah, of course. I mean, as a player, you're responsible for the results. They always speak about the manager, obviously, but I think as players we also looked each other in the eye after Grimsby and said to each other, ‘Guys, the performance of this week is not acceptable’.",
      "“It will be really, I think, bad to say that it’s the manager’s fault. It's mostly us and we know that. So yeah, obviously we still stand behind him, and he stands behind us, so we keep going like that. I think the result for today makes that feeling even more.”",
      "United face two massive tests when they return following the international break, with a trip to local rivals Manchester City followed by a showdown with Chelsea at Old Trafford. “I think the only thing that counted today was a win,” De Ligt added.",
      "“Everybody saw how. We know we could have done that better, but the win was the most important thing. I don't think there's much been said [since the Grimsby game] because everybody knows how the feeling was.",
      "“I think everybody from outside could also understand what the feeling is if you lose a game like that. So, yeah, it's not easy. We know that. We were really disappointed, in ourselves especially, so then to win was I think the only cure that could a little bit help the defeat of Wednesday.",
      "“We had a lot of big chances in the first-half and we didn't score all of them, but we created a lot of big chances. I think we conceded just one shot from Hannibal [Mejbri], so that was really good.",
      "“The only thing is that the game is 90 minutes, today even more, so that's something that we have to improve on. But as I said, the only thing that counted was a win, so with that I'm really happy. If you win, that's the best feeling, and we did.”",

      "Burnley co-owner JJ Watt was not a happy man after Manchester United claimed a last-gasp win over the Clarets on Saturday. Bruno Fernandes scored from the penalty spot deep into added time, after Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony had dragged the visitors back in contention.",
      "Anthony went from hero to villain as he was penalised for a tug back on Amad. The foul was missed in real time, but awarded after a VAR check.",
      "While the winger definitely had hold of Amad's shirt, Watt's issue concerned where the foul had taken place. \"It was outside the box…\" he argued on social media, though the officials felt contact had continued into the penalty area.",
      "A number of fans disagreed with the former NFL star, who has been a minority owner at Turf Moor since 2023. \"Even if pulling starts outside the box but continues inside the box then it’s a penalty,\" one said.",
      "\"Ended inside the box. Think that’s the rule on shirt tugging,\" wrote a second. A third, meanwhile, argued United should have had a penalty earlier in the match after a clash between Kyle Walker and Mason Mount, with VAR overturning on-field referee's decision on that occasion.",
      "Burnley manager Scott Parker also voiced frustrations after the late penalty award. “In the modern day and the way football is these days, it’s become very sterile,\" he said.",
      "“That’s the way the game has gone - multiple checks of every single second and phase. It is what it is but of course we’re hugely frustrated and disappointed with how the game has ended.”",
      "Burnley have lost both away games in the league but this was a closer-run thing than their opening day reverse at Tottenham. South Africa striker Foster got off the mark for the season after scoring five times in the Clarets' last Premier League campaign, but he too was left frustrated by the manner of his team's defeat.",
      "“I'm disappointed for the game to end the way it ended,\" Foster said. \"I feel like we deserved something from the game, for it to end in that way I think it was a bit unjust. It is what it is, unfortunate. We played really well, and I think we can be proud of that.”",
      "The striker, who also had a goal disallowed for offside, added: “I’m grateful to have scored and more than anything for the performance by the team. That’s why I feel like it stings so much to walk away with nothing.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has thrown his support behind Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and urged fans to stay positive. The ex-Red Devils defender hopes some harsh words were exchanged and fines dished out following the club's FA Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following their unfortunate opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal, many anticipated a transformed United squad, boosted by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, would build on their 15th-place finish from the previous campaign. Yet Amorim's troops have struggled from the off, with alarm bells ringing after their 1-1 stalemate with Fulham.",
      "Days following that outcome, in what proved a monumental shock, they crashed out of the FA Cup on spot-kicks to Grimsby. Come Saturday, a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes spot-kick spared them from another deflating display, as they edged past Burnley 3-2, temporarily silencing speculation about boss Amorim facing the axe.",
      "Ferdinand, who turned out 455 times for the Red Devils, weighed in on demands for Amorim's dismissal prior to the Burnley encounter. Whilst he called for confrontation in the changing room, jokingly admitting he'd expect some financial penalties, the 46-year-old firmly backed Amorim and stayed hopeful about the Portuguese boss's reign.",
      "\"I'm hoping that in the changing room, he [Amorim] has had some choice words with those players, someone's been strangled, someone's been put in a headlock, someone's been fined,\" Ferdinand began, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents channel.",
      "\"I'd like to think there's been some really, really solid hard conversations had, almost fights. I don't mind a fight, have one. Because I think moments like that, when it's on edge, when emotions are running high, when people are feeling embarrassed.",
      "\"There's been a lot of people talking, saying 'Oh, Ruben Amorim, give him the sack now.' Before a ball was kicked, everyone was optimistic, and I'm the same. Optimistic and hopeful. I'm hopeful that we're gonna improve.",
      "\"You can't sack someone after three games; it doesn't make sense,\" he continued, speaking before the Burnley win. \"You've allowed them to invest in three new strikers, and you're going to say after three games, when they're not even fully fit, that you're going to sack someone.",
      "\"It doesn't make sense to me. I don't see INEOS doing that. No way. I can't see it. They're more sensible than that. There are emotional people who pay good, hard-earned money who deserve to be entertained and deserve better performances and results. I get that.",
      "\"We all feel like that. But let's not be stupid. Let's not jump on the bandwagon and start getting all emotional about it, and say 'Right, I'm gonna start a vendetta.'",
      "\"Yes, there have been bad results, but when you try to turn things around at football clubs, especially one the size of Manchester United, that's been in turmoil and on a downward spiral for many years now, 10 or 12 years, do you think it's going to take six months or a year to turn that around? No. If we just keep changing managers every six months or every year, it's going to be the same thing for the next twenty years.\"",
      "Plenty have questioned Amorim's approach and relentless deployment of attacking wing-backs, but Ferdinand refuses to accept any criticism of the manager's reluctance to alter his formation, as he continued: \"The formation has been an issue for a lot of people. 'Should there be some flexibility in that?'",
      "\"But this manager will tell you, 'Yeah, we may start with three at the back. But there are moments in the game that we are playing four at the back, and we're shifting round.' It changes in terms of shape in and out of possession.",
      "\"I think you've got to allow the club to go through a period of pain if we feel there's a chance to get through the other side, and you're gonna see some sunlight. If you're allowing the manager to spend the money that we have, allowing him to let people go, then there has to be an element of patience through turmoil, and that's where we are right now.\"",
      "After a challenging few days, Amorim's squad managed to finish the week positively following a narrow three-point haul against Burnley. Despite relinquishing a one-goal advantage on two occasions, Fernandes rose to the occasion in the final moments to convert the decisive penalty and secure the club's maiden triumph of the campaign 3-2.",
      "\"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" the United boss revealed. When questioned whether these were lengthy concerns, he responded: \"I don't know, I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United will be active in the transfer market on the final day of the summer window.",
      "The window opened at the beginning of June before briefly closing due to the Club World Cup. United have conducted the majority of their business, but there is still work to do on the final day.",
      "The deadline is 7pm today, which is a four-hour shift from the traditional 11pm closure.",
      "Here are the deals United could complete on transfer deadline day:",
      "Lammens has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. The goalkeeper has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Galatasaray have been linked with a move for the Belgian shot-stopper ahead of the deadline.",
      "United admire Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who could be a potential alternative to Lammens, but the Argentina international earns £200,000 per week at Villa Park.",
      "United did not budget for the signing of a first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has watched Altay Bayindir make mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby and made an error for their second goal.",
      "At the time of writing, Rasmus Hojlund's move to Napoli has yet to be confirmed. He is leaving on a season-long loan, with the obligation to make it permanent included.",
      "United will receive a €6million (£5.2m) loan fee for Hojlund and €44m (£38m) next summer when the obligation, which depends on certain conditions, is triggered.",
      "Hojlund will reunite with Scott McTominay at the Italian champions.",
      "Will Antony complete his transfer to Real Betis? The Brazilian has held out for a move to Betis all summer after his loan last season, but the Spanish club have struggled to finance a deal.",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "It seemed like a deal was already agreed last Friday. Reports indicated a bid had been accepted and the terms of a permanent transfer had been agreed, but Betis released a formal statement saying: \"Betis has retired its offer. Betis cannot afford a transfer fee, nor the amounts the player is supposed to receive.\"",
      "It feels like there could be another twist with Antony and Betis before the transfer deadline.",
      "Last month, Roma contacted United to discuss a loan move for Sancho with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italians could not agree on personal terms with the winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic with his expectations for his next destination.",
      "United shifted Sancho at the eleventh hour last summer and it could go down to the wire again.",
      "Malacia recently celebrated his 26th birthday and interest has been sparse following his loan with PSV, but Spanish club Elche have been credited with late interest in the Dutch defender.",
      "Zachary Baumann is set to leave on a permanent transfer before the deadline, while Sam Mather could be on the move (potentially permanently) after attracting interest.",
      "Ethan Ennis is set to leave on loan - there is a choice between Fleetwood Town and Plymouth - and Rhys Bennett should head out. Ethan Williams completed a loan move to Falkirk on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Harry Amass is set to complete a season-long loan move to Sheffield Wednesday.",

      "United's current first and second choice goalkeepers, Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, have proven themselves not to be reliable options.",
      "Both have produced a number of error-strewn displays during their time at the club and both have been culpable for goals already this season that have cost United.",
      "Bayindir flapped badly at Declan Rice's corner in United's opening game of the season against Arsenal to allow Riccardo Calafiori to head home the simplest of goals. United were largely the better team but were punished by a bad goalkeeping error.",
      "Onana then followed suit against Grimsby where he was at fault for both goals as the League Two side dumped United out in the second round of the League Cup.",
      "In the Premier League, United's performances have largely been positive. But unless they make a change in goal, they will continue to drop points.",

      "Aston Villa are also said to be sniffing around Lammens and a move to Villa Park could well open the door for United to make a sensational last minute move for Emiliano Martinez.",
      "No matter which direction United go in, it should make for an exciting final few hours of the window. But they also have to ensure they get their decision right after fully revamping their goalkeeper department under Erik ten Hag and getting it badly wrong.",
      "Despite the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon this summer, a new goalkeeper would be their most important signing of the summer.",

      "With the transfer window closing on Monday evening at 7pm BST, the Reds are understood to be looking for a new goalkeeper. Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens and Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez are both on their radar.",
      "A move is likely to cast further uncertainty over the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir. United had also been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper now appears set for Manchester City.",
      "Several exits could also be sanctioned with Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund all potentially completing moves away from Old Trafford.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Negotiations over Jadon Sancho joining Aston Villa will reportedly continue today.",
      "The journalist Fabrizio Romano claims it would be a separate deal to any move for Emiliano Martinez, despite both being part of the same discussions as United try to agree on both moves. Sancho still has to decide his future.",
      "The deal for Antony is reportedly worth £19million plus £2.6million.",
      "The journalist Ben Jacobs also claims that the sell-on clause is 50%-net, so only any profit Real Betis make should they make from any future sale. As reported by The Athletic earlier, United will not subsidise the player's wage drop.",
      "Emi Martinez has reportedly told Aston Villa he wants to join United.",
      "The journalist Fabrizio Romano claims that the message was made clear again after their 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace last night, in which Martinez did not feature. United are already said to have an agreement on personal terms.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are still said to expect Gianluigi Donnarumma will join Manchester City.",
      "The Athletic, however, stop short of reporting that there is any agreement in place for Ederson yet, unlike Fabrizio Romano. They still describe that as a potential deal worth around £12million that City are ready to sanction.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma seemingly will sign for Manchester City today, with there now said to be a verbal agreement in place for Ederson to join Fenerbahce.",

      "United are said to have agreed with Real Betis over a permanent move for Antony.",
      "The Athletic reports that the winger will not receive a termination payment. Their deal is worth almost £22million and includes a 50% sell-on clause. Betis initially wanted a loan, but the clubs have now compromised.",
      "Good morning, United fans! Transfer deadline day is finally here, and it looks like being a busy one for the club.",

      "Raheem Sterling traded one London club for another in a last-minute switch in 2024, paving the way for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to make his escape to Chelsea.",
      "The previous year's deadline day was rife with Premier League surprises, with the Blues' dramatic transfer activity making plenty of headlines. Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal and United saw Sancho and Sterling relocate to different parts of London on loan for the new season.",
      "As the transfer window closed, the Blues issued a brief statement confirming Sterling's departure that read: \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger, who is now back at Stamford Bridge and has since turned 30, completed a last-minute loan move to the Emirates Stadium. This occurred after it became apparent that he was not in manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club over the summer.",
      "Chelsea welcomed another new face to their squad: former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially replaced Sterling. The England international had also been left out of then-manager Erik ten Hag's plans at United and was free to leave either on loan or permanently.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the young forward's preferred destination, with Chelsea agreeing to an obligatory purchase price of £23million if certain targets were achieved.",
      "This was a stark contrast to the hefty £73.5m that the club shelled out in the summer of 2021 to entice Sancho to Manchester.",
      "However, his performances at Old Trafford were underwhelming. He scored only 12 goals and provided six assists in 83 appearances, causing his value to plummet significantly.",
      "In the meantime, Sterling found himself back with an old acquaintance at Arsenal; manager Mikel Arteta, who had spent considerable time working under Pep Guardiola during Sterling's seven-year stint with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, regardless of his impact at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "During his spell at Arsenal, the forward scored just once and provided five assists in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League.",
      "Sterling was used sparingly but arguably had his best match when he assisted Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice in a 2-2 draw against PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's premier competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but he ultimately ended the season without any trophies and rarely played before returning to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sancho had a standout year with Chelsea, netting five goals and providing 10 assists across 41 appearances in domestic and European competitions. The young winger's most notable performances came in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Conference League.",
      "After reaching the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund during his loan spell in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho found himself in another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, where they triumphed over the Spanish side in a resounding 4-1 victory, with Sancho scoring the third goal in the 83rd minute.",
      "Despite his contributions to their trophy-winning campaign, Chelsea chose to pay a fee to United to avoid triggering Sancho's buyout clause, seemingly unconvinced by the winger's performances.",
      "Sancho now finds himself part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still attempting to facilitate a move for the winger who doesn't feature in the Portuguese manager's future plans.",
      "Sancho has already rejected offers from Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly on the radar of several clubs, while Sterling also finds himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea. With both players in precarious positions at their respective clubs, there's every possibility they could be involved in another dramatic deadline day move but will no doubt hope to make a greater impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",

      "Chido Obi recently removed Manchester United from his bio on Instagram.",
      "The removal of the club's name could be completely insignificant, but followers of the academy have suggested it could be a hint at frustration with a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "The best way to respond to that disappointment is to score for the academy and Obi notched his second goal of the campaign to open the scoring against Manchester City Under-21s.",
      "The Manchester clubs clashed at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday afternoon, which felt like the appetiser for the proper Manchester derby at the Etihad following the international break.",
      "Maybe Obi thought throughout the summer that he would have a chance of being involved in such occasions this season. The youngster made eight first-team appearances last term, he outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the post-season trip and travelled to the United States for pre-season.",
      "Obi started against Leeds in Stockholm and made a further two appearances from the bench in the USA, but Ruben Amorim has not named the young striker in any of his matchday squads this season.",
      "The 17-year-old must earn his stripes for first-team involvement. He made a strong impression last term in difficult circumstances, but it was obvious that he still had a long way to go with his development.",
      "Obi may look at Max Dowman (15) and Ethan Nwaneri (18) at his former club Arsenal and notice that Mikel Arteta has permanently promoted both of those players to his senior squad.",
      "Every situation is different, and Obi must knuckle down to impress Amorim with his performances for the U21s. He struggled to get involved for large parts of the first half against City in the mini-Manchester derby and received an earful from the newly appointed assistant manager, David Horseman.",
      "\"Go on Chido, inside shoulder,\" Horseman shouted at one stage to encourage Obi to press his opponent. Obi was drifting through the contest, but showed just before half-time why he is such a talent.",
      "Obi pounced on Divine Mukasa's indecision around the City penalty area. The youngster still had work to do, but impressively skipped into the box to finish brilliantly beyond City goalkeeper Jack Wint.",
      "Strikers who are worth their salt only need a single chance to finish and Obi has admirable instincts in the box. Some players must work tirelessly on their finish technique, but it comes naturally to Obi.",
      "United were fortunate to have a 1-0 advantage by the interval. City created excellent chances in the first 30 minutes, but couldn't find a breakthrough and their wastefulness was punished.",
      "\"Why did he shoot so early,\" City manager Ben Wilkinson vented on the touchline when Justin Oboavwoduo failed to keep his cool after a poor back pass from Jaydan Kamason.",
      "Wilkinson looked understandably disappointed as he returned to the dressing room for the break. City couldn't make their dominance count and the momentum shift continued when play resumed again.",
      "United were hugely improved at the beginning of the second half, seemingly energised following a discussion with Binnion. Sam Mather came close to scoring on the left and James Scanlon's shot flashed inches wide.",
      "Then Shea Lacey was introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald to make his first U21 appearance. The supremely talented youngster almost made an immediate impact with a volley from the edge of the box, but it was saved.",
      "City counter-attacked moments later to equalise through Reigan Heskey. Both sons of Emile Heskey started for City, while Darren Fletcher's twins started for United, which was a subplot to make fans feel old.",
      "Binnion reacted by introducing Amir Ibragimov. The youngster played a full 90 minutes for the Under-18s on Saturday and was not only fine to play again - but scored the match winner.",
      "Lacey played a wonderful cross into the box to find Ibragimov at the back post to wrap up an impressive Manchester derby victory. United fans will be hoping for the same result when the first-team play after the break.",

      "The then-36-year-old was heavily linked with a switch to local rivals Manchester City. However, the Red Devils made a last-minute hijack with Juventus and Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, while club icons Sir Alex Ferguson and Rio Ferdinand rang the player to put him off of joining City.",
      "What ensued was a shock announcement that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner had seemingly performed a U-turn to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad – 12 years after his departure for Real Madrid, where he went on to establish himself as one of the all-time greats. For many supporters, it signified the dream homecoming and symbolised a return to the old United, which had sorely been missing since Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Ronaldo's spectacular move came with an initial price tag of £13million, but totalled £38m when considering the £385,000-a-week he earned over the subsequent 64 weeks he spent in Manchester.",
      "Despite being a hefty sum for a player in his mid-30s, it still represented a wage cut from the £500,000-per-week he had been pocketing at Juve.",
      "Quite simply, supporters were unconcerned as they rushed to have the Portuguese superstar's name printed on the back of their 2021/22 shirts in a flurry of excitement. A thrilling United under club legend Solskjaer had secured second place the previous campaign, and now they were bringing in football's most deadly goalscorer.",
      "Ronaldo commented following the confirmation of his transfer, as he said: \"Manchester United is a club that has always had a special place in my heart, and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I have received since the announcement on Friday.",
      "\"I cannot wait to play at Old Trafford in front of a full stadium and see all the fans again. I'm looking forward to joining up with the team after the international games, and I hope we have a very successful season ahead.\"",
      "Having originally signed at Old Trafford in 2003, Ronaldo transformed himself from a promising talent into a global superstar during the following six years, finding the net over 100 times for the Red Devils and helping United claim three Premier League titles, along with the Champions League.",
      "Following his comeback, he reclaimed his legendary No. 7 jersey and found the net on his second debut against Newcastle. Further strikes came as he managed 24 across all competitions, though his contributions proved futile as United battled poor form and Solskjaer received his marching orders early in his first season back.",
      "Ronaldo endured two interim bosses that campaign, in Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick, as his frustration with the club's decline became increasingly apparent. The Portuguese superstar allegedly tried to orchestrate a departure but was unsuccessful before the window closed, with United blocking his exit.",
      "Erik ten Hag's arrival as permanent manager in the summer of 2022 offered the possibility of a clean slate, until it emerged that the Dutchman wouldn't grant his experienced striker any special privileges. The veteran was left out of the Manchester derby loss to local rivals Manchester City, sparking widespread debate.",
      "Ten Hag insisted he kept Ronaldo on the substitutes' bench \"out of respect\" as United trailed 4-0 at the interval. He subsequently asked Ronaldo to enter as a replacement three minutes before the conclusion of the win over Tottenham, which the forward declined to do.",
      "Ronaldo subsequently marched down the tunnel and departed Old Trafford before the final whistle - a decision he later acknowledged regretting. Ten Hag reacted to that outburst by excluding him for one match before naming Ronaldo as captain for the following four encounters.",
      "Nevertheless, Ronaldo's decision was already made. Prior to the 2022 World Cup, he participated in an explosive interview with close ally Piers Morgan, in which he criticised both Ten Hag and former boss Rangnick.",
      "The striker claimed he had been \"betrayed\" by United and also alleged Ten Hag had attempted to push him out of the club.",
      "United reacted by cancelling his contract, clearing the path for his transfer to his current side, Al-Nassr, in January 2023, and concluding one of the club's most significant and thrilling signings ever on a bitter note.",

      "It's deadline day and Manchester United are expecting a busy final day in the transfer window. Ruben Amorim's men got the majority of their business done earlier in the summer but there are still alarm bells ringing at Old Trafford.",
      "After three games, United have won one, drew one and lost one in the Premier League. Last week, they crashed out of the EFL Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are showing glimpses of what they can do but Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact. Now, with less than 24 hours of the window remaining, United are searching for a final addition.",
      "A new midfielder could still be added to Amorim's squad with Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller being linked with a move to the Premier League. According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Stuttgart chiefs are currently discussing whether or not to sell the player.",
      "Mason Mount's injury against Burnley and uncertainty over Kobbie Mainoo's future means a move for Stiller could be on the cards.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"After the first four games of the season, some would argue that a new midfielder is the priority for United over a goalkeeper. Casemiro has struggled and Bruno Fernandes is just better further forward.",
      "\"Stiller is a player who has been linked previously but leaving it until the last few days may be too late. It seems as though United are gunning for a new goalkeeper meaning signing the midfielder is unlikely.",
      "\"However, if they can get it over the line, they will be strengthening a key area with a transfer no-one saw coming.\"",
      "Jadon Sancho has been included in talks between United and Aston Villa for Martinez. According to The Athletic, the possibility of including the winger in a deal that would see him move to Villa Park has been mentioned.",
      "Martinez missed Villa's 3-0 loss to Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid interest from United. The report states that talks are ongoing between the two clubs, as are discussions with Antwerp for Lammens.",
      "Sancho is expected to depart United today with a number of clubs keen.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Much has been made of United's need to sign a goalkeeper and midfielder before the window closes. But perhaps one of their most important pieces of business today is shifting players who do not have a future at the club.",
      "\"Sancho falls into that bracket alongside Antony and Tyrell Malacia. The worrying thing is that none of them are on the brink of joining new clubs. If United can sign Martinez and sell Sancho in the same deal, they will be delighted.\"",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt has thrown his backing behind head coach Ruben Amorim amid speculation over his future.",
      "United's League Cup elimination by fourth-tier Grimsby Town on Wednesday plunged the club into an early-season crisis but they recovered with a last-gasp 3-2 win against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "Odds on Amorim to leave United were shortened in midweek and the Portuguese admitted on Friday that \"sometimes I want to quit\", though United sources claimed that was tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Bruno Fernandes converted a 97th-minute penalty to secure United's first win of the campaign against promoted Burnley ahead of the September internationals. United resume their season at Manchester City on September 14.",
      "When asked if he hoped that Amorim would remain in charge, De Ligt replied: “Yeah, of course. I mean, as a player you are responsible for the results.",
      "\"They (outside the club) always speak about the manager, obviously, but I think as players we also looked each other in the eye after Grimsby and said to each other ‘guys, the performance of this week is not acceptable’. It will be really, I think, bad to say that it’s the manager’s fault. It's mostly us and we know that.",
      "\"So yeah, obviously we still stand behind him, and he stands behind us, so we keep going like that. I think the result for today makes that feeling even more.",
      "\"I don't think there's been much said (among the players) because everybody knows how the feeling was. I think everybody from outside could also understand what the feeling is if you lose a game like that.",
      "\"So, yeah, it's not easy. We know that. We were really disappointed, in ourselves especially, so then to win today was I think the only cure that could a little bit help the defeat of Wednesday.",
      "\"I find it quite good (playing under Amorim). I feel good, I feel physically good.\"",
      "United had 20 more attempts at goal than Burnley, who scored twice from six efforts until Jadon Anthony was penalised for tugging Amad's shirt inside the area in added time.",
      "Had Burnley held on, United would have failed to win any of their first three Premier League games for the first time since 2014.",
      "\"I think the only thing that counted today was a win,\" De Ligt added. \"Everybody saw how. We know we could have done that better, but the win was the most important thing.",
      "“I think pretty much that first half was really good. I think we had a lot of big chances. Obviously we had some and we didn't score all of them, but we created a lot of big chances. I think we conceded just one shot from the penalty spot from Hannibal, so that was really good.",
      "\"The only thing is that the game is 90 minutes, today even more, so that's something that we have to improve on. As I said, today the only thing that counted was a win so with that I am really happy.\"",
      "Fernandes missed from 12 yards in the 1-1 draw with Fulham last week but converted both kicks in the marathon shootout defeat at Grimsby before notching his 39th penalty goal for United against Burnley.",
      "“I couldn't do it, I think, as a penalty taker,\" De Ligt said of Fernandes' calmness. “Really happy with Bruno today that he stepped up to the penalty and that he scored a goal. It is really important for us.\"",

      "Leny Yoro",
      "As slick on the ball as the turf in the rainy conditions, doubtless helped by his midweek rest. Nowhere near Lyle Foster for the equaliser. 6",

      "Closed down Hannibal Mejbri quickly enough to ensure he did not have a clear shot at goal. Like his fellow centre halves, left Foster unmarked. 6",

      "The other defender not scarred from the Grimsby Town debacle, Shaw was urgent and drifted wide to double as a left back at times. 6",
      "Amad",
      "A huge improvement on his tentative midweek performance. Drove at Burnley constantly and came close to scoring from a corner. Faded after the pause but won the penalty. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "His header off the crossbar rebounded in off Cullen to give United the lead. A clear upgrade on Manuel Ugarte. Came off for Benjamin Sesko. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Regularly involved and teed up Amad for a volley at goal from a first-half corner. Booked for a needless sliding tackle as frustration got the better of him. Scored the added-time penalty. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Switched to the left wing at the expense of the dropped Patrick Dorgu and his movement infield gave United another outlet. Did well for Bryan Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "The best player on the pitch in the first half and so athletic he outpaced Kyle Walker. For the third August running, he got injured. Off at half-time. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "His first touch is one of the most delicate since Dimitar Berbatov's and Mbeumo went close to a first Old Trafford goal until he put United 2-1 up. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Forced off in the first half with a hamstring injury, having begun quite brightly as the de facto centre forward in United's strikerless system. 6",
      "Subs",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Had a good chance before half-time and played a key role in Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Has some brass neck to want out when he can't get in the worst United team in 51 years. Lackadaisical. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Went close with a header. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Returned from injury. 6",
      "Manager",
      "Made the right calls in the right positions and United were fluid again without a striker starting. Injuries disrupted United. 6",

      "The Slovenia striker did come on in the second period, replacing Casemiro with just under 20 minutes remaining. Amorim's handling of Sesko has also been a talking point this season. United paid big money to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig, but the striker has yet to start in a Premier League fixture.",

      "Manchester United needed a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes to see off Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The 3-2 victory over Scott Parker's team will come as some relief for Reds boss Ruben Amorim after Wednesday night's dismal League Cup exit to Grimsby Town. United were twice pegged back by the newly promoted Clarets but Reds captain Fernandes stepped up to net a late winner from the spot after Amad was fouled in the Burnley box.",
      "Amorim's men will now head into the international break and will return with daunting fixtures against rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. They then face kinder matches on paper against Brentford and Sunderland before a tough trip to Liverpool.",
      "Below is a look at what the national media had to say after United's win over Burnley.",
      "Will Unwin of The Guardian wrote: \"It is easy to see why Ruben Amorim has developed a love-hate relationship with his players after a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty controversially earned Manchester United’s first win of the season. The result should not have been in doubt but poor finishing and defending meant the hosts had to rely on the referee, Sam Barrott, to visit the pitchside monitor and overturn his own decision.",
      "\"Josh Cullen’s own goal gave United a deserved lead they should have built on but Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony were twice allowed to equalise either side of Bryan Mbeumo scoring United’s second in 11 chaotic second-half minutes. The match was heading for a draw until it was belatedly judged that Anthony had pulled down Amad Diallo and the United captain did the rest to send Old Trafford wild, while Burnley fumed. But once again, as at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Amorim did not watch the penalty.\"",
      "Jonathan Northcroft of The Times wrote: \"At least this time, Ruben Amorim didn’t cower; this time he faced the field, although still he couldn’t watch. He had his feet up, head back, and wore a queasy expression, raising his eyes towards the supporters, rather than train them on the pitch as Manchester United, once again, went to the penalty spot to try to save themselves from embarrassment.",
      "\"It was all there in the body language, how excruciating, how precarious, this young manager is still finding his job. It was also a million miles from Fergie, who would stand with that burning stare of his for ever fixed on his players. But these are different times, and in these times, for United, even beating Burnley is big.\"",
      "Charlotte Harpur of The Athletic wrote: \"After Wednesday’s 12-11 defeat on penalties by League Two Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, what Manchester United really needed was a straightforward victory against newly-promoted Burnley in the Premier League.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has completed his move from Manchester United to Chelsea.",
      "The winger was at Stamford Bridge to watch his new club beat Fulham in Saturday's early Premier League game and has wrapped up his £40million switch.",
      "Garnacho's move to Chelsea has been expected for most of the summer and the Blues have been long-term admirers of the 21-year-old.",
      "He joins on a seven-year-contract and the deal includes a 10 per cent sell on for United.",
      "After securing the switch Garnacho said: \"It;s an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club.",
      "\"I can't wait to get started. I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "The Argentina international moved to Old Trafford in 2020 as a 16-year-old and he helped the Reds win the FA Youth Cup in 2022.",
      "He broke through into the first-team the following season and seemed set for a bright future with the Reds.",
      "But he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and has been training away from the first-team this summer as part of the United 'bomb squad'.",
      "His departure will count as pure profit for United under the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) as Garnacho counts as a homegrown player.",
      "Garnacho cast doubt on his future after he was benched for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in May and Amorim told him three days later he could leave United.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby at City in December over his attitude in the 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Garnacho was then selected in the next 34 matchday squads before he was omitted from the 20-man selection on the final day of the season against Aston Villa.",
      "Garnacho started 25 times under Amorim - including in the six knockout ties before the Europa League final - but he was then ousted from the starting XI after Mason Mount scored twice in the semi-final second leg win against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Speaking about Garnacho earlier this year, Amorim said: \"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "Manchester United are reportedly preparing a surprise £40million offer for Aston Villa's goalkeeper Emi Martinez. The Reds had previously passed up the opportunity to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer, deeming the deal too costly when his £200,000-a-week wages were considered.",
      "Instead, United turned their attention to Royal Antwerp's highly sought-after young goalkeeper Senne Lammens, having outbid several top European competitors for his £20million signature. It was anticipated that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening's transfer deadline.",
      "The 23-year-old is viewed as the successor to Thibaut Courtois as Belgium's No. 1. However, United now appear ready to approve an expensive short-term solution with Martinez rather than plan for the future.",
      "Martinez, who turns 33 on Tuesday, has been seen as a risky investment due to his age and volatile temperament, prompting Villa to consider cashing in. United believe that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a risk they must take, despite the club already spending over £200million on new signings this summer and flirting with PSR problems, reports the Mirror.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim reportedly lacks confidence in £43m Andre Onana or Turkish back-up Altay Bayindir. Onana was dropped from United's team for the 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford following a shaky performance in the unexpected Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby in midweek.",
      "However, Bayindir, who was responsible for Fulham's equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last week, made another mistake when the Clarets equalised for a second time. Intriguingly, Villa themselves are attempting a last-minute deal to bring West Ham's Lucas Paqueta to the West Midlands.",
      "Unai Emery has been urging club officials to bolster his squad, but due to PSR issues, the Villans haven't been able to make the additions the Spaniard desired. However, having already profited from the sale of homegrown midfielder Jacob Ramsey, offloading Martinez in the next 36 hours will provide them with some financial relief moving forward, even as they aim to secure Paqueta.",
      "They've been in discussions about a loan move with a £50m transfer obligation next summer, and while the Brazilian international is eager for the move, West Ham aren't satisfied with the current terms.",
      "If Villa could pay more upfront and make the transfer permanent immediately, it would be beneficial. A new goalkeeper is also likely to join, although Emery might be content to let veteran stopper Marco Bizot take charge until January if they can't secure the replacement for Martinez they're after.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and even at this early stage, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names. Haaland is indeed the current joint leader, obviously alongside Lucas Paqueta, with 15 players on two goals each.",
      "A lot of them – no offence, Jurrien Timber – are nevertheless not that close to the top 10 favourites to still be top scorer in nine months’ time",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "You would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "Among the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "Not since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "One of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "Two fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "Has any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "Has made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "Faded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres, and a goal in the defeat to Brighton nudged him ahead in the race again.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an assist against Newcastle. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year."

      "It’s Nottingham Forest so of course one of the few unbeaten Premier League managers this season could get sacked. But at least he is now behind Graham Potter and Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",

Yes, he’s tall. Yes, he’s German. But we’ve all seen this movie before—and no, I’m not talking about the 2014 World Cup Final. I’m talking about **“The Obertan Illusion: Part Deux.”**",
      "This smells like what happened when Sir Alex Ferguson (usually a man of genius) decided that **Manucho**—a name that still haunts Old Trafford like a forgotten MySpace login—was going to be the next big thing. Tall? Check. Foreign? Check. Scored once in Angola? Triple check. Manucho had all the hype and none of the Premier League minutes. Sound familiar?",
      "Now, I’m not saying Woltemade will definitely follow in Manucho’s footsteps and disappear into a Bundesliga B team before we can finish pronouncing his name. But in the harsh light of Premier League reality, signing him to solve their goal-scoring crisis feels less like a bold footballing move and more like a deleted scene from 8½, where the director is spiralling into madness trying to find meaning in a striker with two career goals and the gait of a confused giraffe.",
      "Let me be clear: this isn’t anti-Woltemade propaganda. It’s just that Newcastle need a proven striker, not someone who sounds like he moonlights as a Berlin-based techno DJ on weekends.",
      "If the plan is to sign Nick Woltemade to “develop for the future,” then fine—but don’t pretend he’s the cavalry. That’d be like sending in a kazoo to back up the brass section. And let’s face it, if Nick really was the answer, we’d all be asking a much stranger question.",

Seeing players bursting a lung to chase down a nothing ball against United only to watch them amble around harmlessly a week later against Sunderland was really annoying.",
      "The Newcastle mentality from last week would probably be 5-0 up at half time Vs Leeds. Instead they’re drawing and look totally tame. United also have this problem. This is the reason elite players ultimately don’t want to stay. They have elite mentality and they’re at a club which doesn’t.

      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",

      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "Plenty of you believe Ruben Amorim should either resign or be sacked, with three replacements touted in the Mailbox, but he’s also not the problem in the minds of many, and as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s also a bit of Newcastle anger at Liverpool and some Champions League frustration, but this is indeed another Amorim, Manchester United edition.",
      "Send your thoughts on the Old Trafford mess or anything else to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "There’s something fundamentally wrong about the United spirit. It’s bigger than squad revamp, or structural development. It’s the psyche.\nIn the Fergie era, playing against a team with John O’Shea and Fredrico Macheda, you still held your breath, knowing that United were capable of springing up surprises.",
      "Since Fergie’s departure, there’s a kind of trepidation coaches face with managing the team. Every coach since then, has tried to pick out scapegoats responsible for dampening the team spirit and there’s been much talk on players who are hungry enough to win for the team. In spite of it, the sloppiness lingers. The team spirit remains lackadaisical. Players do the bare minimum with the only consistent player across several seasons being Fernades.",
      "The reason I adore Mourinho’s time with United is based on the simple fact he worked the boys to a Europa trophy. You could see the way some of the players limped towards their medals. He pushed them hard. It reminded of what it meant to play for Ferguson. You either worked your butt off or moved. Other coaches treat them as snowflakes.",
      "Amorim’s recent interview has shown he is not fit for the job. His morale is low. His drive, beaten up. He has not shown any sense of urgency by tweaking his formation. He is like the proverbial mad man doing the same thing over and again while expecting the same results.",
      "This is business, not a charity organization. If he can’t inspire this team, after ostracizing other players in his revamp, he should resign.\nVictor, Nigeria. Glory Glory Man Utd.",
      "",
      "What (the f..k) is wrong with MUFC? Your inbox is overflowing with vitriol, hand wringing and hundreds of different interpretations but I have YET to see one viable solution. We’ve changed owners, infrastructure, coaches, players, playing style and goodness knows what else yet nothing seems to have worked.",
      "Maybe, as someone (somewhat harshly) said, we’ve just reverted back to the mean, i.e. pre Fergie days, the days of Duxbury and Blackmore, or the 70’s team that got relegated, before we developed (or more accurately, marketed!) this rubbish about DNA. The media follows and scrutinizes every nuance (“his facial expressions look like he’s given up”) and former players constantly pound on about how things used to be. They remind me of the MAGA folk with their constant mantra of “Make United Great Again”. Let’s me honest, during the Fergie years, we were blessed, spoilt and damn lucky. A whole bunch of things came together at the same time. The stars were aligned. But WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT TO EVER BE THAT GOOD AGAIN. And this is the simple fact that everyone seems to be ignoring.",
      "The current owners suck every penny possible from the club while the players drive up in luxury cars.  I’m sure it’s a toxic place to work at the moment. We’ve had countless managers in the last few years. Does anyone seriously think a new manager is the solution? And as Amorin said, you can’t change all 22 players. “Open Heart Surgery”? This patient has flat lined.",
      "The only solution, as far as I can see, is to stick with Amorin and go down. This will shed the prima donnas and allow us to re-build with young, hungry youth who still think it is a privilege to play for the shirt (which ironically is what Amorin did at Sporting). Last season we were (un)lucky not to go down and just a few months later, Gary Neville thinks we will make the Top Four! Maybe a season or two out of the spotlight is about the only thing that hasn’t been tried. Then we will really see who wants to play for MUFC making JUST 50k a week!\nAdidasmufc (If it forced the Glazers to sell, it might even be worth it)",
      "",
      "So the Man Utd manager merry go round looks like it’s cranking up again right on time. I’d expect the players to come out and give another terrible performance against Burnley just to twist the knife and ensure there is no option but to sack Amorim. 2-0 or 3-1 to Burney I would guess with a goalkeeper howler the icing on the cake – probably an Olympico.",
      "Whether you want him to stay longer or not, like him or not, it is pretty ridiculous to blame the manager. Yet another high profile manager who has failed.",
      "So it must be the players then? According to Transfermkt we have the 5th most expensive squad in the league. And we were 5th last year too yet finished 15th. So it surely cannot be the quality of the players.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the players attitude is terrible and has been for a long time regardless of who is in charge. They do manage to pick themselves up for the big games and occasionally get a commendable draw to fool us into thinking there’s some hope. Attitude is not the players fault. Your attitude is driven by your compensation and working conditions. Clearly Utd players are extremely well compensated so even clearer is that their working conditions must be absolutely atrocious. Yes, it must be terrible to pick up 200 k per week to kick a ball about I hear you say. Grimsby players are happily kicking a ball about with smiles on their faces for significantly less money. So are most of the other teams in the premier league.",
      "So yeah, let’s just get a shiny new manager again, spend a few hundred million on his type of players and listen to the club bulshit us that they have a long term plan and that it will take a few transfer windows to fix. Don’t worry, we’ll win the league in three years time lads, we have a plan… does the 3 years start again with the new manager? Asking for a friend…",
      "The way the club is run, we deserve to be relegated but that still wouldn’t make those in charge stop and think that maybe it’s never been the pl;ayers or the manager, they’re just the easy targets of a club where so many senior club positions have seen well renowned people come and go with such regularity that clearly there is political fuck-tard-ery hapenning that is ruining the club from the inside. We have no right to think we should be title contenders every year but the amount of money the club has compared to the rest does mean that the current state of the club can only be caused by severe incompetenece at board level.\nJon, Cape Town (Get relegated, Glazers out, maybe we might win a few games in the Championship, especially if all our current players defect and we have to bring through our youth.

      "When Rúben Amorim walked into Manchester United, I’ll admit it: I let optimism in through the front door. Not blind optimism, not naïve giddiness, but a conscious decision on how to live life and how to relate to football. Supporting United, after all, isn’t just about results. It’s about how you choose to hold yourself through the cycles of joy and pain.",

      "Arsenal: Pleasure in the Pain",
      "A loss is a loss, and a title race probably died before it was ever born – but the performance brought more pleasure than pain. United played well. Fine margins swung the contest: VAR blessing Arsenal with a questionable goal, a penalty shout ignored, Dorgu’s shot pinging off the post, Raya standing tall in goal. There was enough there to feel alive again, to sense possibility.",
      "Fulham: A Half to Remember Against Fulham,",
      "Disappointment on paper but a bright first half. Cunha already looks like he could be sensational. Amorim nailed it in his analysis: United became too focused on holding onto the result rather than playing. That’s coaching clarity – an honesty I value more than lip service.",
      "Grimsby: oh God Grimsby! Goalkeepers and Perspective",
      "Then came Grimsby. What do you even say? The truth is simple: United need a goalkeeper. Hard to find, harder to bed in, but the difference it makes is night and day.And yet as bad as it was and jeez loueeeze Onana why! — United clawed back to 2-2, showed fight, and were a penalty away from advancing. Embarrassing? Of course. Defining? Not really. Ole reached semis and finals without winning them. Ten Hag delivered two trophies, but that wasn’t enough to make me shed a tear when he left. In fact i cheered. He was an odd man!  Football moves on.",
      "On Amorim",
      "Here’s the crux: I love Amorim. It could be another false dawn. He could be sacked tomorrow if results don’t turn. His post-Grimsby interview carried a chill that United fans know too well. But that doesn’t shake me.  Because how you support your club is personal. For me, it’s not about playing small or coy. I grew up in the glory days. I will die on the hill that football is cyclical, and United will be back. Juventus were relegated, came back, and won multiple titles. Why should Manchester United be any different?So yes, results are awful. Amorim’s future is uncertain. But Manchester United aren’t a pity project. We’re a behemoth, and behemoths rise. Sunnier days will come.",

Once he’s finally jettisoned from the Ibrox hot seat he’ll hopefully never darken the door of a dugout ever again.",
      "Without going into detail about our inevitably pathetic start to this season under Martin (because I know that know one is bothered about Scottish football other than Johnny Nic), I wanted to touch on the strangely similar fates of Rangers and Man Utd, two former perennial league challengers who suffered equally if slightly different humiliations on Wednesday night.",
      "Both clubs emerged as the dominant force in their countries in the 90s, both big spenders who could pick and choose who they wanted and hoovered up trophy after trophy, becoming the panto villains of their leagues. Then in the 2000s, both were suddenly pegged back by domestic challenges – in Scotland from a Larsson-inspired O’Neill side and from Wenger/Mourinho respectively in England. The trophies weren’t as easy to come by in this decade though both clubs did manage 3 titles in a row amongst some other great moments.",
      "Then the wheels come off. For Rangers this is 2012, admin, relegation to the Scottish third division and a painful and mind-numbing climb back up to the top flight. For United, 2013 and the retirement of Fergie. Obviously their 2010s weren’t as totally abject but it’s clearly when the rot set in.",
      "Since then both clubs have had little glimmers of hope – the odd trophy, a league title for Rangers, both have reached EL finals – but currently both find themselves with unwanted and disliked ‘system’ managers with neither the players to play these systems, nor the ability to coach them.",
      "Maybe they’re still the clubs which best represent the UK in 2025. Both fallen giants, one with a huge global reach but with supporters who must be wondering why they should still bother to respect their adopted club, the other undone by financial mismanagement and dodgy tax practices. Both currently owned by Americans.",
      "So what lies in store for these two 90s giants? Do we sit tight and await the arrival of some sort of new generational manager to rescue us? Hope that our rivals fail so badly as to allow us to catch up? What does it mean when the classic glory-hunter clubs stop achieving glory?",

      "As my mail a week back, when United were still riding the high of the Arsenal draw, already said: Amorim is a goner.",
      "1. Tactical inflexibility. His formation doesn’t suit the squad and actually makes good players worse by forcing them into bad roles. He insists on two in midfield — but in the Premier League, you need two cyborgs to cover that ground. Cyborgs don’t exist yet.",
      "2. The Bruno dilemma. Amorim didn’t have the guts to move on from Bruno at the pivotal moment when the money could have been reinvested. Instead, the team remains unbalanced around him.",
      "3. Favoritism over competition. He preaches competition but picks his favourites regardless of form. That’s how you lose the dressing room — just ask Ten Hag or Solskjaer.",
      "4. The “donut guy” effect. Amorim is the classic office donut guy: bad at his job but really nice, so people look the other way. He gives media and YouTubers open access, which shields him from proper criticism.",
      "All in all, he’s finished. The real worry is what comes next. The United hierarchy will panic and swing back towards a “local” man-manager type — Gareth Southgate territory — and we’ll end up with another Maguire contract to show for it.",
      "Mark my words.",
      "Kind regards,\nMike",
      "",
      "For such a big fellow, Andre Onana sure has weak hands, and everybody knows it now. Will he leave at a deep discount after a loan ot three, or grimly run his contract down? And is Amorim as done as he looks, or is ownership paralyzed by the investments they’ve made in him — i.e., the good players he’s discarded and/or demoralized, some of whom have already been sold at significant losses, and the dubious players he’s brought in for his 343 master plan that’s, honestly, *this close to clicking. I’m rather hoping it’s the latter, because I’d be quite keen to see Kobbie Mainoo in black and white. I do think that Manchester United supporters should keep faith in Mbeumo and Sesko, though.

While I watched, I was almost always angry at what your lot got away with; I’ll spare you the list, of which I hope you have been made aware by now. That said, it wasn’t all one-way. We got away with a few bad fouls, too, and nobody is complaining about Gordon’s red card (except at Gordon himself). We can all do with being less one-eyed.

      "And irritatingly, we had that same kind of state when we appointed Ole to replace the toxicity of Jose. Straightforward talk, good mood, players responded and we came close to success. Yes, both managers lack tactical knowledge but we can see what supposed tactical experts deliver.",
      "That said, sometimes sacking the manager is still the right thing. Moyes was out of his depth, had entirely the wrong attitude. And while his backing such as it was made headlines for all the wrong reasons, he also could fall back on a squad that had just won the league. Aging, sure, but obviously capable. We can definitely agree that it set the tone for the utter dismantling of everything that had been built.",
      "Ole was also shafted by the board deciding unilaterally to sign Ronaldo even though he wasn’t needed or wanted by the manager. He completely destabilised the team that was seeming to be coming together. He might have even got something out of Sancho, because there’s a lad that needs an arm round the shoulder not being shouted at. He did choose to sign Maguire though, so he’ll always have that mark against him. But sacking Ole was wrong, for me. The facts of his tenure prove it.",
      "We weren’t wrong to sack Jose, who had made the club a very unpleasant place. I think we were wrong to sack Van Gaal. Yes, the football made your eyes bleed but he was in the middle of changing the team, and had form for delivering good football. He still brought success.",
      "Similarly, we were wrong to sack Ten Hag, who was also in the middle of the rebuild, and delivered success on the pitch. We replaced “he has no style” with *this*, after all, and mostly because he never got the media onside. But we should have also listen to Rangnick (also more points per game than Amorim).",
      "It is clear to anyone with eyes that Amorim is not providing any answers and is making more problems than solutions. He needs to go. Whoever comes next needs to be someone who picks the team up again. We aren’t in a position of expecting success – although inevitably there are many “fans” who think otherwise – but we absolutely have a squad that should be at the upper end of the league. That’s not entitlement, that’s just plain obvious. We were, after all, 4 points from 3rd and FA Cup holders when this maniac was appointed against the judgement of Dan Ashworth. The arrogance and ignorance of billionaires in full effect.",
      "The answer is someone stable, who brings some happiness back to the squad. I don’t want it to be Southgate – he was a little weasel of a player – but managers like him are two a penny. And maybe someone like Ruud or Carrick would have a higher ceiling? Give them until the end of the season and then extend for another year, year on year.",

I’m not going to be like that. I am going to be who I am. At that moment I was very disappointed. We had a good pre-season. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham.

So I understand that. And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them.

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",

      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United beat Burnley 3-2 in a game Ruben Amorim defined as \"must win\" following their cup exit at Grimsby; United led twice but were pegged back by Scott Parker's team; Bruno Fernandes netted a stoppage-time winner from penalty spot",
      "Sunday 31 August 2025 12:30, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim said he loves his players when \"they put effort in\" following Manchester United's dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley in a \"must-win\" game.",
      "Twice United led, twice they were pegged back by Burnley on Saturday, but Fernandes stepped up in stoppage time after VAR spotted a shirt pull on Amad Diallo and dispatched the penalty kick. United did create 3.54 worth of expected goals from 26 shots as they did put Burnley under significant pressure.",
      "In midweek, Amorim fuelled speculation over his future saying \"something had to change\" after their embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, before later adding he \"sometimes wants to quit - and sometimes wants to stay at Man Utd for the next 20 years\".",
      "Speaking after their win over Burnley, he said: \"When they [his players] put the effort, I will always love them.",
      "\"Even when Amad is missing that goal - I love Amad, if he's giving everything.",
      "\"We need to understand that we always need to be at this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel the players struggle a little bit, even in the second half but the effort was always there.",
      "\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Amorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.",
      "Cunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.",
      "Asked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"",
      "United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.",
      "Andre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.",
      "Amorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"",
      "\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.",
      "\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.",
      "\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.",
      "\"But the effort was there.",
      "\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.",
      "\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.",
      "\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.",
      "\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"",
      "Amorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.",
      "Sesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.",
      "\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.",
      "\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.",
      "\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.",
      "\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",

      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
