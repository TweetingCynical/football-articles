      "Manchester United have taken the shock decision to SACK Ruben Amorim after his extraordinary rant following the draw at Leeds. Amorim sent a blunt message to the United board in his post-match press conference and has been dismissed the following day.",
      "United have taken immediate action after the 1-1 draw at Elland Road, sacking Amorim after 14 months in charge. Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who is currently the under-18s coach, will take charge of the team for their Premier League game against Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "The decision has been made by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. The Athletic reports that United could leave Fletcher in charge as interim manager until the end of the season, before appointing a full-time replacement.",
      "A statement from United read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Asked if he had confidence from the United board on Sunday, Amorim went on a remarkable rant. \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "Amorim was appointed to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager in November 2024. He oversaw a miserable debut campaign with United finishing a lowly 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "The club currently sits sixth in the Premier League following back-to-back 1-1 draws against Wolves and Leeds. Amorim leaves having won just 24 of his 63 matches in charge after arriving from Sporting Lisbon 14 months ago.",
      "Tensions have boiled over his recent weeks due to frustration from Amorim over his involvement in the club's transfer policy. The United boss has previously hinted at a disagreement with the club hierarchy over plans for the January transfer window.",
      "\"I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time,\" he said on Christmas Eve. \"I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim has been hampered by a raft of injuries, including to club captain Bruno Fernandes, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. United have won just three of their last 11 league games, with the Premier League their only focus after they failed to qualify for Europe and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup in humiliating fashion by Grimsby at the start of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Cameroon's next challenge will be against the hosts, Morocco, on January 9. This means either Mbeumo or fellow United player Noussair Mazraoui will be eliminated by the other and make their way back to Manchester.",
      "Consequently, one of Mbeumo or Mazraoui could potentially be available for the FA Cup clash against Brighton and Hove Albion on 11 January, though the Manchester derby against Manchester City on January 17 seems more realistic. Mbeumo has found form elusive at this winter's Afcon.",
      "Despite providing an assist against Gabon during the group stages, the 26-year-old hasn't contributed to any goals since. Prior to a group stage match against Mozambique, Cameroon boss David Pagou suggested Mbeumo might be placing excessive pressure on himself to perform.",
      "\"He's putting too much pressure on himself, but I think he will manage that,\" Pagou said. \"He's a great footballer, a great player, even for this country.",
      "\"He loves this team and really wants to commit to being ‌as effective as possible. So today, again, in our little chat with him, the desire is there to be present, to ⁠step up, and to do great things.\"",
      "He added: \"Bryan is a player who loves freedom; he has those qualities. So we are not going to deprive him of that and stop him from expressing himself on the pitch the way he wants.",
      "\"It's intentional we let him express himself across the whole field. It's true he's ⁠had some difficulties flourishing.\"",
      "The departure of Mbeumo, Mazraoui and Amad for Afcon has come at a challenging time for United both on and off the pitch. Ruben Amorim's squad has been ravaged by injuries to crucial players, with the team managing just one victory in their last five matches.",
      "United's head coach Amorim has also raised questions about his long-term future at the club, suggesting he may depart when his contract runs out in 18 months. The ex-Sporting manager insisted he should be recognised as the manager at Old Trafford, not merely head coach, despite that being his official designation since Ineos appointed him in November 2024.",

      "Matheus Cunha has told Joshua Zirkzee that he needs to forget about leaving Manchester United and knuckle down to help the team. Zirkzee has been strongly linked with a move to Roma in the January transfer window but has made two telling contributions for United in recent weeks.",
      "The 24-year-old forward has struggled since joining United for £36.5million from Bologna in 2024. He has failed to hold down a place in Ruben Amorim's starting line-up and has agreed to join Roma in January, according to reports in Italy.",
      "However, he started and scored in the 1-1 draw against Wolves last week and came off the bench to set up Cunha's equaliser in the draw at Leeds on Sunday. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Zirkzee has become more important for United, throwing his potential exit into doubt.",
      "The Dutchman has reportedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by manager Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system. But Cunha has pleaded with his team-mate to stay put, swallow his pride and help United during this difficult spell.",
      "\"Josh is a pleasure,\" he told Match of the Day. \"I feel like he has a lot of quality. Of course, his situation is not easy, but he has everything to change the situation. We need him. He needs to understand this and then everyone can count on him.",
      "\"But yeah, we are here to push him. And I think after the goal last week and the assist today, I think it will give him confidence to be more with us and then understand more his role in the team.\"",
      "Amorim's view of Zirkzee was evident in the starting line-up he named at Elland Road on Sunday, with the forward left on the bench alongside a whole host of academy players. However, Zirkzee made a huge difference when he came off the bench for Leny Yoro in the second half and produced a moment of quality to play in Cunha for the equaliser.",
      "His performance earned praise from his manager post-match. \"It's really important,\" Amorim said. \"I think Ben [Sesko] improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active.",
      "\"He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "Zirkzee has started just four Premier League games this season following the £200m arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo in the summer transfer window. He has contributed just nine goals and four assists in 63 appearances for United altogether and under different circumstances may have been shown the exit this month.",

      "Omar Berrada is expected to side with Manchester United's director of football Jason Wilcox if it comes down to a straight fight with him and Ruben Amorim amid their apparent power struggle",
      "Amorim let fire in another press conference following his side's 1-1 draw at Leeds, where he claimed he had been appointed as a manager, not a head coach. His gripes appear to centre around the club's transfer activity going forward.",
      "The Portuguese's issues with Wilcox are casting doubt over his future, but a battle with one of the club's most influential figures would likely end badly for the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, especially if the CEO was forced to have a say.",
      "talkSPORT reports that one of Amorim's frustrations stem from Wilcox urging him to show some pragmatism tactically. Previously he had stuck defiantly to his 3-4-3 formation, despite its lack of success. In more recent weeks he did go to a back four, but reverted back to type at the weekend.",
      "Wilcox would appear to have the backing of Berrada, who is part of a structure put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, trusted to run the club on his behalf.",
      "Amorim feels as though promises regarding this transfer window have been broken with United now planning a quiet January, whilst he had been hoping to further bolster his squad. United did spend over £200million in the summer on their frontline, but holes still exist in their squad.",
      "One of Amorim's frustrations was with the decision to pursue Benjamin Sesko, who cost the club £70m, but has struggled to have an impact as of yet. United's head coach would've preferred to sign Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa given he has proven himself in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim has also made it clear that he expects to move on when his contract concludes at the end of next season. He said: \"In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director – [they] need to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has accused Ruben Amorim of over-stating his importance at Manchester United after his extraordinary rant following the draw at Leeds. Amorim dropped a bombshell in the post-match press conference by throwing his weight around amid tensions behind the scenes at Old Trafford.",
      "The United boss has previously hinted at a disagreement with the club hierarchy over plans for the January transfer window. \"I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time,\" he said on Christmas Eve. \"I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim refused to be drawn on the meaning behind those comments in the run-up to United's 1-1 draw against Leeds. But his true feelings came pouring out after the game in remarkable fashion when Amorim was asked about having confidence from the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United,\" he ranted. \"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change.

      "Former United striker Rooney was shocked by Amorim's comments and warned the Portuguese that he is over-playing his hand.",
      "Asked what he made of Amorim's comments, Rooney said on the Wayne Rooney Show: \"It's strange, interesting. I think his choice of words are decisive, confusing. I think he speaks with a confidence and an authority that he knows he's going to be there as manager (for the next 18 months) and he's going to remain the manager.",
      "\"And that's the only reason I can assume that he speaks with that belief because the last two games haven't been very good. It's quite confusing.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't think he'll have 18 more months if it carries on, I think that's fair to say. I think you need to earn the right to be able to dictate exactly what happens at a football club, especially a football club like Manchester United.",
      "\"If [Pep] Guardiola comes into United for instance, I don't think anyone would question what players he wants to bring in, or the system. I feel for him (Amorim) a little bit because the squad is not good enough, the players he's got on the bench are young academy kids - it's great to see them on the bench, but are they ready at this moment in time? It's very difficult to put young players onto a football pitch when the team is not very good, so I feel for him a little bit.",
      "\"But he's not Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp - he hasn't got that history or that background, so I don't think he should be speaking with that authority in what he is and I just think the words he's saying are very confusing to me.\"",

      "Manchester United could be disappointed in their search for a Ruben Amorim successor if they go after Zinedine Zidane. That's after the World Cup-winner already gave a damning answer concerning a potential contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim, 40, has been sacked as United boss after disappointing 1-1 draw away to Leeds on Sunday. In the aftermath, he suggested he'll leave when his contract expires in 18 months, insisting he came to United \"to be the manager, not the coach,\" and took aim at certain board members to focus on their jobs. However, his departure has come much earlier, with the decision made on Monday morning.",
      "United haven't budged from sixth in the Premier League, but there are only four points between them and Crystal Palace in 14th. The campaign is reminiscent of the 2021/22 campaign that saw them finish sixth before Erik ten Hag took over that summer.",
      "It was around the same time Zidane, who has been a free agent since leaving Real Madrid in 2021, gave a direct hint at his prospects of taking over in Manchester. And despite being highly desirable candidate for the position, he nodded to one key impasse that could stop any chance of the switch.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe at the time, he gave a nine-word response when addressing United rumours specifically, which may suggest he'll never work in the Premier League: \"I understand English, but I don't fully master it.\"",
      "He continued: \"I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play in order to win, it is a global context. I know what I need to win.\"",
      "From that, one might assume Zidane wouldn't be comfortable taking a job in England unless he was fluent in the language. The Frenchman spent the last five years of his playing career at Real before joining the club's advisory board and then climbing the coaching ranks.",
      "It resulted in one of the most prolific managerial spells in history, claiming three Champions League titles, two league wins and two FIFA Club World Cups in only four-and-a-half seasons. United could only dream of such success in their current mould, though their issues run far deeper than coaching selection alone.",
      "Zidane's former France team-mate and fellow 1998 World Cup-winner Emmanuel Petit has since revealed his old colleague has spent time learning English. Speaking to DAZN Bet in 2023, Petit suggested this means Zidane has \"changed his mind about managing a team in England,\" though there's nothing concrete to suggest as much.",
      "There's also the major barrier of a certain vacancy soon to open up at the France helm. Didier Deschamps' highly successful run as boss of Les Bleus will end after the 2026 World Cup, and it's widely believed Zidane is being lined up as his heir.",
      "One can understand why taking control of his national side is a far more attractive prospect than attempting to resuscitate United. However, it may work in Amorim's favour if arguably the best free-agent coaching option on the market doesn't want his job.",
      "From a United perspective, the club needs captain Fernandes back as soon as possible, which Amorim has hinted could be this month. The next obstacle is a trip to Turf Moor to face Burnley on Wednesday, where anything but three points would only encourage speculation Amorim is bound for the exit.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has hammered Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, saying the Portuguese head coach is a 'barely competent' top-flight manager. The comments come after the United boss dropped an explosive post-match press conference following the draw with Leeds United, hitting out at United's sporting director, Jason Wilcox, and former defender Gary Neville.",
      "Amorim said he wanted to be the manager of the team, not a head coach, wanting control of every department, including scouting. He then namedropped Gary Neville and called on Wilcox to do his job, while Amorim did his own.",
      "\"It started to look like maybe he was getting somewhere moving to a back four, he went back to five at the back against Wolves and it brought possibly one of the worst performances of the season from a team. No matter what it is, I don't think he is in any position whatsoever to be questioning the people who appointed him.",
      "\"He's not good enough. He's not good enough to be Manchester United's manager. He's barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now. That's not me being disrespectful to Amorim.",
      "\"He's been there well over 12 months now and I think almost all managers in the Premier League who are managing different clubs at different ends of the table would look at Manchester United and think 'I'd get more points than that.' This is a guy who said at one stage this is possibly the worst Manchester United team in history. He's managing it.\"",
      "Responding to the idea that Amorim had not been backed, Carragher said: \"He's been more than backed. He couldn't have had too many complaints if the club parted company with him in the summer, with how poor it was last season.",
      "\"They then went into the market and spent a lot of money. I'm sure he was heavily involved in that. He's playing a system that is not in the traditions of Man United, so there was no way they could go out and recruit all the attacking players, and the wing backs and perhaps the centre backs.",
      "\"It was going to be a long term plan in terms of windows. He can't be complaining now about the funds in January. Manchester United spent a huge amount in the summer. Don't forget, they had no Champions League football, no European football and a lot of that was down to him.",
      "\"Let's not forget, when he was brought in, the idea was to get them back to Champions League football. They were four points off the Champions League when he came in. They finished 15th. So when you talk about the lack of funds, that was down to him and the team, and there's no way he's going to get everything he wants in one window.\"",
      "He continued: \"Of course they need need better players but it can't come in one window. He - or the club - decided to go with attacking players, they could have maybe gone with one midfielder, one attacking player, one wing-back but they didn't and maybe they'll come in future windows.",
      "\"But the people he seems to be having a go at - (chief executive) Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox - they're the ones who brought him in and were probably the ones who were fighting in the summer to keep him in a job. I'm sure Jim Ratcliffe is looking at the situation and thinking you've brought in a guy, he doesn't play the way Manchester United have in the past and the results are horrendous.\"",
      "Carragher compared Amorim's comments to Enzo Maresca's recent outburst at Chelsea and subsequent departure from Stamford Bridge. He said: \"This could be over very quickly. But Maresca was in a much stronger position to challenge his board and the owner than Amorim.",
      "\"He won the Club World Cup. He got the team into the Champions League. He did everything he was asked to do last season. I still didn't think it was acceptable to challenge the people above him.",
      "\"Amorim is in no position whatsoever to speak like that. As I said, he's a barely competent Premier League manager so far on what he has shown.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The January transfer window is open and we've already seen a major move, with Brennan Johnson joining Crystal Palace for £35million.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is expected to be the next big deal, with his £65m move from Bournemouth to Manchester City still in the pipeline. Liverpool have agreed a deal with Austria Vienna centre-back Ifeanyi Ndukwe, with a deal for Marc Guehi not looking likely this month.",
      "There is tension at Manchester United over transfers after Ruben Amorim's extraordinary rant after their 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday. They have been busy moving loanees around, but not signing new players, much to Amorim's frustration.",
      "Meanwhile, the race for Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is heating up, with Real Madrid joining the Premier League's heavyweights in courting the England star.",
      "A statement from United reads: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim has been dismissed as Manchester United manager following his remarkable rant at Leeds.",
      "Full developing story here.",
      "One of the hot tickets emerging in the transfer market over the past six months if Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz. However, just as quickly as rumours appeared to suggest a move to Arsenal could be on the cards, it seems the prospect has now been snuffed out.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has in recent weeks linked the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Bayern Munich with a move for the player. However, it's now been suggested that the Turkey international was only dangled in front of those teams to encourage movement from the Bianconeri.",
      "That's according to Sport Witness, which has corroborated reports that Yildiz is seemingly now set to sign new terms in Turin. And the 20-year-old will supposedly join Jonathan David as the club's joint-highest earner on a deal that could run until 2031.",
      "Former Wolves manager Gary O'Neil is in talks to become Liam Rosenior's replacement at Strasbourg, according to The Athletic.",
      "Rosenior is poised to leave the French side for sister club Chelsea, who are replacing Enzo Maresca.",
      "O'Neil has been linked with several clubs since leaving Wolves over a year ago, including Southampton and Middlesbrough, but remains available.",
      "The 42-year-old is one of the finalists to join Strasbourg and Chelsea will reportedly not announce Rosenior's arrival until their sister club has finalised an appointment.",
      "Ruben Amorim decided to unload in the post-match press conference yesterday.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United,\" he ranted. \"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.\"",
      "Those comments have not gone unnoticed among the United hierarchy and have only heightened tensions behind the scenes, which are largely centred around control of transfers.",
      "United are expected to be very quiet in the January window, despite the thin squad due to injuries and AFCON.",
      "Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Ifeanyi Ndukwe from Austria Vienna.",
      "The 17-year-old defender will cost around £2.6million but cannot join this month because he doesn't turn 18 until March. He is expected to go into the under-21s squad when he does arrive but will bolster the centre-back stocks which have been running short at Anfield.",
      "The 6ft 5in defender was scouted by Liverpool's new director of global talent Matt Newberry.",
      "Tottenham have had an £8million bid rejected by Santos for left-back Souza, according to The Athletic.",
      "The 19-year-old has a €100m (£87.1m) release clause in his contract with the Brazilian side and Santos are therefore hesitant to accept lower bids.",
      "Liam Rosenior flew into London from Strasbourg yesterday and could be officially appointed as Chelsea's new manager today.",
      "The 41-year-old former Hull City manager flew in with Strasbourg president Marc Keller and sporting director David Weir on Sunday and will succeed Enzo Maresca.",
      "Negotiations should be straightforward, given Strasbourg are owned by BlueCo and are Chelsea's sister club.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Amass is a wanted man. The 18-year-old has been enjoying himself on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, but his deal there is about to run out.",
      "Wednesday want to keep him, and Amass would be happy to stay, but United could decide to send him elsewhere, given the Owls' predicament at the bottom of the Championship.",
      "Watford have emerged as another suitor after Chelsea recalled the injured Caleb Wiley, leaving them short at left-back.",
      "Adam Wharton has been strongly linked with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City - and now Real Madrid have reportedly entered the race for the Crystal Palace midfielder.",
      "Spanish newspaper AS notes that Wharton has been offered to Real, who are not currently considering a move in the January transfer window, but could enter the race in the summer.",
      "Stay tuned and we'll get you up to speed with all the latest from the Premier League and beyond."

      "Gary Neville has waded in on Ruben Amorim's \"bizarre\" post-match press conference comments after the Manchester United boss seemed to hint that the club and he would go their own ways when his contract expires.",
      "The United boss cast doubt over his future at Old Trafford following the 1-1 draw at Leeds United on Sunday. Amorim had hinted at issues behind the scenes in his press conference on Friday before escalating the issue at Elland Road.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear. I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Amorim also repeated that everyone would move on when his contract expires in 18 months. He also suggested that he had been promised more power to reshape the club, while also name-checking Neville in the process.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach,\" he said. \"And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal.",
      "\"That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Neville and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club. No, guys, I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. And every department, the scouting department, the sports director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"",
      "Following Amorim's rant, Neville was asked about his thoughts on the matter on the Gary Neville podcast from the Etihad Stadium. \"Some bizarre comments around, 'I'm a manager, not a head coach'. I just said about Maresca, once you start this game-playing in your press conferences, something is obviously annoying him, he's not feeling the support and he's letting go,\" he said.",
      "\"To say that you've come to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed head coach of the football club and appointed to coach the team. Manager is a title that we don't see anymore. I don't know what Pep Guardiola is at Manchester City.",
      "\"Manager suggests that he's saying that he wants to manage more than just the training ground performance. He wants to overlook other parts of the club. They have a greater say on other parts of the club, like recruitment, academy, style of play and how the club go about their pre-season friendlies.",
      "\"He's suggesting, maybe, that he needs to be given the ability to manage more departments of the club. I've not seen the press conference at all, they've just been sent to me by the staff producer, but [he said] about other people doing their job in their department.",
      "\"Again, that would suggest that he's not happy with something. Something's happened there in the last week with the quotes that are coming out, that mean that Ruben Amorim is now starting to unleash and as Maresca did.",
      "\"It's not quite that, but it's something similar in a way that it's not explicit what it means, but everyone's having to read inbetween the lines. It looks to me that he's not happy about something in the hierarchy.",
      "\"He's mentioned my name in it as well, apparently. That's the sort of thing that managers tend to do towards difficult periods, they have a go at pundits. No problem with that whatsoever. I've actually been quite supported of Manchester United's performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "\"I thought they were very good. I couldn't be supportive the other night against Wolves, if that's what he's referring to. It wasn't right the other night and you have to say that. It wasn't right against 10-men Everton.",
      "\"I am going to call out when I see things that aren't right because that's my job. That aside, the bigger problem isn't about what he said about me, matter of fact, it's not a problem at all, it's more the problem of what he's saying is happening behind the scenes.\"",

      "\"We controlled more the possession, the connection, the position of the players. I think they were in the better positions to play, and that can show in the way we played. We had more chances than the opponent to score, but we need to not to think about the next one.\"",
      "\"It's really important. I think Ben improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active. He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing he's always there, and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side. He's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong. I don't agree. I think the right position. He just need to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",
      "\"Josh needs to be prepared to play in every game. All the players need to be ready. If you play 20 minutes, you need to play 20 minutes to help the team. He does that. He's a player from our team. That's it.\"",

      "Deprived of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, Amorim showed he was willing to adapt. And yet, when they went to Elland Road on Sunday, Amorim went with the tried, tested and turgid.",
      "In a dour first half, it was safety first for the away side against their rivals. Only when Zirkzee was introduced in the 63rd minute for Yoro did the tide turn for United as the Dutchman produced a lovely through ball for Matheus Cunha to tuck into the net and earn a point in a 1-1 draw.",
      "United's indifferent recent form owes much to an injury crisis coinciding with the Africa Cup of Nations. Amorim is working with a thin squad and has therefore opted for pragmatism over everything else. But it seems that his understanding that adaptation is needed has only come after he was told that funds will not be made available in the January transfer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has hinted that Bruno Fernandes could return for Manchester United before the end of January. United have been without their captain for the past three games due to injury, but he could return to the side in the coming weeks.",
      "Fernandes was substituted at half-time in United's 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa on December 21. The Portuguese playmaker has been a huge miss for Amorim, whose side have beaten Newcastle 1-0 and drawn 1-1 with Wolves and Leeds in his absence.",
      "The injury has also coincided with other absences. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are all available due to injuries.",
      "United had a thread-bare substitutes' bench at Elland Road on Sunday, with Joshua Zirkzee, Altay Bayindir and Tyrell Malacia the only three senior players amongst a group of academy players. Matheus Cunha earned United a point with a finish from Zirkzee's through ball after Brenden Aaronson put Leeds ahead.",
      "Asked if Fernandes and Mount might return for the next game, Amorim said: \"We'll see.\"",
      "Amorim has already stated that United won't be busy in January, having spent over £200million in the summer. \"United is one of the best clubs in the world. If you are here and focusing on a different club then something is wrong with you,\" he added.",
      "The first half was a drab occasion at Elland Road before Aaronson took advantage of some slack defending to put Leeds 1-0 up. Cunha brought United level and later hit the post, but Amorim was largely happy with what he saw.",
      "\"I think we played well,\" he said. \"I think we had more control in this game than we showed against Wolves. That is important because it shows how you can prepare for this week with the mistakes that we learned from the last game. We controlled Leeds, on the set pieces, the second balls, they are really quick up front. We controlled it well.",
      "\"We had our opportunities to win the game. We are losing games on the details - the Leeds goal, we are controlling the game and then one kick of the ball in transition but we managed to get back into the game. Last year it would be completely different. This year we are more in control of the games than we were last year but we are frustrated not to win.\"",

      "This was supposed to be a 'War of the Roses'. But it resembled more of a pillow fight between two rivals who wilted in the winter sunshine. And even two goals in three second half minutes couldn't add much gloss to what turned into one of the biggest anti-climaxes of the season.",
      "It ended honours even, with Matheus Cunha salvaging a point for Manchester United, after Brenden Aaronson had put the home side ahead. And the outcome will have left a bitter taste in the mouths of respective managers Daniel Farke and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Farke knows Leeds will have rarely had a better chance to beat bitter rivals they haven't got the better of in the league since 2002. While the point will do nothing to ease the pressure on Amorim, whose side has now failed to overcome rock-bottom Wolves, and a newly-promoted side, in their last two outings.",
      "Farke had insisted this was 'more than a game', due to the long history of vitriol and hatred which existed between these trans Pennine clubs. But animosities of the past failed to make the present, on an afternoon that will live short in the memories.",
      "Amorim was getting his first taste of one of the most explosive fixtures in football. And he appeared to have arrived at Elland Road on a mission to circle the wagons.",
      "Of the 10 outfield players he named in his side, eight of them were defence minded. While lone striker Benjamin Sesko had scored just twice in 15 league games this season.",
      "Leeds might have been without influential captain Ethan Ampadu, who was suspended, while the hosts had had 48 hours less to prepare for this clash than United had. But Farke must have taken one look at the United team sheet and thought the visitors were there for the taking.",
      "Not least because his Leeds team were bursting with confidence, having thumped Chelsea here as part of a six game unbeaten run. This was just the fifth time in 22 years Leeds had hosted United - and home supporters were determined to make the most of it. It was just a shame Farke's players didn't seem to have the same enthusiasm.",
      "The hosts were lacklustre, meaning United didn't have much of a storm to weather, to be honest. Sesko had a shot blocked and Manuel Ugarte headed just wide, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin screwed a shot off target.",
      "Calvert-Lewin also saw a glancing header come back of the right hand post, while Lucas Perri produced a superb, instinctive save to tip over Leny Yorro's header from point blank range. But the first half was memorable for how forgettable it was.",
      "And then a game broke out. Kind of. Aaronson put Leeds ahead, catching Ayden Heaven cold to beat him to a hopeful ball forward and finish past Senne Lammens.",
      "But the lead lasted three minutes before Elland Road was sent into silence. Cunha latched onto a pass from substitute Joshua Zirkzee, before beating the stranded Perri with a slide-rule finish to make it 1-1.",
      "Lammens did well to keep out Noah Okafor's overhead kick, while Sesko missed a sitter at the opposite end. Cunha also hit the post with 10 minutes remaining. But in truth, this game didn't deserve to have a winner.",

      "Napoli's clash with Lazio in Serie A ended with three men sent-off after a mass brawl between the two teams.",
      "The reigning Italian top-flight champions, Napoli, met Lazio on Sunday afternoon at Stadio Olimpico and claimed a 2-0 win in the fixture.",
      "Former Manchester United star Scott McTominay starred for Napoli, once again. However, this time he did not get on the score-sheet to add to his tally of five goals so far this season.",
      "Leonardo Spinazzola and Amir Rrahmani scored the goals for Napoli to secure the three points for Antonio Conte's side. There was also high drama in the closing minutes of the contest.",
      "Indeed, there was a brawl between players from both clubs, which began after a flashpoint between Lazio defender Adam Marusic and Napoli full-back Pasquale Mazzocchi, who made an appearance from the bench.",
      "Marusic and Mazzocchi both began pushing each other while Lazio were in possession, with the game eventually stopped by referee Davide Massa, who had to intervene after a brawl began between players and staff from both teams. When the situation calmed down, Massa went on to hand out red cards to both Marusic and Mazzocchi.",
      "Earlier in the game, meanwhile, Lazio star Tijjani Noslin was also shown a red card after picking up two bookings. The latter of which came in the 81st minute.",
      "As a result, Lazio not only went on to lose the game 2-0, but also finished up with just nine players after having Marusic and Noslin sent off. United loanee Rasmus Hojlund started the match for Napoli - but was subbed in the 86th minute to be replaced by Noa Lang.",
      "The win for Napoli leaves McTominay, Hojlund and Co. in second place in the Serie A table and one point behind leaders AC Milan. They have won the Scudetto twice in three years.",
      "Napoli's next match will see them host Verona in Serie A on Thursday evening.",
      "Lazio are, meanwhile, ninth in the table and will face Fiorentina on Wednesday night.",
      "Recent weeks have seen speculation swirl that United could have an interest in re-signing McTominay after his impressive season with Napoli. Hojlund, meanwhile, is spending the season on loan with the Serie A giants, and there are suggestions that he could move to Italy on a permanent deal next summer.",

      "Leeds United and Manchester United played out a draw at Elland Road after the hosts failed to capitalise on their opponents' slow start. Brenden Aaronson got the wrong side of Ayden Heaven to fire Leeds in front, only for Matheus Cunha to deliver an instant equaliser.",
      "The home side had chances to restore their lead, with Senne Lammens producing a fine save to keep out Noah Okafor's acrobatic effort and substitute Joel Piroe almost hitting a winner moments after coming off the bench. In between those chances, Cunha came close to snatching victory for the visitors, only for his effort to clip the outside of the post.",
      "United had the ball in the net early on in a quiet first half, but Cunha's celebrations were cut short by an offside flag. Leeds had been victims of a flag themselves in their midweek game against Liverpool, and the man involved that time, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, had an early sniff of goal on his return to the starting XI.",
      "Neither team showed much quality before the break, and the opening exchanges were summed up when Diogo Dalot swung at an inviting ball and sent it flying over the crossbar. At the other end, Leeds had two penalty appeals brushed off in short order, one for handball and another when James Justin went down under pressure from Lisandro Martinez.",
      "It was almost 1-0 to the hosts moments after that, though. Calvert-Lewin rose highest to meet an inviting cross from the right and headed against the foot of the post with Senne Lammens beaten.",
      "It wasn't until the hour mark that the game truly came to life. Aaronson capitalised on Heaven's uncertainty at the back before confidently beating Lammens, only for United sub Joshua Zirkzee to create an instant response from Cunha.",
      "Given the scale of United's absentee list, Joshua Zirkzee's failure to earn a start was hardly a vote of confidence. If he can't get one now then one imagines he will be well down the pecking order once the likes of Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo are back in contention.",
      "Whatever United wanted from the Dutchman, it hasn't arrived with nearly enough consistency and that debut goal against Fulham feels a lifetime away. He can still offer something in an attacking sense, though, and made an immediate impact from the bench with his assist for Cunha's equaliser after a disgusted Ruben Amorim responded to going a goal behind by instantly introducing an extra attacker.",
      "There were reports in Italy earlier in the week suggesting a loan move to Roma remains possible, perhaps followed by a summer swap deal involving centre-back Evan Ndicka. After this cameo, though, he may have convinced Amorim he deserves another chance.",
      "There's been growing noise around an England recall for Dominic Calvert-Lewin following his form for Leeds. He went into Sunday's game with eight league goals to his name this term - more than he managed in any of his last four Everton seasons - at a rate of one every 142 minutes.",
      "You have to go back to the 2020/21 season for the last time he reached double figures in the Premier League. That's also the last time he was called up by England, with his most recent cap coming in the Euro 2020 quarter-final victory over Ukraine, but a first-half header against the post was another reminder he's a player with both form and confidence.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has decisions to make when preparing his England squad ahead of the summer World Cup. If Calvert-Lewin is still playing like this going into the March international break, you wouldn't be surprised to see the boss take a closer look.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been cagey when discussing Manchester United's transfer plans, hinting that it could be a quiet January. However, the threadbare nature of the bench may well remain a concern.",
      "Six of the eight United outfielders on the bench are academy youngsters, five of them teenagers, and Amorim opted not to introduce any of them on Sunday. As well as those youngsters, 19-year-old Heaven started once more at centre-back and sadly showed his inexperience to allow Leeds to break the deadlock.",
      "Heaven joined in what was a relatively restrained winter window last year but has quickly shown his worth, despite the unwelcome moment at Elland Road. The second half of the current campaign may be about Amorim improving the players he has rather than finding a quick fix.",
      "Before kick-off, you had to go back more than 20 years for the last time Leeds beat Manchester United at Elland Road. They might have been out of the top flight for a considerable period in between but that's still six league or cup encounters with five away wins and a solitary goalless draw in 2021.",
      "This felt like as good a chance as any to end that unwanted run, and they looked destined to win when Aaronson fired them in front. Had they been able to avoid an instant reply, there may well have been no way back for the visitors.",
      "Instead, though, they had to settle for a point. It's still a valuable one after weekend defeats for fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest and West Ham but it could have been more.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had support from Joshua Zirkzee in United's last game against Wolves, with the latter scoring at Old Trafford. Zirkzee dropped to the bench on Sunday, and the focus on his fellow forward didn't seem to benefit summer arrival Sesko.",
      "Despite the Slovenia star's relative youth, he's a player with plenty of top level experience. However, his first 15 Premier League outings - including nine starts - brought just two goals before kick-off at Elland Road.",
      "Some fans have pointed to a lack of service, but that hasn't been the only problem. A wayward header from Casemiro's 54th minute cross pointed to a lack of precision from the leading man, even if an offside flag made it moot, and a worse miss followed 17 minutes from time after Zirkzee's cutback.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Amorim is without Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt through injury, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim opted to start against Leeds with six defenders and two holding midfielders. Patrick Dorgu has been pushed up the field to play as one of the No.10s in United's 3-4-2-1 formation, with Luke Shaw at left wing-back and Benjamin Sesko leading the line.",
      "Zirkzee's omission is hardly a ringing endorsement of the Dutch forward, who is one of three senior players a heavily depleted bench alongside back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and defender Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Zirkzee scored with a deflected effort against Wolves to net his second goal in 13 appearances across all competitions. He has struggled since joining from Bologna for £36.5million in 2024 and has been heavily linked with a move in the January transfer window.",
      "The 24-year-old has agreed to join Roma, according to reports in Italy. He has reportedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by manager Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether United would sanction the move, given their current injury and AFCON crisis. Amorim has been clear that United will not be busy in January and has vetoed an exit for Mainoo to Napoli.",

      "“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”",

Amorim's strained relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox has been brought into the open by the 40-year-old in recent weeks and his outburst on Sunday has proved to be the final straw.",
      "The Portuguese was informed on Monday morning that he was being sacked and he leaves the club with immediate affect. He departs with a record of just 24 wins in 63 games. The decision to dispense with the services of Amorim was taken by United's leadership team, including Wilcox and chief excecutive Omar Berrada.",
      "It had been on the cards since the former Sporting boss used the final question of his post-match press conference on Sunday to fire a stunnig broadside at the club, accusing them of a smear campaign against him and demanding more power. \"Guys, to stop with that, I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said.",

      "Dan Ashworth would have known the end was coming at Manchester United when he was marched through the press conference room soon after the defeat to Nottingham Forest in December 2024. This was a public sacking for a figure who had gone from hero to zero in five months in the eyes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ashworth was the man Ratcliffe called \"one of the best sporting directors in the world\" during protracted negotiations with Newcastle to lure him to Old Trafford. However, within months, relations had soured. It reflected poorly on Ratcliffe at the time and arguably even worse now.",
      "Ratcliffe could have picked up the phone to anyone in the game and been told Ashworth was a structures guy, not the kind of sporting director who would hand over a list of the five most highly rated 30-something coaches in Europe. He was a sensible appointment for a club that needed reshaping.",
      "But his caution over the appointment of Ruben Amorim ultimately did for him. Ashworth could see the problems coming of parachuting in a head coach mid-season who had a distinctive playing style. This wasn't a squad built for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and neither did United have the cash to transform it.",
      "It was a sensible, pragmatic, common-sense approach, but didn't fit with the bravado and excitement of everyone else involved. Amorim was the shiny new toy, the up-and-coming coach who had built an excellent reputation at Sporting and when he guided his old club to a 4-1 win against Manchester City in November 2024, Old Trafford had fallen head over heels.",
      "In hindsight, the concerns Ashworth highlighted were correct. Amorim might still be an excellent coach (or manager), and with the right players, his system might be a success. But these weren't conditions he was ever likely to encounter at United.",
      "Instead, he has played his system without the tools to do and his team has become too predictable as a result. Most of the best managers in the game have a fairly distinctive style of play, but it is often unstoppable because they have the players to execute it. Not at Old Trafford for Amorim.",
      "Maybe he will survive this power struggle and eventually create a successful team, but when his bosses are telling him to change the system and that there is no money, it's hard to see how that will ever happen.",
      "The dilemma for director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada is that their reputations at the club are linked to Amorim. This was their big call and it looks like it is about to all go horribly wrong. It will take some explaining away when there was at least one senior figure in the building sounding the alarm bells.",
      "They ignored that warning and pressed ahead anyway. The surprise is the nature of the unravelling now, less than 14 months on, not that it is happening at all.",
      "If United do pull the plug on Amorim, does Ratcliffe trust Wilcox and Berrada to get the next appointment right? Ratcliffe himself has hitched himself to the success of a head coach he likes.",
      "The 73-year-old was desperate for his first appointment to be the right one, but that doesn't look likely. End it now and the past 13-and-a-half months will feel like a waste. United are no further on than when Erik ten Hag was sacked.",
      "Ashworth might have advocated an appointment considered safer, maybe even a little more boring. He would have been panned for pushing Gareth Southgate's credentials and Thomas Frank has struggled with the step up from Brentford to Tottenham. But in pointing out the pitfalls of going for Amorim, he could see what was likely to happen.",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with Leeds in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon. Leeds headed into the game unbeaten in six league matches, and they drew first blood against their rivals.",
      "Brenden Aaronson opened the scoring in the 62nd minute after sloppy play from United, but Ruben Amorim introduced Joshua Zirkzee and the change immediately paid off.",
      "Zirkzee provided an assist for Cunha, whose goal ensured the points were shared. Here are the moments you might have missed:",
      "Amorim outburst",
      "\"We are losing because of the second balls,\" said Amorim last month, so it wasn't a surprise to see the 40-year-old lash out on the touchline when United failed to win a second ball against Leeds. Benjamin Sesko lost the initial aerial duel for the header, despite his height advantage, and Patrick Dorgu didn't react quickly enough to pounce on the second ball.",
      "Amorim responded by lashing out. He aggressively waved his arms in frustration, which suggested he felt Sesko and Dorgu had to do better in that moment. Dorgu was not in the correct starting position to win the ball because he is not used to playing as a right-side No.10. Amorim was frustrated, but he decided to play the defender out of position.",
      "Sesko had no excuses, however, as he should be winning most headers at 6ft 4in. The Slovenia international didn't offer much off the ball and must improve in that area, especially when he's not scoring.",
      "Hands on their heads",
      "And the reaction from Sesko's teammates when he missed a chance from close range with 15 minutes remaining was telling. Cunha, Luke Shaw and Casemiro had their hands on their heads.",
      "Zirkzee played the ball into the box after a clever pass from Cunha, but the 22-year-old volleyed wide and squandered the type of chance that top Premier League strikers put away.",
      "Premier League games are decided by fine margins. The standard in the top-flight has increased - the table is tighter than ever - and it's crucial to capitalise on chances when they are presented.",
      "United would have returned to Manchester with a 2-1 victory if Sesko had buried it.",
      "Zirkzee's reaction",
      "It was noticeable that the only two senior outfield substitutes, Joshua Zirkzee and Tyrell Malacia, wore their long winter coats during the warm-up, while the remainder of the substitutes (who were all players from the academy) kicked the ball around wearing just their sweatshirts.",
      "It was a freezing cold day in West Yorkshire, the type of weather that would make any senior professional who is hardly playing question their future. As it happens, Zirkzee already wants to leave, and he might have been thinking about a return to Italy while he warmed up with academy players.",
      "Amorim preferred to play Dorgu, a defender, over Zirkzee at Elland Road, just a week after hooking Zirkzee at half-time to give Jack Fletcher his third appearance for the first team.",
      "Zirkzee would have felt demoralised by the team selection, but he channelled his frustration in the right way when he came on from the bench, immediately providing an excellent assist. The pass into the box to Cunha was perfectly-weighted, and Zirkzee's contribution didn't go unnoticed as the Brazilian celebrated because Lisandro Martinez sprinted to embrace him.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox spotted",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was spotted sitting behind Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at Elland Road. Amorim has previously spoken about his warm relationship with the Ineos' decision-makers, but there was a hint of tension when the United boss spoke at his press conference ahead of facing Leeds.",
      "Amorim appeared to be concerned that conversations had not taken place about new signings in the January window, and he was unusually spiky for a pre-match press conference. Berrada and Wilcox oversaw the appointment of Amorim, and it will reflect badly on the pair if he is sacked. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants United to be 'best in class' - but they couldn't even claim a win against Leeds.",
      "'Biggest game of the season'",
      "Leeds-United is a historic rivalry. Of course, United fans are always desperate to beat Leeds, but this is the game of the season for Leeds fans, a point that was was proved by a comment from a Leeds fan sitting next to the press box.",
      "\"But it's our biggest game of the season,\" the fan said when a steward asked him to take his seat instead of standing up. The Elland Road stadium announcer introduced United as the 'red side' before kick-off, and every United player was booed as their names were out. Vitriol poured out from every stand in the ground, with Leeds fans chanting \"scum, scum, scum\" and \"get into them, f*** them up\". That was followed by \"stand up if you hate Man U\".",
      "The raucous atmosphere only lasted for 15 minutes, though. United managed the game intelligently in the first half, and you could have heard a pin drop when half-time arrived.",

      "For five minutes, Ruben Amorim's post-match press conference at Elland Road had been mundane. He had defended Benjamin Sesko and hailed an improved performance. Then, in less than 90 seconds of answers, he pulled the pin on the grenade and started a civil war at Manchester United.",
      "The question now is, where does he go from here? Amorim insisted he wouldn't quit. His comments had a back me or sack me vibe and three wins since October would make the former a surprise. The 40-year-old has begun a power struggle and calling out director of scouting Christopher Vivell and director of football Jason Wilcox made clear where the manager believes the fault lines lie.",
      "There had been talk of a rupture in the corridors of power for a few weeks and now Amorim has laid it all out in the open. He began his explosive comments by telling the media that we \"receive selective information about everything.\"",
      "So what was he talking about? It would be a safe bet to say that he had been riled by a story in the Daily Mail over the weekend that exposed concerns from Vivell and Wilcox about the playing style and Amorim's back three system. His brief flirtation with a back four in December has been shelved but where it came from in the first place is a bit of a mystery.",
      "Amorim had been so steadfast in his refusal to ever move away from a system he had used throughout his managerial career that his volte-face came as a surprise. It is telling that he has abandoned it as quickly as he rolled it out. Wilcox is concerned about United's predictability in Amorim's set-up, and it is clear that opposition teams find it easy to prepare for.",
      "If Amorim was considering meeting Wilcox halfway, then he has clearly changed his mind. Being told there would be no money in January has been the final straw. United were prepared to spend £65million on Antoine Semenyo and despite seeing the 25-year-old opt for Manchester City, they have made it clear he wasn't being signed to play left wing-back.",
      "Having missed out on Semenyo, that cash has now been put back in the safe. Amorim's grumbles on transfer business have been building for a couple of weeks. Before the Wolves game, he was asked about recruitment, and in hindsight, his comments hint at the division that was brewing behind the scenes.",
      "\"I have one idea, Jason and the board have another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" he said. \"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything.",
      "\"But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player would not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "With everything that has happened since, that line about the manager understanding the way of playing looks like the first of many messages delivered to his bosses in the last week or so.",
      "He raised the stakes on Friday with his refusal to answer why he had come to the conclusion that he wouldn't get the time or money to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\"; however, his response to his questioner, \"You are a smart guy,\" was a clear hint that the conclusion was obvious.",
      "And for those left in any doubt, Amorim shredded it all on Sunday. He was appointed as head coach in November 2024, but has now decided that the job title isn't good enough for him. He wants the power afforded to Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho, despite not having the CV to match.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear,\" he said. \"I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "\"If people cannot handle the Gary Neville and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club. No, guys, I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. And every department, the scouting department, the sports director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"",
      "This clearly isn't someone angling for a new contract. Amorim will see out his 18 months, but it seems he is saying that if this structure remains, he will leave then.",
      "He is unlikely to last another 18 months, however. Wilcox is right to have doubts over Amorim's tactical approach, but the uncomfortable reality for this United structure under Sir Jim Ratcliffe is that they have bet the house on the Portuguese. If he fails, where does it leave them?",
      "In a way, Wilcox, Vivell, Amorim and even chief executive Omar Berrada will now look to Ratcliffe for the next move. The minority owner hasn't been to a game since the 4-1 win against Wolves on December 8 and things have clearly changed since then.",
      "Ratcliffe can be unpredictable. He likes Amorim and admires his straight-talking approach, but there is shooting from the hip and then there is this. It was unfriendly fire.",
      "The 73-year-old billionaire showed his ruthless streak when getting rid of Dan Ashworth after just five months. That was put down to a personality clash, but Ratcliffe was frustrated that Ashworth was raising concerns about the appointment of Amorim. There is more than a degree of irony to that now.",
      "So what will Ratcliffe do next? He was talking of giving Amorim three years in October, but that now looks impossible. It's hard to see how Wilcox and Amorim can continue to coexist for much longer. It wouldn't be out of character for Ratcliffe to look to end this one way or another this week.",
      "Perhaps results will dictate what happens next, at least to a degree. Amorim will face the media at Carrington on Tuesday, and it feels inconceivable that he won't have met Wilcox for showdown talks before then. Can they come up with a New Year's truce? If they don't, then Amorim will badly need a win at Burnley.",
      "His hand isn't exactly strong at the moment, but then he has never been one to bite his tongue either.",

      "Here are how the players rated at Elland Road:",
      "Senne Lammens: Could possibly have done better for the goal but two smart second-half saves from Gudmundsson and Okafor and his distribution was sound under pressure. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Couple of nervy moments as we have come to expect. Can be too easy to get in behind down the right side at the moment. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: One well-timed tackle in the box when at first it had looked a reckless move. Good in possession but caught napping for the goal. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing was good and showed plenty of aggression when defending. Back on the left of the back three and clearly more suited to that role. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Some slack moments in possession and too casual in giving it away for the first goal. Right flank exposed at times. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: One of his best games of the season, with conditions to suit. Didn't do loads in possession but was good without the ball and set a really combative tone. 7",
      "Casemiro: Better on the ball than Ugarte and also competed well. Midfield looked like a potential weakness for United but it didn't really work out that way. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Corners were dangerous and made one excellent defensive header. Back in a position he hasn't played for several years but put up a good showing. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Being moved about all over the place at the moment and not helping him. Screwed one first-half chance just wide. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: United's best player. Carried the fight in the first and clearly the best player on the pitch. Deserved his goal and looked lively. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Amorim on his case over hold-up play early on. Involved in the goal but poor centre-forward play to be offside for a bad header and then missed a good chance to win it. 5",
      "Substitutes",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: A rare Amorim sub that showed intent and it paid off. Good ball to set up Cunha for the equalising goal and had some good moments as a No.10. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Fredricson, Kukonki, Malacia, Mantato, J. Fletcher, T. Fletcher, Lacey.",

      "Another weekend, another Manchester United performance overshadowed by Ruben Amorim’s post-match comments. The head coach’s explosive words after the draw with Leeds United have put his future under scrutiny once more, but it’s far from the first time.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" the former Sporting CP boss said.",

And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Whether Amorim sees out his contract, which runs until the end of the 2026/27 season, remains to be seen. However, if you think an Amorim outburst about his future will necessarily be followed by a decision from on high, you haven’t been paying attention.",
      "There was plenty of pressure on Amorim in his first season. \"I know that if we don't win, regardless if they pay the buyout or not, every manager is in danger,\" he said in December 2024 after a tough run of early results, and he didn’t shy away from further comments.",
      "The following month, he didn’t explicitly threaten to quit but acknowledged the drop-off after replacing Erik ten Hag in the dugout. \"In ten games in the Premier League, we won two,\" he said after a defeat to Brighton.",
      "\"Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach that is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.",
      "\"We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\"",
      "A run to the Europa League final might have made up for domestic struggles had United won in Bilbao. When they were beaten by Spurs, however, the boss pre-empted some of those doubts and said he would leave the very next day if that’s what the board wanted.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, is not my style,\" he said. \"I cannot do it, is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing.",
      "\"In this moment, it’s a little bit of faith. So let’s see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United spent big over the summer, with Amorim given £200million worth of attacking talent and a new goalkeeper in the form of Senne Lammens. Within weeks of the new season starting, though, he was once again threatening to walk away.",
      "\"We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And then that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything,\" Amorim said after a shock Carabao cup elimination at the hands of Grimsby Town. \"But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one.",
      "\"If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that.",
      "\"And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard. But now I'm good with the next one.\"",
      "He also made it clear he wasn’t going to apologise for how he felt, explaining: \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.",
      "\"I think this is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that in that moment I was so frustrated and [annoyed]. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have.\"",
      "Amorim’s latest comments have also drawn a response from Gary Neville, who has noticed a change in the Portuguese’s demeanour in recent days. \"Something has happened in the last week which means that Amorim is starting to unleash a little bit,\" he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "\"It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy. Obviously something is annoying him - he's obviously not feeling the support. He's obviously letting go.",
      "\"When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.\"",
      "This may yet end up being Amorim’s final quit threat if the higher-ups decide to call his bluff. If he stays in charge, though, we’ve already seen he isn’t afraid to put his job on the line.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has launched a scathing attack on Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim, branding the Portuguese boss a 'barely competent' top-flight manager. The criticism follows Amorim's controversial post-match press conference after the draw with Leeds United, in which he publicly criticised United's sporting director, Jason Wilcox, and former defender Gary Neville.",
      "Amorim declared he wanted to be the manager of the team rather than a head coach, seeking authority over every department, including scouting. He specifically mentioned Neville and challenged Wilcox to fulfil his responsibilities, while Amorim focuses on his own role.",
      "The remarks have provoked a fierce response from Carragher, who has condemned the United boss for his unwillingness to alter his tactical approach and dismissed suggestions that Amorim had been inadequately supported.",
      "\"It started to look like maybe he was getting somewhere moving to a back four, he went back to five at the back against Wolves and it brought possibly one of the worst performances of the season from a team. No matter what it is, I don't think he is in any position whatsoever to be questioning the people who appointed him.",
      "\"He's not good enough. He's not good enough to be Manchester United's manager. He's barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now. That's not me being disrespectful to Amorim.",
      "\"He's been there well over 12 months now and I think almost all managers in the Premier League who are managing different clubs at different ends of the table would look at Manchester United and think 'I'd get more points than that.' This is a guy who said at one stage this is possibly the worst Manchester United team in history. He's managing it.\"",
      "In response to the suggestion that Amorim had not received sufficient support, Carragher retorted: \"He's been more than backed. He couldn't have had too many complaints if the club parted company with him in the summer, given how poor last season was.",
      "\"They then went into the market and spent a lot of money. I'm sure he was heavily involved in that. He's playing a system that is not in the traditions of Man United, so there was no way they could go out and recruit all the attacking players, and the wing backs and perhaps the centre backs.",
      "\"It was going to be a long-term plan in terms of windows. He can't be complaining now about the funds in January. Manchester United spent a huge amount in the summer. Don't forget, they had no Champions League football, no European football and a lot of that was down to him.",
      "\"Let's not forget, when he was brought in, the idea was to get them back to Champions League football. They were four points off the Champions League when he came in. They finished 15th. So when you talk about the lack of funds, that was down to him and the team, and there's no way he's going to get everything he wants in one window.\"",
      "He added: \"Of course they need need better players but it can't come in one window. He - or the club - decided to go with attacking players, they could have maybe gone with one midfielder, one attacking player, one wing-back but they didn't and maybe they'll come in future windows.",
      "\"But the people he seems to be having a go at - (chief executive) Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox - they're the ones who brought him in and were probably the ones who were fighting in the summer to keep him in a job. I'm sure Jim Ratcliffe is looking at the situation and thinking you've brought in a guy, he doesn't play the way Manchester United have in the past and the results are horrendous.\"",
      "Carragher drew parallels between Amorim's remarks and Enzo Maresca's recent public criticism at Chelsea, which led to his exit from Stamford Bridge. He stated: \"This could be over very quickly. But Maresca was in a much stronger position to challenge his board and the owner than Amorim.",
      "\"He won the Club World Cup. He got the team into the Champions League. He did everything he was asked to do last season. I still didn't think it was acceptable to challenge the people above him.",
      "\"Amorim is in no position whatsoever to speak like that. As I said, he's a barely competent Premier League manager so far on what he has shown.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "This is what happens when you roll the dice, Ruben. Five days after another negative substitution angered Manchester United fans at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim showed some intent from the bench at Elland Road and got his rewards.",
      "Maybe Amorim had little option but to play the role of the gambler in West Yorkshire. He had picked a team featuring eight defensive players, and once Brenden Aaronson had given Leeds the lead, it was time to play his chips.",
      "But the speed at which Amorim did so was still surprising. Before the game had even restarted, Joshua Zirkzee was stripped and ready to come on, and Leny Yoro was trudging towards the touchline.",
      "Three minutes later, Zirkzee found a pocket of space he would exploit regularly in a lively cameo, and his pass through was rolled in by Matheus Cunha. United found the immediate response they needed - and deserved - and any danger of this assignment getting as uncomfortable as it could have done petered out.",
      "Will this convince Amorim to be more gung-ho in the future? Perhaps not. But it does feel like things are changing at Old Trafford. The head coach has mixed up his system recently, whether through his own design or orders from above, and his comments in Friday's press conference suggested unity might suddenly be in short supply.",
      "That dire draw at home to Wolves to end 2025 had certainly dialled up the pressure once again and back-to-back trips to promoted sides Leeds and Burnley had the feel of a litmus test at the start of a New Year. Amorim's resources are stretched right now and he bemoaned the misfortune of missing his most creative players at the same time before this game.",
      "That suggested this would never be a classic. And it wasn't. In the circumstances, a point isn't a bad result. At least it won't be if United win at Turf Moor on Wednesday. This was always the tougher of the two games.",
      "Lisandro Martinez attempted to defuse some of the noise by turning the teams around after winning the toss. As the inoffensive Senne Lammens made his way to the North Stand goal he was greeted with chants of \"scum\". Two minutes after kick-off, all bar 3,000 United fans crammed into a corner of Elland Road rose to their feet for a chant of \"stand up if you hate Man U\".",
      "But the temperature in the stands and on the pitch quickly dipped on a bitterly cold afternoon. It wasn't a game to keep the fires burning and chances were few and far between. Cunha's dipping volley into the back of the net from 25 yards was a rare moment of quality, but the offside flag had long since been up against Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko's struggles to hold the ball up earned him a rebuke from Amorim, but United's build-up play had been neat, even if chances were hard to create. Their best opportunities came from corners, with Diogo Dalot screwing a shot over from 10 yards, Leny Yoro's header from close range being tipped over by Lucas Perri and the lively Cunha hitting a 15-yard volley over the bar.",
      "It was Leeds who came closest to breaking the deadlock. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was clearly the best striker on the pitch, and he began the move by holding the ball up before making his way into the box to head Anton Stach's cross against a post.",
      "The evidence of the first half hour suggested we could have played all day and not got a goal. Then two came along in four minutes. The opener summed up the game.",
      "Pascal Struijk's swing of the boot inside his own half was a clearance after Dalot had overrun the ball, but United were caught napping defensively, and Aaronson darted in behind Ayden Heaven to finish. Amorim reacted immediately, sending Zirkzee on for Yoro, and he got his reward for an adventurous sub.",
      "Sesko got hold of the ball and laid it off to Zirkzee, whose ball in behind was well-weighted to allow Cunha to slide a finish past Perri.",
      "The glut of goals proved to be a false dawn in terms of quality. Sesko side-footed wide from a Zirkzee cross when he should have done better and substitute Joel Piroe sent a late effort onto the roof of the net.",
      "Zirkzee was lively in his half-hour cameo despite the expectation of a departure in this window. The fact that he was the only replacement Amorim turned to showed what few options he had on the bench.",
      "Amorim is focusing on surviving while key men are missing, but three wins from 11 since October is a missed opportunity and momentum has well and truly stalled. This performance was an improvement on Tuesday, but its true context might only be revealed if United can get back to winning ways on Wednesday.",

      "Gary Lineker believes Ruben Amorim was making a pitch with his outburst that put his Manchester United future in doubt.",
      "Following his side’s 1-1 draw with Leeds United on Sunday, Amorim delivered an explosive press conference in which he insisted he is the manager, not the coach, of United and challenged his sporting director and scouting department “to do their job”. He also hinted he could leave when his current deal runs out in 18 months' time – if he isn't sacked before then.",
      "And Lineker believes that Amorim was attempting to tell the world that he is only coaching, without getting much of a say in terms of recruitment and lacking support from those above him.",
      "He said: “It was an odd one, wasn’t it? I think it was a little bit like the [Enzo] Maresca comments two or three weeks ago.",
      "“It seems to me like he’s making a pitch here – I’m not managing, I’m only coaching, I’m not really getting much say in terms of new players, I’m not really getting much support. That’s how I read it.”",
      "“I don’t think he’s got enough in the bank to be moaning,” Shearer told the Rest is Football podcast. “It’s not as if he’s come into the Premier League to manage Manchester United and been amazing.”",
      "Lineker agreed before Shearer continued: “Look at the results and record since he’s been the manager of Manchester United. It’s been nowhere near good enough.”",
      "Speaking at Elland Road, Amorim said: “Guys, to stop with that - and I noticed that you receive selective information about everything - I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.",
      "“That is clear. I know that my name is not Tuchel, it’s not Conte, it’s not Mourinho, but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",
      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy comes here to replace me.”",
      "Before he added: “I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach.",
      "“I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months. And then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club. Every department, the scouting department, the sports director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.”",

      "Ruben Amorim backed Benjamin Sesko to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed despite the £73million striker struggling once again at Elland Road. Sesko has just two goals in 17 games since his move from RB Leipzig and missed a good chance to win the game for Manchester United at Leeds as his struggles in front of goal continued.",
      "United jettisoned Hojlund to replace him with the Slovenian striker but have watched the Dane enjoy a positive start to life at Napoli, with nine goals in 20 games since his loan move to Serie A. There are similarities between the pair, both 22 and struggling initially as they make the step up to life at Old Trafford, but Amorim is confident the new man has the profile to be a success at the club.",
      "\"Is the characteristics of the player,\" said Amorim. \"Ben is completely different from Rasmus. Rasmus had this moment here. He moved on, we bring Sesko. He will try to score goals. The pressure of being the striker for Manchester United, he's doing the right things. He needs to improve them the last moment. That is the most important moment because he did things that he did well today, he just needs to score one.",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing is always there and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side, he's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong, I don't agree.",
      "\"I think he's in the right position, he just needs to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",
      "Sesko showed some frustration in the first-half with wing-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw and it was a theme of Hojlund's time at the club that he felt the service into him wasn't quick enough, but Amorim rejected that idea and said his side were right to show patience in build-up.",
      "\"If you tell me that in the different game today, we need to have possessions, especially in this kind of environment,\" he said. \"If we are losing the ball all the time, if we are trying to be the team that we were in the past with a lot of transitions all the time, we don't want to play like that.",
      "\"We want to prepare better the way we played. We played better compared to the last week and we were very lucky. We talked two seconds ago about the chances that Ben had, so we are creating chances for Ben. He just needs to score one and then all the weight is going to go. So we are creating chances for the strikers.\"",

      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Elsewhere on the first day of 2026, Liverpool lumbered to a goalless draw with Leeds at Anfield. Arne Slot's side have picked up better results recently, but they still aren't playing well and are having to grind out results every week.",
      "With the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa edging clear, it might be that two from three of United, Chelsea and Liverpool will qualify for the Champions League, presuming the Premier League can land that fifth spot once again for next season.",
      "There will be honourable mentions for Sunderland and Everton, who have had excellent first halves of the season, while the league is so congested that only five points separate Chelsea in fifth from Brighton in 14th. A good run of form could propel any number of clubs into the mix.",
      "For United, they would probably have taken this at the halfway stage of the campaign. They are sixth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference and three points shy of Liverpool. Qualification for the Champions League is attainable this season.",
      "The concern is that a woeful run at home might look costly come the end of the season. They have taken three points from home games against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves. The first of those played with 10 men for the best part of 80 minutes and the other three were - and still are - in poor form.",
      "United will have to improve to make the top five, but possibly not by much. Liverpool still look like a flawed team, and Chelsea are unpredictable. The departure of Maresca might change things, but a young and inexperienced squad will be tested in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Amorim's side haven't taken advantage of a kinder fixture list recently and now face Manchester City and Arsenal in January, but having put themselves in a position to achieve what was the primary objective this season, they should consider rolling the dice this month.",
      "Interest in Antoine Semenyo waned when it became clear he wanted to move to Manchester City, but United's willingness to do a deal suggests there is money available to improve the squad. The conditions for a January deal are that the focus remains on long-term targets and adding real quality this month can be difficult to do.",
      "Beefing up numbers to compensate for the lack of depth is also an issue that should ease as the month progresses. Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes should all be back fit soon and Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be back from the Africa Cup of Nations by January 19 at the latest.",
      "But United should be and are alert to opportunities in midfield, with question marks over the futures of several key players. There is also uncertainty as to whether Mainoo will push for a loan move if his chances of first-team football don't improve over the next couple of weeks.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is also eyeing up a move to Roma. His departure could leave Amorim short of attacking opportunities, with Benjamin Sesko the only natural centre-forward in the squad. Finding a permanent replacement might not be easy, but adding a striker to the squad to offer support and cover for Sesko could be beneficial.",
      "These kinds of January deals might only move the needle ever so slightly; they might only be worth a point or two come the final calculations, but in what is shaping up to be a tight race for places in the top five, that might be all it takes to make them value for money.",
      "At the halfway stage, United have put themselves in the conversation. Now they need to do all they can to finish the job.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to be fit before the end of January, but the midfielder could remain at Manchester United for the rest of the season, rather than being loaned out again. The 21-year-old was officially recalled from his loan with Championship side West Brom on New Year's Day, but he has been at Carrington since the end of November after suffering a calf injury with the Baggies.",
      "Collyer struggled for game time before suffering his injury setback, starting just three Championship games and making 12 appearances in total. After sustaining his injury, he has been undergoing rehabilitation with his parent club. He could have returned to the Hawthorns when fit, but United have made the decision to recall him from a planned season-long loan due to concerns over his playing time in the Midlands, as well as his injury issue.",
      "The former Brighton youngster is expected to be fit again by the end of this month, having not featured competitively since sustaining a calf injury during West Brom’s 1-1 draw with Birmingham City in late November.",
      "Collyer will be monitored now that he is back at United and could stay at the club for the remainder of the season if Ruben Amorim decides to keep him as part of the first-team squad.",
      "The midfielder has made 13 appearances for United, 10 of which came under Amorim last season. Although United will have a light schedule in the second half of the season, there is uncertainty over the futures of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with both attracting loan interest.",
      "If Collyer plays for United this month, it would prohibit another loan move, as players can only play for two clubs during a season. If he doesn't feature, then another loan switch to play first-team football remains an option.",

      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "Diomande has been named as a possible alternative target to Antoine Semenyo for United. The Bournemouth man looks to be heading to rivals Manchester City, despite interest from United, leaving Ruben Amorim's side looking at other potential options moving forward.",
      "While RB Leipzig will be keen to keep hold of their young talent, it's been hinted that a big offer could tempt the German club into cashing-in on his signature.",
      "In an interview with German outlet Welt, Mintzlaff said: \"We want to ensure that we don't just develop players for one year. But that we can also retain top talents for longer.",
      "\"We still see ourselves as a top club in the Bundesliga. And for young players like (Assan) Ouedraogo or Diomande, it would be good to take the next steps with us and consistently perform at a high level.",
      "\"However, it will remain the case in the future that we will occasionally have to let our players go. We still need to generate transfer fees and have players in our squad who are attractive to absolute top clubs.",
      "\"Generally speaking, you should never rule anything out in football. If there's an exorbitant offer far above market value, and we are convinced that it's a unique opportunity for a significant profit, then we have to be honest with ourselves, discuss it, and keep a cool head.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is currently on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty with the Ivory Coast. So far this season, he has scored six times and provided a further three assists in 14 Bundesliga games.",
      "United are not alone in their interest with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain also claimed to be tracking his development closely.",
      "While the comments are seemingly positive news for United, it doesn't necessarily mean they will launch a move during the January window - or even next summer.",
      "It's reported that United are not certain to pursue an alternative to Semenyo in the upcoming window, but could potentially accelerate their interest if other clubs do.",
      "Instead, that might in turn be one for future windows, with eyes also on midfield targets. The position has been identified as a priority for United with names such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba all being linked.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",
      "It didn't work and although United were missing key players in Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim refused to use those absences as an excuse, but admitted he knew why his side had struggled.",
      "\"That is normal but we didn't use that excuse against Newcastle, we are not going to use it today,\" he said. \"But of course if you see the game I understand why we play the way we play today.",
      "\"The lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle because in Newcastle we have more space to play. We didn't have to work the plays so much and today we have.\"",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "We’re basing this Premier League XI on WhoScored ratings, which essentially means Opta statistics and algorithms that generally reward ‘doing stuff’, so aerially dominant centre-halves are far more likely to be included than calm passers.",
      "Anyway, here we go. At this stage, all candidates must have started 11 of 18 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "The gloves have been making the short trip across the River Tyne all season, as Nick Pope has shared custody largely thanks to a relatively impressive six clean sheets in 14 games. But Roefs has shone in his debut campaign for Sunderland, conceding once from the eight shots on target he faced against Manchester City and Spurs.",
      "",
      "There was no right-back in the PFA Team of the Year for 2024/25 but Arsenal’s Timber might be impossible to ignore this time around. He returned from a remarkably brief injury to set up Leandro Trossard’s goal against Aston Villa, the defender’s sixth such involvement in 19 games.",
      "",
      "At this stage of the season, there is a bias in favour of defenders with goal contributions, and Gabriel has three goals and two assists. But he is also the best centre-half in the Premier League bar none. The Gunners will have been very pleased indeed to see him come off the bench v Brighton and pick up where he left off.",
      "",
      "The very same defender who was run ragged by Brentford and Igor Thiago at the Hill Dickinson. But Tarkowski ranks first for shots blocked, second for aerial duels won and fourth for clearances in the Premier League this season. And ultimately the algorithm loves that.",
      "",
      "Slim pickings at left-back – unlike at right-back – with O’Reilly emerging from the pack with a goal and three assists from left-back. It’s also booked him a place to the World Cup with England.",
      "",
      "The best signing of this and indeed most Premier League seasons. Future promoted sides will convince themselves they can procure a Xhaka of their own when coming straight up from the Championship but his blend of experience, leadership, control and availability is not the sort which comes on the market all that often. Sunderland struck gold.",
      "",
      "Probably the best central midfielder in the top flight bar none. And that before he started popping up at right-back and dragging his side to crucial victories from behind.",
      "",
      "Finally added Premier League assists two and three to his name against Brighton and Bournemouth to add to his four goals. You might argue that Antoine Semenyo’s raw numbers are much more impressive (they are) but Saka almost never loses the ball. He is not flashy but he is incredibly consistent and reliable.",
      "",
      "Move over Eberechi Eze. Foden now has seven Premier League goals this season after a double in that mental game v Fulham, another v Sunderland and another brace at Crystal Palace. It’s interesting that three City players emerge at the top of WhoScored’s players of the season. But then they have scored the most goals…",
      "As for Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers; WhoScored rate him as the 37th best player in the Premier League this season. Why? His pass completion rate is poor, he contributes very little defensively and only one player in the whole top flight loses the ball more often from a poor touch.",
      "",
      "Absolutely phenomenal against Liverpool, he scored a goal, won a penalty, dribbled past seven players and created three chances. He then created four chances against Newcastle United but was overshadowed by Harvey Barnes. Only Kudus dribbles past more players but Doku has more end product this season and loses the ball a whole lot less. Back from injury and keeping his place for now.",
      "",
      "Just casually strolling towards the Golden Boot with 19 Premier League goals in his first 19 games. He looks sharp and he looks absolutely brilliant, clearly taking the summer spend on outrageously expensive strikers as a personal affront. Still the best? Absolutely.",
      "Arne Slot, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez and Richard Hughes all take a particular paddling in an eclectic Mailbox which covers Arsenal, West Ham and more too.",
      "West Ham have already sacked one manager this season and could be about to sack another; old boys are favourites for the job.",
      "Mikel Arteta enjoyed Arsenal proving something they rarely have the chance to, as they took ‘the next step in terms of individual personality and presence’.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo surely cannot continue as West Ham manager after that Wolves debacle, but their £47m January investment means he almost has to stay.",
      "There is no need for football to reinvent itself, just for sustainability to be seen as central rather than peripheral. Following Tottenham would help.",
      "Gary Lineker thinks Arsenal star Gabriel Magalhaes is the best centre-back in “world football”, while Micah Richards has praised Gabriel Jesus."

      "A wonderfully chaotic option for Spurs and a man seemingly doomed forever to score spectacularly memorable goals in spectacularly memorable disasters. Which is really just unimprovably Tottenham of him.",

      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line.",
      "",
      "Given he was the wrong profile of striker for Newcastle entirely, bought in a performative panic after everyone else had said no, and given that Newcastle haven’t really been any good this season, it’s to Woltemade’s huge credit that he’s escaped a seemingly certain floppy fate. But he’s not going to win the Golden Boot, is he?",

      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to your Semenyos and Thiagos – doing much compelling to challenge him.",

      "Amorim has been under pressure for most of his time at Man Utd, though he fuelled exit speculation by dropping a remarkable outburst following his side’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United on Sunday.",
      "He said: “I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not the just the coach, and I was really clear on that.",
      "“That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That is the deal, that is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.”",

      "There have been suggestions that the Red Devils hierarchy have butted heads with Amorim over his system, with it looking increasingly likely that the relationship between the head coach and the board may be beyond repair.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk has shed light on Man Utd’s ‘contingency plan’, with it claimed that they have ‘two options’ to replace Amorim",
      "He explained: ‘One of those, who would likely be a short-term option, is Michael Carrick. The former Middlesbrough man has previously served in the coaching set-up and is held in huge regard by the club. We are told that the club would like him to be involved again at some point in the future.",
      "‘There is also Sir Gareth Southgate, who is someone that Ratcliffe remains a huge fan of. Wilcox too is believed to have huge respect for the former England boss, and he is currently available.’",

Because he’s not good enough. He’s not good enough to be Manchester United’s manager. He’s barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now.”",
      "Pressed on what might be the cause of Amorim’s gripes, Carragher suggested: “It can only be two things. It can either be about the January transfer market, that he’s not being backed. Or the people above him are questioning that he’s flip-flopping between systems.",
      "“It started to look like he was getting somewhere with a back four, he went back to a five at the back against Wolves and it was possibly the worst performance from a team we’ve seen against Wolves this season.”",

      "Neville continued: “Obviously, something is annoying him, he’s obviously not feeling the support. He’s obviously letting go. When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.",
      "“Manager is a title that we don’t see anymore. Manager suggests that he’s saying he wants to manage more than just the training ground performance, he wants to oversee other parts of the club.",
      "“I played under a manager and they basically have a greater say in what would be other parts of the club including recruitment, academy, style of play, pre-season friendlies and other things.",
      "“I think he’s suggesting that he needs to be given the ability to manage more departments of the club.",
      "“I actually thought against Leeds, defensively United were very strong. I thought they were very solid in the game I thought they handled the atmosphere well. I thought they fully deserved the point out of the game that’s why I was surprised at the end to hear of Ruben Amorim’s comments because I thought you’ve got a point away from home.",
      "“You’ve just had a disastrous result against Wolves at home but there’s Burnley to go in three days, there’s no real need for a fire right now but there’s a fire being created.",
      "“He’s always been authentic, he’s always had integrity in his press conferences. He’s always said what he believes and he thinks and he should do, he should carry on as he was but it does look like he’s now starting to point upwards which ordinarily does bring pressure with it.”",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has insisted that he will be a “manager, not coach” at Old Trafford as promised on his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils continued their inconsistent form on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Leeds United at Elland Road.",
      "A clinical Matheus Cunha finish got Man Utd back on level terms on 65 minutes, just three minutes after Leeds attacker Brenden Aaronson took advantage of an Ayden Heaven mistake to give the Yorkshire side the lead.",
      "The nature of division means that the Red Devils are likely to finish the day only a few points from the bottom half of the Premier League.",
      "Amid reports of tension between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox, the Man Utd boss gave a clear warning to the board.",
      "READ: Man Utd don’t lose at Leeds and that’s just fine for negative Ruben Amorim",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not Conte, Tuchel, Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",
      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit. I’ll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”",
      "Reacting to his side’s performance against Leeds, the Man Utd boss said: “In the Premier League, it is hard to find a game you are satisfied with a draw, that is why it is an amazing league.",
      "“Overall, if you see the game we had more control. We created more chances, we controlled well, so if you look at the game you feel the frustration that we had the chance to win. It is a tough match in tough conditions.",
      "“The game plan was to understand what we did wrong against Wolves. We improved a lot because we were in the right positions. We improved from the last game.",
      "“It’s strange because they started a little bit better in the second half. When we are in control, we need to be focused in every detail. We know against West Ham, we are in control then one disconnection, there was a goal. We need to be connected all the time.",
      "“We managed to control our emotions and to score the next goal, and we had a big chance. I think we deserved a little better, but it’s okay.”",
      "“We had our opportunities to win the game. We are losing games on the details – the Leeds goal, we are controlling the game and then one kick of the ball in transition but we managed to get back into the game. Last year it would be completely different. This year we are more in control of the games than we were last year but we are frustrated not to win.”",
      "On the Leeds goal, the Man Utd boss continued: “Ayden and Leny are really young but it is not because of that. If you play so well during 90m minutes and you have a mistake that can happen. If you look at the game we had chances to score the second one and nobody would be talking about the goal of Leeds.”",
      "On goalscorer Cunha, he said: “Not just him but Josh [Zirkzee] played well in the 20 minutes he had, Ben [Sesko] linked the play well today, Ugarte is showing that he has more to give, and I am really pleased. If these guys play well we always have the chance to win the game.”",
      "When asked about the January transfer window, he replied: “United is one of the best clubs in the world. If you are here and focusing on a different club then something is wrong with you. Just focus on the game and prepare with the players that we have. We have more too, I expect more minutes for Fernandes and Mount, so we have more players that can help us.”",
      "Manchester United already reportedly have a ‘contingency plan’ if they part ways with Ruben Amorim, with ‘two options’ in the frame to replace him.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim wanted to sign Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins over Benjamin Sesko amid his shock outburst at the Red Devils hierarchy.",
      "Fabrizio Romano insists Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is “not happy” with “tension behind the scenes” between him and the board.",
      "Man United didn’t lose at Leeds and Ruben Amorim will be perfectly happy with that after starting eight defensive players at Elland Road.",
      "Manchester United head of recruitment Christopher Vivell has reportedly ‘privately’ hit out at head coach Ruben Amorim over his tactics.",

      "Manchester United have only drawn 0-0 once since Ruben Amorim’s arrival. For an hour against Leeds United, it appeared they were heading for another, a result Amorim’s team selection suggested he would have accepted before kick-off.",
      "There was plenty of criticism of Amorim’s starting XI at Elland Road as he lined up with eight defensive players in his adored 3-4-2-1 formation. Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back, was part of a front three alongside Matheus Cunha and an out-of-form Benjamin Sesko, whose poor touches, finishing and hold-up play epitomised his difficult acclimatisation from the Bundesliga to the Premier League. To be fair to him, he’s not alone.",
      "Amorim knows Leeds don’t have incredible quality on the ball or the ability to freely play through teams, so selecting more defensive players makes a certain amount of sense. It does, however, make for an awfully dull game of football and points to a mentality problem: ‘don’t lose’ rather than ‘let’s win’. Against a newly promoted team, albeit one in good form, that feels wrong.",
      "That team selection did allow Manchester United greater control, with the back three rarely tested against Premier League form striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose first real sniff at goal came from a free header that hit the post and had half of Elland Road convinced it was in. Leny Yoro ought to have been tighter to the England hopeful and also should have put the visitors 1-0 up with a header of his own, which would have done his confidence the world of good. He needs it.",
      "There wasn’t much to report until Brenden Aaronson’s opening goal in the 62nd minute. Amorim’s XI was a contributing factor, but so too was the kick-off time, something we completely understand given the job West Yorkshire Police would have on their hands if Leeds vs Manchester United were an 8pm fixture.",
      "It was all just a bit flat. Scheduling this fixture as early as possible is understandable, but it was also a bit boring. We are not condoning drunk and disorderly behaviour by any means, but we want these two great rivals to meet in the best atmosphere possible.",
      "MORE F365 SAYS…\n* Arsenal take ‘the next step’ as Arteta pinpoints one player’s ‘personality and presence’ in huge win\n* Nuno sack sealed but West Ham have already given 47 million reasons why he must stay for relegation\n* Thomas Frank doesn’t ‘understand’ Spurs and Brentford stalemate suggests he never will",
      "Elland Road did erupt when Aaronson slotted past Senne Lammens, but the home fans were instantly silenced when Matheus Cunha equalised.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven won’t look back fondly on the American’s goal when it’s analysed on Monday morning, especially after such a solid, composed performance up to that point. Perhaps it was that very composure and confidence that caught him out, as Aaronson bore down on the lackadaisical defender, burst through on goal and finished with his left foot.",
      "Amorim’s reaction was immediate. Joshua Zirkzee came on and provided the assist for Cunha’s finish. When United needed to attack, they scored a brilliant goal and looked good value for a winner. Why couldn’t they have just done this from the start? Everyone’s day would have been far more entertaining.",
      "Zirkzee was one of United’s better players despite only playing 31 minutes, but Cunha was also impressive and scored the decisive equaliser. He was trying to make things happen from the first minute and also struck an exquisite volley that was ruled out for offside against Sesko.",
      "Aaronson’s opener could have sparked the game into life, but Cunha’s swift equaliser burst that bubble. The second half was a better spectacle and became hectic in injury time, but we were still left wanting more from Amorim’s side. A draw ultimately felt like a fair result.",
      "Leeds are now on their best unbeaten run in the Premier League since 2001, extending it to seven games.",
      "United have still only drawn 0-0 once under Amorim, against Manchester City on April 6 at Old Trafford, and 15 of their Premier League games in 2025/26 have seen both teams score. Leeds sit fourth in that particular table. Both delivered with goals at Elland Road, but it wasn’t the game we were hoping for.",

      "Any such deal whether now or in the summer is likely to cost at least £100m and United may be tempted to look at cheaper alternatives such as Lille’s Ayyoub Bouaddi and Olympiacos’ Christos Mouzakitis. Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson is also attracting plenty of suitors.",
      "Amorim has already suggested that the club will not be making any signings in the January window, stating the squad is already good enough for its objectives.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘informed’ those involved that they will not be proceeding with a £15m transfer involving midfielder Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte has proven to be a massive flop since joining the Red Devils for around £50m during the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "It was hoped that Ugarte could return to form following his reunion with Ruben Amorim at Man Utd after they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, but this is not how it has panned out.",
      "Ugarte is not good enough to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement as he is very limited in possession and has fallen behind the Brazil international in the pecking order this season.",
      "This has fuelled reports linking the Uruguay international with an exit in January or next summer, while Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are also linked with moves elsewhere.",
      "Despite this, Amorim has claimed this week that there are “not” going to be any changes to Man Utd’s squad this month.",

      "Therefore, it is hardly surprising that a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk claims ‘United have rebuffed advances from intermediaries working to take Ugarte to Turkish giants Galatasaray’.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Gala’s plan had been to take Ugarte on loan with an option to buy, and they were prepared to pay a hefty loan fee of around £15million (€17.5m, $20m). But with Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, both keen to secure exits in January, Ugarte has been told that it will not happen.",
      "‘There is, however, a belief that if Gala came back with an offer that would see United pocket close to the original £45million they paid PSG in August 2024 for him, then they might have a chance of landing him this month.’",
      "Regarding Amorim’s comments, Fabrizio Romano has claimed that a “message has been communicated” to INEOS regarding transfers.",
      "“Today Ruben Amorim was very clear in his press conference. He said that as of now, no player has come to his office asking to leave the club,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“The manager’s position is very simple. If any player leaves Manchester United in the January transfer window, there must be a replacement. No one will leave without a replacement coming in.",
      "“This message has been communicated publicly and privately.",
      "“With the AFCON ongoing, it is very difficult for United to let players go, and this is why targets like Kobbie Mainoo or Joshua Zirkzee are not expected to move unless solutions are found.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the latest on Rodrygo’s future amid rumours Arsenal have made an offer for the Brazil international.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

      "Playing alongside John McGinn remains a tantalising prospect for most professionals.",
      "",
      "It is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "Ozhianvuna will join on a four-and-a-half-year contract with add-ons which could double the initial fee and a sell-on clause, having caught Arsenal’s eye during a 2023 summer tournament staged at the club’s academy, while impressing in some LOI cameos and even the Conference League.",
      "",
      "“I can’t even believe you will be playing at sort of that level with pressure on you at 15,” said Gary Neville, who also implored the world to “definitely just let him breathe, let him enjoy himself” and not “put too much pressure on him”.",
      "Sullivan signed the richest homegrown contract in MLS history at just 14, contained within which is a clause tying him to a pre-arranged transfer to Manchester City when he turns a positively ancient 18.",
      "The midfielder has built quite the reputation on the youth scene at club and international level, attracting interest from Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.",

      "At that time, technically two years ago now, I remembering writing in to say nobody would have Maresca at their club, that he was extraordinarily lucky to be at Stamford Bridge. Obviously Maresca’s stock rose and oh how the turn tables and all that, because it became BlueCo who were indeed extraordinarily lucky to have employed Maresca. Because honestly what manager in world football with the proper bonafides / in their right minds / with timely options would want to go and manage Chelsea these days.",
      "The top three look solidly entrenched, so Liverpool and Chelsea are the likeliest two to compete for the final musical chair spot for next season. To me, on balance, it’s a coin flip. Either team could get in, or ffs maybe Sunderland surge to third and push Villa into fourth and wouldn’t that just be incredible for the league and also boil vats of Magpie piss. But between Liverpool and Chelsea at least, it’s very clear which owners I’d rather work for, and while I won’t be baited by all of Will Ford’s low-hanging anti-Liverpool fruit, sometimes I do feel compelled to say something in defence of my club.\nEric, Los Angeles CA (But I’m a good sport… even the anti-Liverpool fruit can be nutritious on its day.)",

There are rumours that City could let him leave and at the start of the season he was looking pretty good.",

      "I might sound a bit harsh here but if you have a dressing room where very few speak English as a first language and most left school at 16 I assume it’s mostly not Hadron Collider type stuff.",
      "But what is the focus? Does Pep focus on weaknesses to be exploited and then pick a team to achieve that? So the players go out knowing they wanna run down the left more and that’s about it?",
      "I know Henry did that thing about positioning and how Pep at Barca basically was very rigid about positioning until the ball went into the final third. But that still seems fairly simple no? Helps your team be more confident about where people will be in order to exploit space.",
      "Arteta and Howe are obviously focused on tactical fouls as a way of dealing with transition whilst Klopp used to like the idea of counter pressing and creating tactical traps. But again none of this is insanely complicated. So what’s the difference between coaching standards and why did Ferguson get more out of players than Roy Evans, as a distant example? Or is it just about the best players and avoiding too many injuries? Rafa did this clever thing a few times where he set the team up to look like they were playing one formation and then once the game started they’d rapidly switch to something else. A few times in the champions league we scored a couple of early goals and then switched to shut out mode for 150 minutes. So is that just a little bait and switch tactic; you make the other team think you’re playing 4-5-1 but suddenly play 3-5-2 and flood extra players into spaces they’re not expecting. That I can imagine is maybe hard to coach but then maybe not.",
      "There are obviously also glaring errors like Amorim playing a team that was built by ETH for a few years to play 4-5-1 suddenly being forced to play 3-5-2. Angeball is good viewing but basically not very wise it seems.",
      "Other weird things. When Brendan Rogers became Liverpool manager I remember an interview with a player and he spoke positively about how all the sessions involved a ball. Also Ajax do this from at all levels called the 1000 touch work out to make sure their players are all comfortable with the ball at their feet. Maybe on this latter point the really art of coaching is devising training routines that help players deal with real game situations? I recall Klopp coaching attacking routines for this specific reason; take the thought out and people can then be on autopilot and deliver more reliably.",

I was hoping to find some delightful emails on Liverpool’s latest malaise to revel in schadenfreude, and so I was initially very disappointed to find nothing there. This after I was also disappointed that there was no mention of it on MOTD last night either, all the pundits were talking about was how well Leeds had done.",
      "Then, I realised, this latest result meant something far more significant. Their lack of form and travails this season have been THE hot topic of debate so far as the decline was so relevant after they somehow managed to win the League last year. But their (lack of) form has now become deliciously irrelevant. Not worthy of comment. This is who they are. “This means more” ™ has become “This means meh” ™ to almost everyone.",

      "Would somebody mind telling me what way Spurs do play? Because I couldn’t tell you and I’m a season ticket holder at WHL.",
      "The basis of the article seems to be that Johnson is a very limited footballer who can only play one way. Okie dokes. That one way did result in a fair few goals last season. Remember goals? They’re nice and somewhat necessary if you’re going to win football matches. Johnson is 24. He has goals and assists under his belt and is coachable.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems to think he might be useful. Perhaps he’s watched the way Johnson combines with Solanke and thinks he could do the same with Mateta. But here’s the thing. Maybe Solanke won’t be injured forever. And maybe Kudus will carry on being the player who’s got 1 goal and 1 assist in his last 11 games. And maybe Solanke x Johnson could have been a thing again later in January when Kudus is even more knackered and looking a lot like second season at West Ham Kudus. But we’ll never know because by then the Mateta – Johnson show will be in full swing. And Spurs will be getting beat 3 – 0 by City with Tel replacing Odobert on 78 minutes.",

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Benjamin Sesko's issues in front of goal for Manchester United. Plus: John McGinn's touches in the box for Aston Villa, Jhon Arias' reinvention at Wolves and Max Kilman losing aerial duels for West Ham",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 09:12, UK",
      "Benjamin Sesko delayed his shot in the first half and saw it blocked. He badly mistimed a header from an offside position early in the second half, then side-footed the ball the wrong side of the post from close range. It was a difficult day for the striker at Leeds.",
      "Statistically, he finished the 1-1 draw at Elland Road as the player with the game's best chances but once again failed to find the net. It is perhaps the story of his Manchester United career so far, one that has not yet ignited since his big-money move from Leipzig.",
      "Having started each of the last four games, this is his joint-longest run in the side and Sesko can expect to make it five in a row at Burnley on Wednesday evening. But Ruben Amorim needs more from the 22-year-old forward in the absence of other key players.",
      "International commitments have robbed United of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in this busy period, but the fixture list was inviting for Sesko. Instead, they have won only one of the last four. Had they beaten Wolves at home and won at Leeds they would now be fourth.",
      "Sesko has had 12 shots in these matches without scoring. The other four men to have had this many shots in the Premier League during this period have each scored at least twice. In terms of non-penalty expected goals, of the top dozen he is the only one not to score.",
      "All of which suggests that Sesko is getting service. There were six attempts on goal against Wolves without seriously testing the goalkeeper. He ranks in the top 12 for non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "Of the top 20, only three players have underperformed in front of goal by a wider margin than the Manchester United man. Whether that poor return from the chances that he has had is an encouraging sign or a reason for concern is a matter of perspective.",
      "These expected goals numbers are in line with his two seasons in the Bundesliga. In that sense, United are getting what they bought, it is just that those shots have not been going in as often as they did in Leipzig, where his conversion was impressive. That can change.",
      "Perhaps the worry for United is that they hoped for more not less. An investment in potential, Sesko's size and speed meant that he was seen as someone on an upward trajectory who could build on hauls of 14 and 13 in those two seasons as a Bundesliga player.",
      "Instead, as with the admittedly older Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, the Premier League has exposed some limitations. Sesko has time on his side and the underlying numbers too. But if this winter was an opportunity for him to step up, it has not yet been seized.",
      "John McGinn is a beloved figure at Aston Villa and at 31 there are not many tricks for him still to be taught. Unai Emery trusts his captain. But that does not mean that the Villa manager cannot demand more. Those demands won the game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In truth, McGinn did not need to venture into the Forest box to score the points-sealing third goal, finishing from long distance when John Victor went walkabout. But he still had to make the run - just as he did for his first goal, that one coming from inside the penalty area.",
      "McGinn had five touches in the opposition box during the game. That is more than in any other Premier League appearance this season, beating his high of four registered against Brentford back in August. He had settled into a rhythm of staying a little deeper.",
      "What a response. McGinn had not scored twice in a game in the Premier League before, achieving the feat in an Aston Villa shirt for only the second time in all competitions - the other also coming against Forest back in the Championship almost seven years ago.",
      "Emery's reputation for improving players is well established and that ability to coax more from his squad has been a feature of Villa's success under him. McGinn, 311 games into his career with the club, still adding new elements to his game only underlines the point.",
      "Mateus Mane has been the star performer for Wolves of late, the catalyst for their improved performance levels as they picked up their first win of the Premier League season against West Ham. But the recall of his new midfield partner Jhon Arias has been key too.",
      "Arias was an unused substitute in the game prior to Rob Edwards' arrival but has featured in every game under him. He came in to start the draw at Manchester United and then scoring the opening goal - his first in a Wolves shirt - in the defeat of the Hammers at Molineux.",
      "His improved form has come in a new role. Having been signed as a winger, he struggled playing with his back to goal, unable to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. But injuries and suspensions forced Edwards to look for a new solution at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed centrally alongside Mane, with Joao Gomes providing protection behind, Arias has been able to find much more space when getting on the ball in deeper areas rather than being restricted to the flank. It has helped him to show more of what he can do.",
      "It has helped Wolves too. The Brazilian duo of Gomes and Andre have Premier League class but as a pair they are not attack-minded enough to threaten the opposition centrally. Neither has scored this season. Arias and Mane, as twin eights, both managed it in one half.",
      "Speaking to Edwards in the press conference after the game, he confessed to having had a sleepless night wondering whether to recall the available again Andre. He opted to stick with Arias and was rewarded. Now he is wondering if he has hit upon something.",
      "\"Potentially,\" acknowledged Edwards. \"I mean, his last two performances have been really good in that more of an eight role, in that deeper role. I think he covers the ground really well. And obviously, he has got a real calmness in possession with the ball.\"",
      "Few expect Arias to stay at Wolves long term and, unlike Mane, it may be that his name will remain synonymous with the club's failings this season. But this belated reinvention is a reminder of his quality. How Wolves will wish they had been able to unlock it sooner.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo said afterwards that he could not remember a worse day on a football pitch in his long career. Maximilian Kilman might well agree. The West Ham defender endured a miserable game on his return to Molineux, booed by his own team's supporters.",
      "The catalyst was the second Wolves goal. Kilman's clearance was an ugly one, contorting his body into a strange position in failing to deal with the ball into the box. It led to West Ham conceding a penalty from which there proved to be no way back for his team.",
      "But the dissatisfaction with Kilman runs deep. A £40m signing in the summer of 2024, his seven-year contract is now seen as emblematic of West Ham's flawed recruitment strategy. Now 28 years of age, the hope was that Kilman would be a dominant figure at the back.",
      "On Saturday, he was outmuscled by Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare. Kilman lost eight aerial duels to the Nigerian, the most that he has ever lost in a Premier League game for West Ham - although his three worst displays in this regard have all come this season.",
      "At his best, Kilman can be calm and competent in possession but he has never been the most demonstrative of defenders. A popular figure in a mid-table Wolves side, the expectations were rather different when he was a bargain buy from Maidenhead United.",
      "At West Ham, he has become a lightning rod for fan frustration, unable to convince with his body language, sparking accusations of timidity. If Kilman is ever to win over those supporters, he will need to win far more of his aerial duels than he did at Molineux.",

      "It is an approach that has largely worked in terms of stopping the opposition - Slot noted Fulham scored with their first chance on Sunday and Harrison Reed's screamer would not go down as a big chance. But has he sacrificed too much of Liverpool's attacking impetus?",
      "They were lacking in cutting edge in the first half at Fulham on the back of the 0-0 at home to Leeds. But Slot believes the issue of chance creation is a separate one.",
      "\"I'd like to create five times as much chances as we do now,\" he said. \"But I do know in the period of time when we were playing more open, I don't think we created more chances but we conceded much more.\"",

      "At a difficult ground, Manchester United needed him to step up on Sunday. They were once again heavily depleted in attack, still without the injured Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount as well as AFCON absentees Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "For much of the game, Cunha had to make things happen on his own, with Benjamin Sesko struggling again. But Zirkzee's introduction gave him a better foil and he was energetic throughout, relishing the physical battle and giving his team an outlet.",

      "O'Reilly has found himself learning on the job this season. A polished midfielder by trade but a left-back by necessity. City can usually protect that kind of compromise with structure and possession. This time, they could not in a decisive moment. O'Reilly got isolated, squared up and beaten by Gusto. That is not an indictment of the player, it is a reminder of how much full-back defending is an art.",
      "Guardiola has always believed that collective organisation can mask individual weaknesses. Most of the time, he is right. But the Premier League is such an unforgiving beast and opposition teams have noticed where City are vulnerable. Chelsea took full advantage.Lewis Jones",
      "You could have easily been lured into thinking this would be the perfect time to play Chelsea. No manager, form on the blink, having dropped 15 points from winning positions so far this season. But the reality at the Eithad was far from what pre-game narratives supposed.",
      "This was not a contest flush with high quality chances but Chelsea made it as difficult as they could before getting the break of luck their determined display deserved. It was a performance stand-in coach Calum McFarlane could be proud of.",
      "Had Enzo Maresca - dismissed three days prior - still been in the hotseat, no doubt he would have echoed similar sentiment post match. McFarlane admitted to being surprised by City's structure in the first half but found the answers in the second, with the introduction of Andrey Santos at half-time adding stability, and latterly Liam Delap for physicality up top. The hustle worked.",
      "Chelsea ended the game with nearly twice the xG value of their hosts and generated three big chances, limiting City to zero of their own. Pep Guardiola said afterwards that none of that surprised him as he considers Maresca to be one of the \"best build-up coaches\" in England. Perhaps that's why he's been linked with eventually succeeding Guardiola at City.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has said he is a manager and not a head coach after being questioned on his ability to manage the club; Amorim hinted at frustrations regarding the club's transfer plans prior to the 1-1 draw with Leeds United",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 07:27, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has sensationally claimed that he joined Manchester United to be their manager, not their head coach, and suggested that he will leave the club at the end of his contract.",
      "Asked whether he still feels he has the backing of the club's board during his press conference following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim was keen to clarify his role at the club having recently hinted at friction behind the scenes over transfers and tactics.",
      "The former Sporting boss was unveiled as head coach when he was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract which is due to expire in June 2027, but, in an apparent message to the hierarchy, he has said he sees himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said in an explosive finish to his press conference at Elland Road.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United and it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change.",
      "\"That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt assurances from the club had not been fulfilled, Amorim added: \"I just want to say I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that.",
      "\"That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "\"If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach.",
      "\"Every department - the scouting department, the sport director - needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.\"",
      "Amorim's comments follow a suggestion on Christmas Eve that he has not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market to play with his preferred tactical system.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen. So, maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three against Wolves.",
      "He then gave an uncharacteristically downbeat press conference before the Leeds game on Friday which featured more cryptic comments.",
      "\"There was a clear shift in Amorim's mood at his Friday press conference and it didn't improve this afternoon. He seemed quite similar and made it clear repeatedly that he is the Manchester United manager, and that that is what he came to do.",
      "\"He referenced Conte, Tuchel and Mourinho. That can be interpreted as him saying he doesn't have the full autonomy of big-name managers, or it can be interpreted as him saying his decisions are being questioned by those higher up at the club.",
      "\"One thing that cannot be argued, though, is that there has been a clear shift in Amorim's mood in the last week or so. We felt that on Friday at his news conference ahead of this game, and it hasn't improved whatsoever after the 1-1 draw.\"",

      "Match report as Manchester United are held to a 1-1 draw by Leeds; Brenden Aaronson scored the opener for Leeds but Matheus Cunha levelled shortly afterwards; Ruben Amorim's side have only one win from last five games; Leeds now unbeaten in seven",
      "Sunday 4 January 2026 16:22, UK",
      "Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw at Elland Road as bitter rivals Leeds extended their unbeaten run to seven games.",
      "Ruben Amorin's side, held by the same scoreline against Wolves on Tuesday, had to come from behind on this occasion after Brenden Aaronson put Leeds ahead when he outpaced Ayden Heaven to beat Senne Lammens in the second half.",
      "The visitors hit back quickly, however, with Matheus Cunha finishing smartly on the angle just 174 seconds after the opening goal, having been played through by substitute Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "In an apparent message to the Man Utd hierarchy, Ruben Amorim insisted he sees himself as a manager rather than a head coach after the game.",
      "The equaliser set up a frantic finale which featured chances for both sides. Cunha went closest for Manchester United when he struck the outside of the post from the edge of the box, while Benjamin Sesko fired wastefully wide from Zirkzee's cut-back.",
      "Leeds: Perri (7), Justin (7), Bornauw (7), Bijol (7), Struijk (7), Gudmundsson (7), Gruev (6), Stach (7), Aaronson (8), Okafor (6), Calvert-Lewin (6)\n\n\nSubs: Nmecha (6), Tanaka (6), Gnonto (6), Piroe (n/a)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (7), Heaven (7), Martinez (7), Dalot (6), Ugarte (6), Casemiro (7), Shaw (7), Dorgu (7), Cunha (8), Sesko (5)\n\n\nSubs: Zirkzee (7)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Matheus Cunha",
      "Joel Piroe then came close to a winner at the other end when he fired narrowly over with his first touch after coming off the bench.",
      "Leeds also struck the post from Dominic Calvert-Lewin's glancing header in the first half, while Noah Okafor had an overhead kick superbly saved at full stretch by Lammens.",
      "Amorim's side had other scoring opportunities too, the best of which saw Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri make a fine reflex stop from Leny Yoro's close-range header.",
      "Manchester United showed some improvement from the Wolves draw, after which they were booed off at Old Trafford, but the result leaves them with one win from their last five Premier League games.",
      "For Leeds, impressive again having drawn with Liverpool on New Year's Day, it is another step towards safety, a seventh game without loss which puts them eight points clear of the drop zone.",
      "\"It was not our best game, it was a bit scruffy at times and you could feel that a few key players were out and we were a bit tired.",
      "\"We found a way to force an opener and would've taken all three points so I'm a bit disappointed, but if I calm down it's probably a fair result.",
      "\"It was important to play aggressively but not lose our nerves and find a good balance. It wasn't our best game but it was another valuable point.\"",
      "In an explosive end to his post-match press conference, Ruben Amorim insisted he sees himself as a manager rather than a head coach.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United,\" he said. \"That is clear.",

      "\"I think we had more control in this game than we showed against Wolves. That is important when you prepare for the next week as you can learn from the mistakes you made in the last game.",
      "\"We controlled Leeds quite well. A team that is quite strong on set-pieces and second balls and really quick up front. We had our opportunities to win the game, of course. We are losing games in the details. For Leeds' goal, we are controlling the game and one kick in transition [undoes us].",
      "\"We managed to get back into the game. Last year, it would be completely different. This year we are in control of the games more often than last year. We are little bit frustrated not to win.\"",
      "Cunha performed poorly in the draw with his former club Wolves but this was much more like it from the 26-year-old. He looked determined to give a better account of himself right from the start and finished the game as its outstanding player.",
      "His goal, slotted past Perri after being played in by Zirkzee, means he has scored or assisted in four of his last six appearances. He was inches away from adding a winner when his curling shot bounced off the outside of the post in the closing stages.",
      "At a difficult ground, Manchester United needed him to step up. They were once again heavily depleted in attack, still without the injured Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount as well as AFCON absentees Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "For much of the game, Cunha had to make things happen on his own, with Sesko struggling again. But Zirkzee's introduction gave him a better foil and he was energetic throughout, relishing the physical battle and giving his team an outlet.",
      "\"We tried to do everything to win,\" he said after the game. That was particularly true of man-of-the-match Cunha himself.",

We know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future.\"",

      "\"There's the process. There's an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of Champions League, but we are also near eight teams behind us. So let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Prodded further as to whether players had come to him to ask to leave the club this window, Amorim added: \"No. None of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask for anything.\"",
      "\"It's an ambition [of mine] to be the best midfielder in the world. I just want to work hard, to take some advice, to take something from the midfielders. Not just in the Premier League, because I learned a lot from here,\" he said.",

      "\"In LaLiga, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets. I try to learn every day. I'm watching them on YouTube.\"",
      "Baleba took his love for the game to France from Douala, Cameroon, with Lille beckoning. After rising through the ranks in France, a move to Brighton and the Premier League soon followed. He made the move to the Amex in August 2023 but it was his performances in the 2024/25 season that made everyone take note.",
      "Under the guidance of Fabian Hurzeler, Baleba emerged as one of the league's finest midfield prospects. But after a whirlwind summer, it's been a slower start to this campaign. The spotlight was always an ambition for Baleba but he didn't expect the speed at which his reputation would rise.",
      "\"When I see my name everywhere, I'm happy,\" he says. \"When I was a kid, it was a wish for my dad and my mum. It's a wish for me.",
