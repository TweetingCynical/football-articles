      "Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood has offered a scathing assessment of three of Ruben Amorim's Manchester United stars. Sherwood does not rate defenders Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt, and has not been impressed with Benjamin Sesko's efforts so far.",
      "Yoro, 20, and De Ligt, 26, arrived at Old Trafford in 2024 but have failed to impress the ex-Blackburn midfielder. The French defender arrived from Lille as United beat competition from Real Madrid for his signature, while De Ligt joined from Bayern Munich, having already featured for Juventus and Ajax.",
      "Sherwood has acknowledged that players from Europe need time to settle in the Premier League, but is not convinced that it will lead to a positive result for the Red Devils.",
      "Sesko fared no better in Sherwood's mind. The young striker has scored just two goals in 14 appearances for United, and the former Aston Villa boss reckons if he'd come through the club's academy, he would not have been offered further chances by Amorim.",
      "Sherwood told BetWright : “I don’t see it with Leny Yoro at the moment, to be honest. I always feel that players need time to settle into the Premier League, especially if you’re a young player who’s come from Europe, but I don’t see it with him.",
      "“Having said that, I also don’t see it with Matthijs de Ligt either – I don’t think he’s the answer for Manchester United.",
      "“You could say the same about a lot of Manchester United’s players, and I think it demonstrates how big of a drop off there is between Arsenal and Manchester City ’s squad and the rest of the league.",
      "“I’m also not sold by Benjamin Sesko. He hasn’t had a huge amount of chances, but I’d have at least expected to see something by now. I don’t see anything with him at the moment.",
      "“If he was an academy player at Manchester United coming through the ranks and he performed the way he has, you’d never seen him again and he’d never get another opportunity.",
      "“I hope for Man United’s sake that he improves, but at the moment, I don’t see it with him.”",
      "Sesko returned to United's starting line-up in defeat to Aston Villa after a period out with a knee injury. The striker could next feature against Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Victory then would see United go level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea. Amorim's side are currently seventh in the Premier League standings.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim does not expect Bruno Fernandes or Kobbie Mainoo to be available for the Boxing Day meeting with Newcastle. While not giving precise return dates, he said he expected Mainoo to return sooner.",
      "Fernandes picked up an injury during the first half of United's defeat at Aston Villa over the weekend. He battled through until half-time but didn't return to the pitch for the second half as a Morgan Rogers double was enough to hand United's opponents all three points.",
      "Mainoo was injured in training on the eve of the Villa game but is closing in on a return. \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster for Bruno,\" Amorim said.",
      "United take on Manchester City in the derby on January 17, and it remains to be seen whether their skipper is back in time for that game. \"I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see,\" Amorim said when asked about Fernandes' return date.",
      "Since joining United from Sporting CP in January 2020, Fernandes has been a near-permanent fixture in the first team. The 31-year-old has missed just nine of United's 221 league games over that period, and had played the full 90 in the bulk of this season's games before injury struck at Villa Park.",
      "Amorim is already without Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad, with all three away at the Africa Cup of Nations. The loss of Fernandes is an additional blow, and the head coach will need to find a way to make up for the absence of a player who has contributed five goals and seven assists this term.",
      "United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day, and follow that with another home game four days later against Wolves. They have two further league games before the Manchester Derby on January 17 - away at Leeds and Burnley - and will host Brighton in the FA Cup on January 11.",
      "United will at least be able to call upon Casemiro on Boxing Day. The Brazilian sat out the Villa game through suspension, but it was just a one-game ban for the accumulation of yellow cards.",
      "Manuel Ugarte could continue after being given a rare start at Villa Park. Lisandro Martinez is another option, with the centre-back used in a midfield role after coming off the bench, while young midfielder Jack Fletcher will be pushing for more minutes in the middle after making his Premier League bow over the weekend.",
      "\"We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing,\" Amorim said. \"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.\"",
      "When discussing Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, who both missed Sunday's game through injury, he added: \"We are still working with them. They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.\"",

      "Manchester United are staring down a crucial transfer window as the heat intensifies on Ruben Amorim to sort out their defensive frailties. Former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has laid bare his concerns, suggesting the current back line doesn't possess the winning mentality needed to keep goals out on a regular basis.",
      "The ex-England and Wrexham shot-stopper, who spent five years at Old Trafford between 2005 and 2010, has cast doubt over whether any of the club's curren defenders would strengthen their main Premier League competitors. The scrutiny follows Amorim's side suffering a 2-1 loss at Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, he said: \"I think Roy Keane got it bang on about the dedication to really stop goals going in. They don't want to get exposed by somebody doing them.",
      "\"They don't want a meme to appear of them getting absolutely 'megged, twisted or turned, so they stand off. They still seem like they're missing in four or five positions where they need somebody that's w‎orld class in that position.\"",
      "He added: \"Look at the back line of Man United. Would any defender from that team get into any of the big boys like Liverpool, Arsenal or Man City? They're not going to improve any of those teams. They're good players, but they're not going to stop goals like this, because they're not willing to really do the dirty stuff.\"",
      "Sunday's loss proved costly for United, who desperately needed the three points against Villa to stay in touch with their top-four competitors. The outcome left Amorim's squad sitting seventh in the Premier League standings, now trailing Sunderland by a point and both Liverpool and Chelsea by three.",
      "The match also represented the sixth occasion in eight league fixtures that United have failed to secure maximum points. From the start of November, their record shows four draws, two defeats and two victories as their momentum has ground to a halt. Keane particularly targeted Diogo Dalot for criticism following the Villa loss.",
      "He said: \"You can have all the talent in the world, but we mention it time and time again, you've got to roll your sleeves up. When the game gets a bit tired, or those moments, you go, 'I'm going to do my bit for the team.'",
      "\"There's too many players like Dalot, who just don't do enough. I won't use the word 'cheating' but they're not doing enough.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's performance overall, Keane said: \"I wouldn't say they were unlucky - they gave up two goals. They've conceded six goals in the last two games, and that's not good enough.",
      "\"We praise them going forward, and they are more of a goal threat, but with the amount of chances and goals they're giving up, you can't make progress. United can dig deep, they showed that again today, but they need to be more intense when they're defending, they need more pride there.\"",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Ravel Morrison has criticised Ruben Amorim's treatment of Kobbie Mainoo, having consistently snubbed him from the starting XI. The academy graduate has been limited to reduced game time this season, losing his place in the team.",
      "The 20‑year‑old broke through from the academy in the 2023/24 season but is yet to start a Premier League game for United this campaign. He has played just 212 minutes as a substitute and even came close to leaving Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "United are expecting approaches for the youngster in the New Year, though only an 'exceptional offer' will force the club to consider selling. Meanwhile, Morrison, who also came through the academy, struggled to nail down a regular spot despite being tipped for greatness at the club.",
      "With Mainoo experiencing something similar, Morrison has questioned Amorim's treatment of the midfielder.",
      "Speaking on the Filthy Fellas podcast, he said: \"They're taking the p***. He's a top player isn't he? I know you can't really say it's bad just coming on for a minute.",
      "\"But I don't know if they brought him on just to take the p*** just for a minute because he should really be playing a lot more than that.",
      "\"He needs a run of games because you've seen the level he can play at. Do you know what I mean? But he does need a run of games.\"",
      "The 32-year-old then went on to aim a cheeky dig at the Portuguese head coach, adding: \"You know what? I don't know what system United play. I only watch Arsenal isn't it?\"",
      "After making only three senior appearances for United, Morrison went on to feature for Birmingham, QPR, Cardiff and Lazio.",

I remember all the history of Manchester United and [there is] nobody this didn't fall [to], so let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.",

      "The Old Trafford waterfall could soon be a thing of the past, with Manchester United's owners ready to deal with the lingering problem. Long time owners the Glazer family have appeared to make the issue a low priority, but it has been claimed that things will now change with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in charge.",
      "Not that Ratcliffe himself has acted immediately. The British billionaire's investment was announced midway through the 2023/24 season, and a new stadium was discussed as a target for the club before more recent conversations around redeveloping the current site",
      "For now UEFA rules could force the owner to act, according to the Sun. Work on improving the Old Trafford drainage system is one of a number of proposed changes as United chase a return to European competition, with a pitch renovation and improvement to both dugouts also on the cards.",
      "In May 2024, it had emerged that United were delaying direct work on the roof until after a decision had been made on the future of Old Trafford. Heavy rain and stormy conditions during a match against Arsenal earlier that month had left areas flooded, with the club indicating at the time that the stadium's siphonic roof drainage system overflowed, causing the waterfall-like conditions.",
      "It wasn't the first time the club had dealt with such a scenario at their famous stadium. Ahead of a Manchester derby in 2019, water was seen pouring from the roof onto the seats after a thunderstorm in the vicinity.",
      "Earlier in the same year, Ratcliffe spoke about the argument for refurbishing United's home. “The two most talked-about issues at Manchester United are number one, the football, the performance on the pitch and the second one is the stadium,\" he said. \"What we can see so far is a really good case to refurbish Old Trafford, probably about £1billion in cost.\"",
      "One of United's potential routes into Europe has gone thanks to a shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town. They could still secure a European spot through their league position, though, while they will kick off their FA Cup campaign in January with the goal of reclaiming the title they won in 2024.",
      "Amorim and his players missed the chance to spend Christmas Day in the top five after losing to Aston Villa on Sunday. They are still well-positioned in seventh, though, just three points shy of the Champions League spots.",

      "Anyone with a deal running out on June 30 will be free to speak to overseas clubs next month and even sign a pre-contract agreement. That would mean they move on a free in the summer, while remaining free to play for their current club until then.",
      "This time last year, Liverpool stars Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah were all in that position, with Salah and Van Dijk eventually signing new deals and Alexander-Arnold moving to Real Madrid. This time around, Manchester United are at risk of losing several stars themselves.",
      "Not all expiring contracts are created equal, of course. Tom Heaton has been tipped to retire at the end of the current campaign, while Tyrell Malacia is unlikely to be a significant loss after barely featuring over the last two-and-a-half years.",
      "There was a time when the other two players on the list also wouldn't have felt like huge losses. However, both Harry Maguire and Casemiro have rebuilt their United careers under Ruben Amorim to a point that they will be missed if and when they leave.",
      "United hold an option for an extra year on Casemiro's deal after he signed an initial four-year contract in 2022. They exercised a similar option with Maguire, whose own deal had been due to expire in June 2025 before the option was triggered.",
      "Despite this, questions remain over both men. Casemiro is one of the Premier League's highest earners and there's a sense from some that he hasn't done enough to justify another year on high wages despite his resurgence, while Maguire has spoken about the uncertainty around his own future.",
      "\"I’m in my last year now, so this could be the last time I played at Anfield for this club,\" the England international said after scoring United's winner away to Liverpool. \"It’s really important that I’ve come here and ticked that one off.\"",
      "The Mail reported in October that Maguire's representatives had been in regular contact with United but without a formal offer arriving. The 32-year-old, who has been sidelined through injury of late, could yet agree to a wage cut if offered a new contract of a suitable length.",
      "Casemiro could also still stay at Old Trafford, despite reports of interest from Saudi Arabia and the United States. Head coach Ruben Amorim has been impressed by the Brazilian's reaction to falling out of favour last season, speaking highly of the example set this term.",
      "\"I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone,\" Amorim said in October. \"In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.\"",

      "The England attacker, 28, moved to Spain in the summer after falling out of favour at Old Trafford. And Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has been a huge hit at the Nou Camp playing under Hansi Flick, contributing seven goals and 11 assists in all competitions for Barca.",
      "It was well documented that Barcelona was Rashford's dream move when speculation over his future was rife back in the summer. And off the back of his fine start to life in La Liga, Rashford has confirmed that he still only has eyes for a permanent switch.",
      "Speaking to Sport in an interview focused on his charity work after visiting schools in Barcelona, Rashford said: “I’m settling in really well at the club and in the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt very welcomed. For me, the reason I’m here is to help the team win trophies; last season was fantastic, but life moves very fast, things change, and the goal is to repeat those successes. I’m totally focused on that. Everything has been fantastic with the staff and my teammates; I have no complaints.”",
      "He continued: “Of course, what I want is to stay at Barca. It’s the ultimate goal, but it’s not the reason I’m training hard and giving my all. The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.”",
      "An option for Barcelona to sign Rashford permanently for £26million was included in the deal which took the Manchester United academy graduate to Spain back in July.",
      "The switch was seen as an opportunity for Rashford to make a fresh start after being scrutinised during his final days at Old Trafford.",

I can’t be in a place where there aren’t high expectations; for me, it’s harder to stay motivated and give my best at a club where the demands aren’t at their peak.",

      "Manchester United are gearing up for an exciting January transfer window as Ruben Amorim looks to make some changes to his squad. United have had a mixed first half of the season, currently sitting seventh in the table and three points off the Champions League places.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on the weekend summed up their season-long frailties. And if losing three players to the Africa Cup of Nations wasn't a major blow already, Amorim has now been left without his captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He pulled up with a hamstring injury in the first half of the Villa defeat. United were expected to address their issues in midfield even before reports emerged claiming Fernandes could be out for at least a month.",
      "United are unlikely to land Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window. The club hierarchy are keen to overhaul the midfield in the coming windows after using last summer to splurge on forward signings.",
      "Anderson, who has impressed in recent months on his way to becoming an England starter, is one player who has caught United's eye. But The Athletic's David Ornstein told NBC Sports this week that United will not pull off the transfer in the coming weeks.",
      "That’s because Forest do not want to let the player, who is under contract until 2029, leave while he is still not agitating for a move. The situation could change in the summer if United come in with a bid in the region of £80-£100million, once they free up some salary space.",
      "United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have called on the club to go back to their old ways by \"bullying\" Premier League teams and buying their best players. Speaking about potential midfield signings, Butt told The Good The Bad and The Football podcast that Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers should be brought to Old Trafford, despite his side sitting comfortably ahead of United in the table after he scored a brace against them.",
      "Butt said: “Realistic one if Man United go back to bullying teams and buying their best players. I don’t mean Arsenal or City but those next ones down which we always used to do, they used to go to Tottenham and get their best player, Morgan Rogers go and get him. Play him wherever, he’s better than what we’ve got at the moment.”",
      "Scholes chimed in: “Nicky’s got a good point. We got Dwight Yorke, the best player from Aston Villa, Teddy Sherringham, Robin van Persie from Arsenal. We used to go and get their best players. I’m not sure we’re in that position at the minute.”",
      "United and neighbours City have reportedly entered talks with Antoine Semenyo’s camp over a potential January move for the player. Both Manchester clubs, as well as Liverpool and Chelsea, are interested in signing the in-form Bournemouth sensation, who has taken the league by storm.",
      "Semenyo has a £65m release clause in his contract which expires on January 10, meaning there is a race between England’s top clubs to secure his signature in the next two weeks. It was reported on Tuesday afternoon that United, City and Chelsea had made contact with Semenyo to discuss conditions of a potential deal.",
      "However, The Athletic claim he prefers a move to the Etihad. It therefore appears that neither Anderson nor Semenyo will be Old Trafford-bound in January.",

      "Yet it seems that might have been a slip of the tongue, as Semenyo, who has been spotted at the Emirates Stadium, once explicitly stated that he supports Arsenal. In a 2024 interview with The Athletic, he said: \"I am an Arsenal fan.",

The Portugal international has been absent for just two fixtures due to injury since his arrival at Old Trafford in 2020 and it was reported on Tuesday he could miss the next six matches.",
      "United face a hectic schedule over the festive period with four games in 12 days. United host Newcastle on Boxing Day before welcoming Wolves to Old Trafford four days later. Trips to Leeds United and Burnley then follow in 2026.",

United are also without Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt through injury, but Shearer has highlighted why Fernandes' absence in particular will prove damaging for the team.",
      "\"Losing Bruno Fernandes at any time would be bad but losing him when you're already missing three players in Mazraoui, Diallo, and Mbeumo, will hurt Man United,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"He's been the one constant through all their troubles, the one pulling them through games at times.",

      "Chelsea have emerged as contenders to sign Antoine Semenyo by launching a late bid to sign the Bournemouth star. Semenyo, 25, is wanted by a cluster of Premier League clubs including Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "The London-born Ghana international is available for £65million due to a release clause which activates on New Year's Day. The clause will only be active until the second week of January, though, giving Bournemouth ample time to sign a replacement.",
      "A departure next month looks increasingly likely, although Chelsea weren't among the favourites to sign him - until now. Several outlets are reporting that the Blues entered the race on Monday evening after Semenyo and his representatives had spent the day weighing up their options.",
      "The Mail report that Semenyo has an affiliation with Chelsea, having been born in West London. The 25-year-old came through the ranks of Bristol City before joining Bournemouth for £10m two years ago.",
      "Semenyo's release clause, which is specified as £60m plus £5m in add-ons, will be reduced in the summer transfer window, but interested clubs are increasingly wary that by then it could be too late. The forward has scored eight goals and provided three assists in 17 games for Bournemouth this season.",
      "The Cherries are reluctant to lose Semenyo, especially having lost four key players over the summer, but they're ultimately powerless if a suitor activates his clause. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola commented: \"Semenyo right now is with us. He trained today with us",

Even when not scoring, he is still valuable for us. At the end, we don’t just demand numbers. It is no secret he is a massive player for us.\"",

      "Joleon Lescott admits he's not shocked by the impressive form Marcus Rashford is showing at Barcelona. The Manchester United loanee made the switch to Spain this summer.",
      "After falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim, Rashford initially joined Aston Villa on a temporary basis in January before securing another loan move to Barcelona in July.",
      "Since arriving at the Catalan club, Rashford has been given substantial playing time. Hansi Flick has put his faith in the 28-year-old on the left wing whilst Raphinha has been sidelined and he's also been used as a striker. Rashford has netted seven goals and contributed 11 assists across all competitions this season.",
      "Whilst his opportunities on the pitch might diminish now that Brazilian star Raphinha has returned from injury, Rashford has demonstrated his worth as a key part of Flick's squad. However, Lescott, who previously worked alongside Rashford with England, isn't taken aback by the United forward's displays.",
      "\"I'm not surprised by what he's doing over there,\" Lescott said, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"I believe Marcus Rashford makes a good team better. I don't think he makes ok teams better.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"Because the emphasis on him at Man United was that he had to do everything. I don't think he had that in his game. Whereas I think if he's in a good team and you want him to do certain things, he can do them. Then that team will be a lot better with him.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester City defender Lescott even confessed that when rumours emerged about Rashford's potential departure from United, he was eager for his former club to snap up the England international.",
      "\"When there was speculation, and it wasn't a lot, about him maybe coming to Manchester City, I would've wanted to sign him that day. I would've signed him,\" Lescott revealed.",
      "\"I doubt he would've gone, but he definitely would've made City better. You look at what he's doing at Barcelona. They have Raphinha. And Raphinha was sensational last year and they haven't got any worse when Rashford is in there. He's obviously a top top player.\"",
      "Rashford was relegated to the substitutes' bench during Barcelona's most recent victory at Villarreal, but manager Flick has already made clear precisely what the 28-year-old brings to the side.",
      "\"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected. The last time I checked with him he said, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions. The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important,'\" Flick explained.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I am so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",

      "Antonio Conte had a dig at Manchester United after two ex-Old Trafford stars helped Napoli emulate Diego Maradona and win the Italian Supercoppa. The former Chelsea and Spurs boss led the southern giant to the Scudetto in his first season in 2024/25 with Romelu Lukuku top scorer.",
      "And now Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund - who was loaned after the Belgian suffered a thigh injury in pre-season - have starred in the 2-0 win over Bologna in Saudi Arabia. The Scotland star was named Serie A player of the year after netting 13 goals from midfield after his £25.7million sale by United in August 2024.",
      "And Hojlund, who cost the Old Trafford club £72m, has now scored seven times back in Italy as Napoli won the Scudetto and the Supercoppa in the same year for the first time since 1990 with Maradona. The Dane posted a picture of himself with the trophy on social media with the caption: \"What a great decision looks like.\"",
      "And Conte said: “Everyone used to say Rasmus didn’t play in Manchester, neither did McTominay, so why? Ask yourselves some questions there. The staff and I had work to do, there is a reason we are here, after all.”",
      "Ex-Premier League stars Kevin De Bruyne, Andre Frank Zambo Anguissa and Billy Gilmour were all out injured as Brazilian David Neres scored both goals in Saudi Arabia. And Conte added: “The first goal was a moment of magic from an individual, but the other chances were all prepared by analysing how to cause problems for Bologna.",
      "“Our job as a coach is to increase the knowledge of a player and make him stronger. I feel like everyone I worked with emerged improved, in tactical understanding and movements, but also in mentality.”",
      "Conte, who won the Premier League and FA Cup at Chelsea, lifted his 10th major trophy - and then admitted he was motivated by his past failures. “I can tell you that nobody bothers looking up the beaten finalists, because I’ve lost many as a player and a coach and they made me more mean,” said the former Italy head coach.",
      "“Nobody remembers I was runner-up in the World Cup, European Championship finalist, or lost three Champions League Finals. They remember that as a player I won one Champions League and one Intercontinental Cup.",
      "“When you lose a final, it increases your determination, and you try not to experience those ugly moments again. They hurt because you know that it was a good journey, but you’ve got to put that cherry on top of the cake.”",
      "President Aurelio de Laurentiis said: “Not since the Maradona era have we won two trophies in a year. Conte is a master.”",
      "This latest triumph comes only six weeks after Napoli lost 2-0 at Bologna in Serie A and Conte launched a stinging attack on his player before missing training. “We must do something,” he said. “I don’t want to accompany a dead man”.",
      "But they go into 2026 sitting third in Serie A, although they are down in 23rd in the Champions League.",
      "Former England manager Fabio Capello told Gazzetta dello Sport: “Let’s not joke. What crisis? Napoli has excellent players and a winning coach in Conte, now Lukaku and other injured players are back.",
      "“The Supercoppa win will be very important for the players’ mentality. A psychological turning point that will also boost them in the league.”",

      "A year has flown by since Marcus Rashford sent shockwaves through the football world by announcing he was ready to leave Manchester United. At the time, it seemed inconceivable that the forward, who had risen through United's youth ranks to become his boyhood club's star player, would ever depart Old Trafford, especially under such bitter circumstances while still at his physical peak.",
      "The past 12 months have been a rollercoaster for the 28-year-old, who found himself frozen out by Ruben Amorim at United, endured a mixed loan stint at Aston Villa, and is now flourishing in Spain with Barcelona.",
      "The England star grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons a year ago when he was dropped from the United squad that defeated Manchester City due to his alleged poor attitude during training sessions. This came after 18 months of underwhelming performances from a player who had previously been his team's driving force.",
      "Amorim's public criticism of the striker seemed to be the breaking point for Rashford, prompting him to take the drastic decision to end his United ordeal - through a bombshell interview with journalist Henry Winter where he announced his willingness to embrace a \"new challenge.\"",
      "During the interview, he admitted for the first time that he was open to leaving the club. He said: \"For me, personally, I think I'm ready for a new challenge and the next steps.",
      "\"When I leave it's going to be 'no hard feelings'. You're not going to have any negative comments from me about Manchester United. That's me as a person.",
      "\"If I know that a situation is already bad I'm not going to make it worse. I've seen how other players have left in the past and I don't want to be that person. When I leave I'll make a statement and it will be from me.\"",
      "Rashford also responded to Amorim's decision to drop him by stating: \"It's disheartening to be left out of a derby but it's happened, we won the game so let's move on.",
      "\"It's disappointing but I'm also someone as I've got older I can deal with setbacks. What am I going to do about it? Sit there and cry about it. Or do my best the next time I'm available.\"",
      "By that point, it seemed all bridges between Rashford and Amorim had been burnt, with the forward excluded from every matchday squad for the remainder of the month until December 30, 2024, when he remained on the bench as an unused substitute against Newcastle.",
      "Having not played a single minute since December 12, Amorim, in late January, publicly addressed Rashford’s need to change aspects of his game if he had any hope of returning to the squad, saying he would rather pick his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach ahead of a \"player who doesn’t give maximum effort in training\".",
      "Rashford left United for the first time at the end of the January transfer window, securing a loan move to Aston Villa until the end of the season. His stint at Villa Park allowed him to rebuild his reputation and regain visibility after his exile, especially in the Champions League against PSG.",
      "He netted four goals and provided six assists in 940 minutes of play but his loan spell ended on a sour note due to a hamstring injury, after which he returned to Carrington. There, he was part of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad', who were sidelined from first-team training to encourage them to seek transfers.",
      "After biding his time for the right opportunity, Rashford secured his dream move to Barcelona in July, joining the La Liga champions on loan until the summer of 2026. In the five months since, Rashford has come close to recapturing his best form, contributing 11 assists and seven goals for the Catalans in 24 appearances.",
      "The Englishman has made it clear he doesn't envision a return to United, expressing his wish to sign for Barcelona once his loan ends. For now, it remains uncertain whether Barcelona will activate their reported £26million option-to-buy clause, though the unlikelihood of any reconciliation with Amorim suggests Rashford will permanently leave United regardless.",

The January transfer window is fast approaching, and with it has seen increased speculation about the business that Premier League clubs may conduct.",
      "United are reportedly expected to have a busy transfer window in the New Year, with the midfield widely talked about as an area of the squad in need of investment. Brighton's Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, with the Seagulls reportedly placing a valuation of more than £100million on the midfielder.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace are two other players who have been linked with United over the last few months. The Sun have reported that United are prepared to sign two midfielders ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "It remains to be seen, though, if those plans will involve looking to bring in midfield reinforcements in the January window. A separate report from The Times has also reported that, with the recent injury to Bruno Fernandes, it's now unlikely that Mainoo will leave United in the January window.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a move away from United over the last few months, with the 20-year-old apparently looking for more game time after spending much of this season on the bench. Ruben Amorim has yet to hand Mainoo a start for United this season in the Premier League, but has given the England international 11 appearances as a substitute in the top flight.",
      "United suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, where Mainoo was not available for the match due to a calf injury. Amorim stated after the defeat to Villa that he expects Fernandes to be unavailable for United for their next run of fixtures after the Red Devils captain suffered a hamstring injury over the weekend.",
      "“It’s a soft tissue, I think he’s [Fernandes] going to lose some games, I don’t know for sure. Let’s see,\" Amorim said.",

The Scotland international featured for the entire 90 minutes as Antonio Conte's Italian champions earned a well-deserved 2-0 victory over Bologna in the Supercoppa Italiana.",
      "Napoli's Brazilian winger David Neres stole the headlines, netting both goals either side of the break. Yet, McTominay's display was befitting of the Serie A Footballer of the Year award he claimed for last season following his dominant league performances, having been central to several of Napoli's brightest moments once again.",
      "The 29-year-old threaded a sublime pass to Eljif Elmas in the opening stages which sent the Macedonian clean through, though he was denied an assist as his team-mate fired wide of the target.",
      "He came close to finding the net himself just before the break to extend Napoli's advantage but was thwarted by opposing keeper Federico Ravaglia. McTominay continued to dominate the midfield through his commanding presence and physical prowess, while proving instrumental in the team's attacking phases.",
      "He was again denied in the 77th minute following an acrobatic effort at the far post, having played a crucial role in Neres’ second goal minutes prior after pressing Bologna’s goalkeeper.",
      "Unsurprisingly, he received plenty of praise in the Italian press, with Corriere della Sera giving him a 7/10 match rating and referring to his \"dynamism\".",
      "Corriere dello Sport also awarded him a 7/10, noting that he was \"less flashy than usual in the first half but no less present.\" They highlighted how despite Tomasso Pobega's attempts to contain him, the Scottish international easily won their duel in the first half and upped his game after half-time.",
      "La Repubblica gave him a match rating of 6.5, framing his performance as a Scottish showdown with fellow countryman Lewis Ferguson in midfield - a battle they believe McTominay came out on top of.",
      "Eurosport Italy lauded McTominay, describing his performance alongside Rasmus Hojlund's as \"excellent\". Football Italia and Sky Sport Italy also deemed his display worthy of a 7.",
      "Il Giornale were slightly less generous, giving him a 6.5, but agreed that he continued to provide a constant threat, writing: “McTominay wasn’t as brilliant as in other matches but still always finds ways to be dangerous.”",
      "It appears the former United man’s form is showing no signs of letting up under the tutelage of Conte, having scored five goals and provided three assists this season across all competitions.",

Hojlund managed just four goals for United last term and found himself slipping down the pecking order following Ruben Amorim's attacking restructure.",

I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.\"",

      "\"It's more difficult, but I trust in my players, and if we are really focused, we can win. I think it's impossible to replace Bruno, but I said to the team we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing, that a lot of people need to step up.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"If you see it's not just the creation [from Fernandes], it's every set-piece when the guy is organising sometimes the team, which is a good opportunity for everyone to step up. They need to understand we cannot rely on one player for everything, and sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We have lost Bruno, Amad and Bryan for set-pieces, so this is massive for the team, but it's an opportunity for other players to step up and show leadership in the team.",
      "\"He understands every position on the field, every detail and every set-piece; he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. That is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha [Martinez] and Luke Shaw, all these guys, we need to step up to have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "United's injuries opened the door for Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey to make their debuts against Villa. \"They are normal, they are good kids,\" said Amorim when asked how the pair have reacted.",
      "\"The behaviour they have shown during these weeks is really good, but I don't have that feeling that they are a little bit different because they play for Manchester United. They are really focused, and they are preparing the game. They believe they can play, so that is a good feeling.\"",
      "Amorim was without multiple key players at Villa Park last weekend, but Newcastle have a dismal away record this season. Newcastle won 2-0 at Old Trafford last December, which was a miserable month for Amorim. The Magpies subsequently beat United 4-1 at St. James' Park when the two sides met again in April.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the Boxing Day Premier League clash with Newcastle this week.",
      "Amorim confirmed in his press conference Bruno Fernandes is out for the foreseeable, including the fixture on Friday night. He is joined in the injury room by Kobbie Mainoo who suffered a calf issue prior to the loss at Aston Villa.",
      "The United boss confirmed Mainoo would be back before Fernandes but would not give a timeframe for the captain's return. Amorim also stressed the Portuguese midfielder's absence was a chance for the leadership team to step up.",
      "Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are also out of this game but there was better news on their fitness. While Boxing Day has come too soon for their return, they could be back for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers next Tuesday.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in the blog below...",
      "Amorim has challenged Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw to \"step up\" in the dressing room in the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who picked up a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes was brought off at half-time against Villa, and he will be unavailable when United take on Newcastle on Boxing Day. Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival in Manchester in January 2020, but Amorim will have to manage without his captain. Amorim confirmed Fernandes would miss the Boxing Day clash at his pre-Newcastle press conference, and he discussed how the team would cope without the Portugal international in the side.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo will be unavailable for Manchester United's game against Newcastle due to injury. Fernandes started against Aston Villa last weekend, but he was brought off at half-time after holding his hamstring. Mainoo was absent from the squad in Birmingham after picking up an injury in training. Amorim confirmed Fernandes had suffered a muscle injury following the Villa defeat, but the United boss provided a further team news update during his Christmas Eve press conference. Speaking about Fernandes and Mainoo, he said: \"No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the press conference. The second part of the press conference is embargoed until 10.30pm this evening.",
      "Everything. Everything because he understands every position on the field. He pays attention to every detail. Every set piece when you have a substitution, he is always the guy who is telling the other guys where they should be. But that is a very good opportunity for guys like Licha, Luke Shaw, all these guys. We need to have more leaders to step up because this can happen to Bruno, it is not usual, but this can happen, so it is a big opportunity for the other guys.",
      "It is impossible to replace Bruno but I say that this morning to the team, I think we need to take the good thing if there is a good thing on that, that a lot of people need to step up. It is not just the creation, it is every set piece he is the guy who is organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and understand that we can't rely on one player for everything. Sometimes we rely on Bruno in the organisation, in the creation. We lost Bruno in set pieces we lost Bryan (Mbeumo) in those set pieces so this is massive for the team but it is an opportunity for players to step up and to show the leadership we need in the team.",
      "They are normal, they are good kids. The behaviour they have shown during this week are really good. I don't have the feeling that they were a little bit different because I played them for Manchester United. No, they are really focused, they are preparing for the game and they believe that they can play. That is a good feeling, so nothing different to what I saw in the last few weeks.",
      "I am confident we can win any game. Of course, we have some problems but I believe in the team even without many players in this moment I believe in the team and I believe that we can win any game. Of course, it is more difficult but, again, I trust in my players and if we are really focused in the game, we can win.",
      "No, not for this game [Newcastle], they are recovering. I don’t think it will take a lot of time, I think Kobbie will return faster than Bruno. I don’t want to say. I have an idea, of course, but let’s see. We have other players, we need to maybe see different ways of playing. I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job, and that’s why when we have these opportunities, we need to give space to guys like Jack and the other ones.",
      "We are still working with them [Maguire and De Ligt] They are not available for this one, but let’s see for the next one.",
      "Amorim is here and the press conference will begin shortly...",
      "It won't be long until we hear from Amorim for the final time before Christmas",
      "As we head into Christmas, United are sitting in a better position than they were last year. In 2024, the Reds had 22 points and sat 13th. This year, Amorim's men are up to seventh but more importantly are four points better off. Presuming United do not have a second half of the campaign as bad as last season, the Reds are on track to perform much better this campaign.",
      "We are just less than 30 minutes away from Amorim's press conference. Will the United boss be in the festive spirit this afternoon as he previews Boxing Day?",
      "United would rather not be heading into the January transfer window needing to bring players in. Time and time again we have been told the winter market benefits sellers rather than buyers, but needs must. Despite all the money spent in the summer, United are still lacking options. Amorim knows this and addressed the situation before the trip to Villa Park on Sunday. \"The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment.\"",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United are set to appoint Paul Midgley as their new head of youth recruitment. Midgley has worked in the same role at Newcastle, but he will swap St. James Park for Old Trafford. United have been searching for a new head of academy recruitment since Luke Fedorenko accepted an offer to work for a football agency. Fedorenko played a crucial role in landing top youth signings during his time in Manchester, but he decided it was time for a new chapter after Nick Cox's exit.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "It may be a quieter press conference room than usual due to it being Christmas Eve but there is plenty to discuss prior to Boxing Day. Here's what could be on the agenda:",
      "Ahead of the January transfer window, it appears Rashford is more keen than ever to stay at Barcelona beyond the end of his current loan deal which expires at the culmination of the campaign. Speaking to the media, he said:",
      "Barcelona is a fantastic club, a huge, huge club that is known for winning, and this type of, I want to say pressure, but it’s not a bad type of pressure, it’s a pressure I want to have when playing football. If I’m at a club that doesn’t demand these things, then it’s more difficult for me to be motivated. It’s a fantastic environment for me to continue my football journey. I try to do my best and try to push the team to win, and in the summer, we will see what happens.",
      "Amorim is highly unlikely to want to talk about Rashford in his press conference today.",
      "It's going to be a strange experience for Bruno Fernandes on Boxing Day when he sits down to watch United and is unable to influence the action. Whether Fernandes has his hamstring wrapped up in the warm at home, or has his big coat on at Old Trafford, he isn't going to know what to do with himself when his teammates take on Newcastle United. Fernandes is 31 and a veteran of 683 appearances for club and country, but astonishingly, he has missed only four games in his career through injury. Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like. The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In last week's pre-match press conference, all the build-up surrounded the comments made by Fernandes in an interview with Portuguese media. This time, Fernandes is in the spotlight once more but due to his injury picked up at Villa. There are reports the captain could be out for a month but we should know more when Amorim speaks this afternoon.",
      "Amorim is due to speak to the United media at 1.15pm with the embargo lifting at 1.30pm. We will get the quotes from the press conference as soon as we can after that!",
      "Good morning and welcome along to our Amorim press conference blog on Christmas Eve!",
      "Make sure to stick right here as we build up to the United boss speaking this afternoon. Ahead of the Boxing Day fixture, the Reds have a number of injury issues which need addressing.",
      "Fernandes, Mainoo, Maguire and De Ligt are all expected to be out against Newcastle. The midfield absentees are a huge blow for United and will provide Amorim with a headache over his Christmas dinner.",
      "Stay tuned for all the build-up to Amorim's press conference..."

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN’s Manchester United transfer live blog for December 24.",
      "Christmas is almost upon us but before then, Ruben Amorim will speak to the media to deliver any updates ahead of their Boxing Day clash with Newcastle United on Friday (8pm). The transfer window will then reopen a few days later and United could be one of the busier teams in the market.",
      "A replacement for Bruno Fernandes, who picked up an injury in Sunday's defeat to Aston Villa, is on their radar and a new attacker is being eyed by Amorim. Although the Reds have been linked with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, talks between Manchester City and Bournemouth are progressing.",
      "Before Fernandes was handed a spell on the sidelines, United had already begun planning a midfield reshuffle. Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton are among the players under consideration, while the situation surrounding Kobbie Mainoo's future at Old Trafford is expected to influence how those plans develop next month.",
      "Brighton and Hove Albion sporting director Jason Ayto has predicted that Carlos Baleba will return to his best in the second half of the season, amid links to United.",
      "United made an approach to Brighton in the summer transfer window, but a move never happened.",
      "Baleba has since endured a difficult stat to the season, and has even started some games on the bench. But Ayto believes that he is getting back to his best.",
      "“He’s getting stronger and stronger as the season goes on,\" he told the Athletic. “We’re really looking forward to watching him represent his country in the AFCON, and we’re really excited to get him back.",
      "“He’s a happy, strong, energetic Carlos who’s really good for us. I think he’s going to go from strength to strength in the second half of the season.”",
      "Hello United fans, Happy Christmas Eve!",
      "My name is Amie and I will be with you throughout this afternoon and evening, bringing you the latest Unied news and rumours ahead of the January transfer window opening in just over a week.",
      "First, here's a look at some of the things that you may have missed so far today:",
      "Marcus Rashford makes Man United feelings clear with new Barcelona admission - 'What I want'",
      "Man United can save millions on Elliot Anderson alternative with clever January transfer agreement",
      "Manchester United set to poach staff member from Premier League rival",
      "Man United have three January transfer options to strengthen squad - but one should be avoided",

      "Read the full story here.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, a recent review of accounts submitted to the FIGC revealed that Napoli have exceeded the permitted limit for labour costs relative to revenue.",
      "Formal confirmation is still pending, but the club are already operating under the assumption that January will effectively be a 'zero‑balance' window.",
      "As a result, talks for high‑profile targets have been put on hold, including a potential move for Mainoo, which is now effectively 'frozen'.",
      "Bidon's agent has addressed the transfer rumours amid reports that Man United are monitoring the midfielder.",
      "\"From the big European clubs, I don't know which one I haven't spoken to,\" he said. \"Any club you mention, at some point, we have already had some enquiry, relationship or contact.",
      "\"That doesn’t mean it will turn into a formal offer. The moment for Breno to go to Europe will come. That's a fact. But we’re in no rush. The great challenge is not going to Europe or making a big sale. The real challenge is sustaining a new project, like we did at Corinthians.\"",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Man United were 'prepared to change their system' to ensure they secured Semenyo in January.",
      "\"Man City believe they won this crazy race,\" he said on his YouTube channel. \"The reaction from Man Utd is, 'We tried our best.'",
      "\"Man Utd made their best effort, be it tactical or financial. United made a very important financial offer to Semenyo. They pushed like crazy.",
      "\"They were even prepared to change the system to welcome Semenyo. But Ruben Amorim indicated that he only wants players who want to be at Manchester United, who want to wear the shirt, 'We don’t want players who are not convinced.' Even last summer, with Viktor Gyokeres, get Champions League football, no Champions League football, United [said] okay, so game over [from United's perspective].\"",
      "Romano added: \"I’ve been telling you that Manchester United, in the conversations they had with Antoine Semenyo, made clear that they were even prepared to change the system to welcome Antoine Semenyo at the club.",
      "\"So Semenyo was not going to play wing-back. The idea of Man United was even to open doors to a different system with Semenyo up front. But despite an important financial effort, because United, especially yesterday, made an important financial effort to try to get the player, despite their tactical effort to welcome Semenyo, to try to find the best tactical way. They didn’t get the green light from Semenyo.\"",
      "The Sun suggests Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott has been added to a four‑man shortlist of Premier League midfielders being monitored by Man United.",

      "Scott is under contract at Bournemouth until 2028.",
      "Former Man United midfielder Ravel Morrison has commented on Ruben Amorim's handling of Mainoo.",
      "Speaking on the Filthy Fellas podcast, Morrison said: \"They’re taking the p***. He’s a top player isn’t he? I know you can’t really say it’s bad just coming on for a minute.",
      "\"But I don’t know if they brought him on just to take the p*** just for a minute because he should really be playing a lot more than that.\"",
      "Sancho has been supported by fellow Man United outcast Marcus Rashford after a cryptic message on his social media.",

A direct goal contribution is yet to arrive for Sancho at Villa Park with the 25-year-old playing just 529 minutes in all competitions.",
      "Sancho has not made it off the bench in two of Villa's last three league games with Unai Emery side on an impressive run. Their latest triumph came against United with Sancho ineligible to play against his parent club.",
      "In the wake of that clash, Sancho has uploaded a number of pictures to his Instagram page. One of those includes a quote that reads: \"You gotta serve a purpose to be around me in my new season. It's real personal.\"",

      "In October, ahead of Rashford's first El Clasico against Real Madrid, he made his stance on his future clear, stating that he wants to remain in Spain. Speaking to Sport this week, Rashford reiterated his ambition to stay and help Barca win titles.",
      "\"Of course what I want is to stay at Barca,\" he told the Barcelona-based media outlet Sport. \"It's an end goal, but it's not the reason why I'm training hard and giving it my best.",

      "Rashford also said that his move to Barcelona has given him the pressure he 'wants' as a player. \"There is pressure here, but it is not a negative pressure, but the one you want as a player, the one I want and have always wanted as a footballer,\" he added.",

      "Our coverage has now come to a close, but you can continue to keep up with all of the latest Reds news and headlines on our homepage, here.",
      "Manchester United have been told that Benjamin Sesko is experiencing the same problems as Rasmus Hojlund did. Ruben Amorim's striker signing has endured a challenging start to his first season at Old Trafford with just two goals to his name from 13 appearances.",
      "A knee injury and the form of Mason Mount has seen him offered limited minutes in United's front three alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With the latter away at AFCON, Sesko could be set for an extended run in the team having recently returned from a five-week absence.",
      "However, Paul Parker has explained why he expects him to continue struggling. The former United defender has referenced Hojlund's difficulties in his analysis of how the Slovenia international's strengths are not being utilised.",
      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim will be heading into 2026 without their star player in Bruno Fernandes after he sustained a muscle injury in Sunday's Premier League defeat to Aston Villa.",
      "Fernandes picked up the issue towards the end of the first half at Villa Park before coming off at half-time. Reports have suggested that the United captain could be out for at least a month with a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\". However, Amorim has claimed the club must not make any mistakes in the next transfer window in rushing into signings.",
      "Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has made his preference on his next destination clear ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Both Manchester City and Manchester United are among a number of Premier League clubs to have enquired about the Ghana international in recent weeks and months. Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have also been linked with the player, but the indication has always been that the two Manchester clubs were leading the chase.",
      "David Ornstein claims that Antoine Semenyo's preference come January is to join Manchester City rather than United. Taking to X, he wrote: \"Antoine Semenyo preference is to join Man City in January.",

      "It's been another busy week in M16. A 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last week, a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday, speculation around the future of Kobbie Mainoo and an injury for Bruno Fernandes, not to mention attempts to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "The club is expected to be active in the January transfer window, but Amorim has stated they will only pursue players who fit the club’s long-term vision. He ruled out signing \"short-term fixes\" to cover for injuries or players at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "Manchester United are \"pushing hard\" to beat rivals Manchester City and Liverpool to the signing of Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. Reports from Fabrizio Romano suggest the club are eager to trigger his £65 million release clause early in the January window, there is however competition from Chelsea who are reported to have made an approach to Bournemouth.",
      "Joleon Lescott says he isn't surprised by the impact Marcus Rashford is having at Barcelona. The on-loan Manchester United star departed for Spain this summer.",
      "Having fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, Rashford initially moved to Aston Villa temporarily in January before heading out on another loan to Barcelona in July.",
      "Since joining the Catalan giants, Rashford has enjoyed plenty of minutes. Hansi Flick trusted the 28-year-old out left in the absence of Raphinha and he has also been deployed as a striker. Rashford has scored seven goals and grabbed 11 assists in all competitions so far this season.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte has launched a fresh dig at United following victory in the Italian Supercoppa.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Ravel Morrison has slammed Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo, with the manager repeatedly overlooking him for the starting eleven. The academy product has been restricted to limited playing time this season, having lost his position in the squad.",
      "The 20-year-old emerged from the youth setup during the 2023/24 campaign but has yet to begin a Premier League match for United this term. He has featured for merely 212 minutes from the bench and nearly left Old Trafford during the summer transfer window.",
      "United anticipate interest in the youngster when the New Year arrives, though only an 'exceptional offer' would prompt the club to contemplate a sale. Morrison, who similarly progressed through the academy ranks, failed to secure a regular berth despite being earmarked for stardom at the club.",
      "With Mainoo facing comparable circumstances, Morrison has challenged Amorim's approach towards the midfielder. Speaking on the Filthy Fellas podcast and appearing to reference the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace when Mainoo came on in stoppage time, he said: \"They're taking the p***. He's a top player isn't he? I know you can't really say it's bad just coming on for a minute.",
      "\"But I don't know if they brought him on just to take the p*** just for a minute because he should really be playing a lot more than that.",
      "\"He needs a run of games because you've seen the level he can play at. Do you know what I mean? But he does need a run of games.\"",
      "The 32-year-old then delivered a playful jibe at the Portuguese manager, saying: \"You know what? I don't know what system United play. I only watch Arsenal isn't it?\"",
      "Following just three senior outings for United, Morrison subsequently turned out for Birmingham, QPR, Cardiff and Lazio.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim has encouraged Mainoo to battle for his position in the squad, though it's uncertain whether he'll stay at Old Trafford beyond the January transfer window.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job,\" Amorim declared this week. \"I think that it's not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old.",
      "\"I remember [Cristiano] Ronaldo was on the bench, [Wayne] Rooney was on the bench sometimes. [Juan Sebastian] Veron was not playing.",
      "\"I remember all the history of Manchester United and [there is] nobody this didn't fall [to], so let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise.",
      "\"Believe it or not, I just want to want to help the team to win and help Kobbie to be a better player.\"",

      "There are certainly similarities between Rasmus Hojlund and Benjamin Sesko. Two young strikers asked to become the main man at Manchester United at a young age, on the back of limited experience and with a hefty price tag weighing them down.",
      "It all proved too much for Hojlund, the Dane, who signed for a fee rising to £72million, had to wait until Boxing Day for his first Premier League goal and only ever delivered in flickers. By the end of his second season at Old Trafford, it was apparent that United were hunting for a new striker, and Hojlund would be rebuilding elsewhere.",
      "After a window focusing on attacking reinforcements and with several strikers considered, it was Sesko who made the move to Manchester. He had been watched closely by Arsenal for almost a year, only for the Gunners to sign Viktor Gyokeres, who forced his way into the elite bracket under Ruben Amorim at Sporting.",
      "Sesko's start has been fine, nothing more and nothing less. He is still only 22 and as well as adapting to a new league, he is working his way into a new system. After five weeks out through injury, he returned to the starting line-up at Aston Villa on Sunday and missed a couple of presentable first-half chances, but Amorim is in no doubt the Slovenian will come good.",
      "\"He is returning to competition, really fast, he is going to improve a lot, the idea was 70-75 (minutes), he stopped for a while,\" said Amorim. \"He had that problem (food poisoning) that takes away your physicality. So we are trying to help the players winning the games and trying to control everything. I think he did well. He fought a lot. He’s going to improve.\"",
      "The issue for Hojlund last season was that games would pass him by. He didn't get enough chances, partly through a lack of service and partly because he didn't do enough to carve out opportunities for himself.",
      "There were 21 occasions last season when Hojlund failed to take a single shot in a game, and in 13 of those games, he played 57 minutes or more. For Sesko so far this season, there have been four instances where he didn't take a shot in a game, but these have occurred in matches where he played for 38 minutes, 45 minutes, 33 minutes, and 22 minutes.",
      "The stats tell their own story. Last season, Hojlund averaged 1.44 shots per 90 minutes in the Premier League. So far this season, Sesko is averaging 2.39 shots per 90 minutes. Those are clearly encouraging numbers. The conversion rate is roughly similar, but while Hojlund felt starved of service and would let his emotions show, Sesko is getting the chances. That is the good news.",
      "He would have wanted more than two goals to show for those efforts and he will admit his finishing needs to be sharper, but that is something within his control. In his RB Leipzig career, he scored 27 Bundesliga goals from an xG of 17.6, which suggests he is normally a ruthless finisher.",
      "It is far too early to be worrying about Sesko after his £73.7million move in the summer. Dig a little deeper and the stats will tell you that he is already offering more than Hojlund did, even if the Dane is finding his feet at Napoli.",
      "With Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Bruno Fernandes now injured, United need another attacker to come to the party over the next month. Sesko might just be that man.",

      "Manchester United would rather not be heading into the January transfer window needing to bring players in. Time and time again we have been told the winter market benefits sellers rather than buyers, but needs must. Despite all the money spent in the summer, United are still lacking options.",
      "Ruben Amorim knows this and addressed the situation before the trip to Villa Park on Sunday. \"The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment.\"",
      "Too often, United have tried to bandage over the cracks in their team by signing loan players until the end of the season with no view to purchasing them permanently. Wout Weghorst and Marcel Sabitzer were prime examples of this and the cycle needs to end.",
      "Unfortunately for Amorim, sometimes you have to loosen your principles in the short-term. Players like Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are highly unlikely to leave in January and are therefore targets for the summer transfer window instead. That being said, there are options this winter who could prove to be good acquisitions for now and the future.",
      "Atletico Madrid's Conor Gallagher would be a great option to add to the midfield. It was puzzling Chelsea allowed him to leave for Spain and his performances in La Liga and the Champions League have shown he could still perform for United.",
      "He is a relatively low risk transfer too having played in England previously. He could be available on loan in January and that would suit United perfectly but if the Reds could make that deal permanent in the summer, he would be an upgrade on who is available to them right now.",
      "Ruben Neves is another option on the cards this January. The Portuguese midfielder has been playing for Al Hilal since leaving Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2023.",
      "A return to Molineux is off the table for Neves and while the Saudi Pro League is vastly inferior to the Premier League, at 28 he still has time on his side. The midfielder wants to leave the Middle East at the end of his contract and Al Hilal are open to offers of £15m or more in January to recoup some of their money.",
      "While more of a risk than Gallagher, Neves would still be an improvement to the midfield if he were to join. The final realistic option available this January is Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Premier League clubs are on high alert this winter after discovering the 25-year-old has a release clause which will become active in the upcoming window. It would take £65m to sign Semenyo in January but United will need to act quick to sign him.",
      "Bournemouth have ensured the clause is only going to be active for part of the window to avoid themselves being left with limited time to find a replacement. The forward has eight goals and three assists in 17 appearances this season and is clearly a talent.",
      "United are not overwhelmed by forward options, particularly with Bryan Mbeumo at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). However, the Reds should avoid him in January.",
      "This decision has nothing to do with Semenyo or his incredible talent. But, the Reds have a limited budget and signing a striker is not the priority right now.",
      "Perhaps if United had not got a midfield crisis this January, a move for Semenyo would make perfect sense. As it happens they do though, and thus the Reds should prioritise the long-term concern rather than addressing a short-term issue.",
      "Amorim said on Friday: \"Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it’s not the position that we need more [right now].\" This was a clear hint United will not be looking to alter their priorities for an issue which should resolve itself in mid-January.",
      "Semenyo is a great player, but he is not worth changing United's transfer strategy for.",

      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno? In a week when Manchester United had to consider the possibility of losing their best player after his unexpected comments about his future, they are about to get a taste of what life without Fernandes might actually be like.",
      "The 31-year-old reckons United's powerbrokers wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the \"courage\" to go through with it. His performances this season have once again made him indispensable, but after picking up a hamstring injury at Aston Villa, he now faces a spell on the sidelines.",
      "What are the patterns they can take from those four defeats? These are the games and what sticks out from a Fernandes-less United.",
      "Fernandes wasn't really missing back in May. He was at the Gtech Community Stadium, but spent the whole game sat on the bench. It summed up how United's focus had turned away from the Premier League and towards the Europa League.",
      "Amorim's selection shows how priorities had changed and maybe this game belongs in a category of its own. There were starts for Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi. United added gloss to the scoreline but were 4-1 down with eight minutes to go. Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad got the goals and only one of that trio will be available on Boxing Day.",
      "With Fernandes absent, it was Kobbie Mainoo who played next to Manuel Ugarte, another option that is off the table against Newcastle. Amad came on at half-time and he and Garnacho provided some spark to the attack, but that won't be possible now.",
      "Maybe the most relevant game of them all, given Newcastle will be the first opponents United confront without Fernandes. The captain was suspended after being sent off against Wolves, and this was a grim day nobody wants to remember.",
      "Newcastle were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes and it felt like they declared after that. Joshua Zirkzee was hooked after 33 minutes and booed off. Casemiro was given such a run around that it felt like it might be the end for him at Old Trafford.",
      "United mustered just one shot on target as they lost for the fourth game in a row. \"It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "On this occasion, it was Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in midfield, but the ageing duo were run ragged by Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. That trio will be licking their lips at the chance to inflict more damage on the United midfield.",
      "The second of two successive games that Fernandes missed with a knee injury. This time, United managed two shots on target and were comfortably held at bay by an Arsenal side still pushing for the title.",
      "United went into the game with a midfield trio of Sofyan Amrabat, Mainoo and Scott McTominay, while Erik ten Hag finally handed a chance to Amad. That is at least something to emerge from the wreckage of the defeats without Fernandes.",
      "There was a lack of creativity on show and with injuries forcing Ten Hag to field Jonny Evans and Casemiro together in the centre of defence, United did well to keep the score down to one.",
      "That was a marked improvement from what happened at Selhurst Park six days earlier. This was a defeat that should have sounded the death knell for the Ten Hag era.",
      "United were ripped to shreds in South London, when Palace had four goals by the 66th minute and could have easily had more. It remains one of the worst nights in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, which is saying something.",
      "Palace racked up 10 shots on target to a pitiful two for United, who played with no intensity or imagination. A midfield of Mainoo, Eriksen and Mount might look good on paper, but they were trampled all over.",
      "Ten Hag insisted after the game that \"I will keep fighting\" and somehow United beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final a few weeks later. Thankfully, Fernandes was fit for that one.",
      "Four games without Fernandes and four defeats. Three of them without scoring, and two of them scoring highly on the embarrassment scale. It doesn't bode well.",
      "United managed 10 shots on target in those four games, but half of those were in the chaotic game at Brentford, which had a significant end-of-season vibe.",
      "Across those four games, United created an expected goals (xG) tally of 3.2, of which around half came at Brentford. Fernandes might be playing a deeper role, but he is still miles clear when it comes to creating chances and in his absence, it's pretty clear that there will be fewer opportunities, which is going to put a premium on taking them.",

      "Jadon Sancho has been supported by fellow Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford after a cryptic message on his social media. Sancho and Rashford joined Aston Villa and Barcelona on loan, respectively, this past summer with the attackers enduring very different temporary spells thus far.",
      "A direct goal contribution is yet to arrive for Sancho at Villa Park with the 25-year-old playing just 529 minutes in all competitions. Rashford meanwhile, has featured far more regularly in Spain with seven goals and 11 assists from 24 appearances.",
      "Given the attacking quality at Hansi Flick's disposal, the 28-year-old has been forced to make several of his appearances from the bench. That was the case this past weekend for his side's La Liga win over Villareal with the Spanish media issuing a clear verdict on his cameo.",
      "Sancho has not made it off the bench in two of Villa's last three league games with Unai Emery side on an impressive run. Their latest triumph came against United with Sancho ineligible to play against his parent club.",
      "In the wake of that clash, Sancho has uploaded a number of pictures to his Instagram page. One of those includes a quote that reads: \"You gotta serve a purpose to be around me in my new season. It's real personal.\"",
      "Rashford, Bruno Fernandes and Tyrell Malacia were the United players to like his post while Villa stars Amadou Onana, Matty Cash and Ian Maatsen commented.",
      "Sancho's next start for Villa is likely to be in the FA Cup third round clash against Tottenham in early January. Before then, Emery's side have a very challenging schedule as they face Arsenal, Chelsea and Crystal Palace away from home alongside a clash against Nottingham Forest on home soil.",
      "United meanwhile, are at the opposite end of the spectrum and arguably have the easiest games over the festive period. After hosting Newcastle United, who have won just once away from home in the league, United welcome Wolves to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side then travel to newly-promoted Leeds United and Burnley in early 2026. Unfortunately, United may need to navigate those fixtures without club captain Bruno Fernandes after he appeared to suffer a hamstring injury against Villa.",
      "Amorim said after the game: \"Bruno has an injury that we need to assess. I think he's not going to play for a few games, but we'll see.",
      "\"Last year we had the same situation at this time, so it is not going to kill us - it is going to make us stronger.\"",
      "For well over a month, United have been without Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt while Kobbie Mainoo has also picked up a minor issue.",
      "With Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at AFCON over the coming weeks, United could have done with players like Sancho or Rashford.",

Two of those were for Portugal in the March 2019 international break and then two for United in May 2024. He has missed two more games due to illness, in 2017 and 2022, and that is it.",
      "It's a remarkable injury record, but one that was unlikely to last as age caught up with the durable Portugal international. The sight of him clutching his hamstring just before half-time at Villa Park on Sunday confirmed Ruben Amorim's worst fears.",
      "Amorim will offer an update on Fernandes' fitness when he holds his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, but he is expected to be absent for around a month. Amorim might also offer a few clues as to how he might replace his captain, although he is arguably irreplaceable.",
      "Fernandes has again been the beating heart of this team this season. Playing slightly ahead of Casemiro, he has 12 goal involvements in 17 Premier League games and set the tone for performances, as he often does.",
      "Amorim has two issues now. How to replace Fernandes in the team and who to hand the captain's armband to. Let's start with the first problem.",
      "In truth, there aren't a lot of options. Kobbie Mainoo will be frustrated that a calf problem has denied him the chance to earn a first start of the season. Amorim has said all season that the 20-year-old is competing for a place with Fernandes, but now he finds himself sitting next to him in the physio's room.",
      "That only leaves Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte. The former will return to the team after serving a suspension on Sunday and perhaps the Uruguayan will keep his place. That would likely mean Casemiro being given the freedom to get forward in the way that Fernandes does.",
      "Amorim ruled out Lisandro Martinez as a regular midfield option last month, but the Argentine looked good there at Villa Park. He is only going to play the holding role, however, and is currently competing with Ugarte for that position.",
      "If Amorim wants a more progressive option, he could turn to 18-year-old Jack Fletcher, who came on for the final 17 minutes on Sunday, or drop Mason Mount back from his position as one of the No. 10s. That would mean Joshua Zirkzee coming in alongside Matheus Cunha. The knock-on effect is that United would have no senior attacking options on the bench.",
      "Amorim will also have to decide who to hand the captain's armband to. It was Diogo Dalot who took it for the second half at Villa and he described that as \"a very proud moment\".",
      "The only game Fernandes hasn't started this season was the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, when Harry Maguire was skipper, but Maguire is now absent with a thigh problem. In the Premier League, the last time Fernandes didn't start was at Brentford in May, when Luke Shaw was captain. Maguire and Diogo Dalot were also missing that day as focus turned to the Europa League.",
      "At Wolves, a couple of weeks earlier, it was the now departed Victor Lindelof who captained United. The only other time Fernandes didn't start in the league last season was against Newcastle nearly a year ago, when Lisandro Martinez wore the armband. That's four different captains in four Premier League games without Fernandes in 2024/25.",
      "The fact that Dalot was captain while Shaw and Martinez were on the pitch would suggest he is now ahead of them. He is in the six-man leadership group named in the summer, alongside Fernandes, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui, Martinez and Maguire. Of that six, Dalot is the only guaranteed starter on Boxing Day and the only other player from that group who could feature is Martinez.",
      "Casemiro was suspended against Aston Villa but has some leadership experience. He has captained Brazil on 18 occasions, although never skippered Real Madrid. He has worn the armband twice from the off against United, in a 4-0 Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace and a 3-0 Carabao Cup loss to Newcastle.",
      "So everything points to Dalot getting the captaincy in Fernandes' absence. Who replaces him in midfield might be a little trickier.",

      "Like Baleba, the England internationals are likely to cost in the region of £100m, the sort of deal that United may be able to afford, but that could impact their ability to do other deals.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There could be some cheaper options in the market, especially with the free agents that will be available next summer, with the possibility of striking an agreement on a pre-contract in January.",
      "Perhaps the top option for any club looking to improve their midfield is Ruben Neves, who is coming to the end of his contract with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "While he is approaching three years since playing in the Premier League last, the Portuguese midfielder has still ben playing at the top level with his performances for both club and country.",
      "At 28, he is approaching his peak years and could offer plenty for United in adding some quality on the ball and some leadership within the team.",
      "On top of that is his dynamic with Bruno Fernandes, with the pair playing together often for the Portuguese national team, showing their understanding when playing together at the base of the midfield.",
      "Beyond Neves, there are several other free agent options who could help Man United save millions in the market by agreeing a pre-contract this January.",
      "Weston McKennie is nearing the final few months of his contract at Juventus, with the 27-year-old facing the possibility of an exit - though there may be reservations after his previous spell in the Premier League with rivals Leeds a few seasons ago, where he struggled to make an impression.",
      "Quinten Timber, the brother of Arsenal star Jurrien Timber, is also close to the end of his contract as he looks set to move on from Feyenoord after some impressive performances in the side - and at 24 he could potentially grow even further.",
      "It remains to be seen if any of those would be realistic targets for the United recruitment team, however, as their sights are firmly set on a player who could hold down the midfield for the future.",
      "Luke Thrower is part of the Trends team at Football.London, with experience covering Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham. He also holds a keen interest in covering tactical and statistical content as well as the business side of football.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is facing at least one month out of action after suffering from an injury in his side's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.",
      "That's according to The Telegraph, who report that the club captain sustained a \"suspected soft-tissue injury\", which saw him forced off at half-time at Villa Park.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker was seen struggling through the first half of the match, with the second half seeing him replaced by Lisandro Martinez, who took up the midfield role instead.",
      "The injury for Fernandes comes as a blow to Man United at the worst possible time, with three game-changers in Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, and Noussair Mazraoui all away on international duty with their respective nations for the Africa Cup of Nations over the next month or so.",
      "That has already seen Ruben Amorim dealt a depleted squad, which was evident with his reliance on younger players in the defeat on Sunday.",
      "The loss of Fernandes is a particularly huge blow, considering how crucial he has been to their recent uptick in form, picking up five goals and seven assists from his deeper midfield role.",
      "Speaking about the injury after the game, Amorim said: \"I think it's a soft-tissue injury so it's going to be a while. He is a guy who is always fit so we hope he can recover well. We will see.",
      "\"It's an injury and sometimes it’s bad luck or something else at the same time. You can never control these things.",
      "\"We will need to find solutions and we cannot use anything as an excuse. We need to prepare all the guys that we have for the next game.",
      "\"No one is going to remember these problems, so let’s cope with that. It will make us stronger.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo may finally be given a chance to shine, after calls from all sections of the fanbase for the youngster to be given an opportunity.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite previously proving himself at the top level, which has raised plenty of eyebrows.",
      "Mainoo was absent from the defeat at Villa Park, due to a minor injury picked up in training, which meant he couldn't be the immediate Fernandes replacement on Sunday, but could be for Boxing Day's clash with Newcastle United.",
      "With yet another injury issue, there are some big games for Amorim coming up over the next month that could see the club captain out of action.",
      "With United's last realistic chance of silverware coming in the FA Cup, the loss of Fernandes for the Brighton clash could be huge, on top of his absence for matches against rivals such as Leeds, Manchester City, and Arsenal.",
      "In his absence comes a chance for someone to step up and make themselves a hero, however.",

      "Manchester United could not return to winning ways against Aston Villa on Sunday. United suffered a 2-1 defeat after a brace from Morgan Rogers, who scored a goal in each half of the game.",
      "The Reds would have moved to fifth in the table if they had beaten Villa. They will now go into the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle sitting in seventh position in the top flight.",
      "Matheus Cunha brought the score level just before half-time, but Rogers is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League, and he punished United again following the interval.",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery reacted to the goal by throwing his coat in the air.",
      "Recap what happened at Villa Park here.",
      "Amorim insists United won't rip up their January transfer plans despite losing captain Fernandes to a muscle injury against Aston Villa. Fernandes joined fellow midfielder Mainoo on the injury list after he withdrew on the eve of the game.",
      "Fernandes clutched his hamstring late in the first half at Villa Park and was forced off at the break, with Amorim confirming it was a soft tissue problem. Mainoo injured his calf in training on Saturday and couldn't be part of the squad.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "When Ruben Amorim looks under his tree on Christmas Day, he is likely to be disappointed. The Manchester United head coach could do with finding a couple of midfielders wrapped up, and no pair of socks will make up for the disappointment of not finding Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton ready to pop out of a box.",
      "Amorim suggested on Friday that United were unlikely to sign a midfielder in January, but then he didn't expect to finish the game at Aston Villa with Lisandro Martinez and Jack Fletcher in the middle of the pitch. Christmas should be a time of giving, but it's been a costly week for Amorim and United.",
      "Having seen Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, he saw Kobbie Mainoo limp out of training on Saturday and Bruno Fernandes pull up at the end of the first half. Casemiro's suspension left the outmatched Manuel Ugarte as the only senior midfielder left standing.",
      "Ugarte has fallen out of favour under Amorim, and at times at Villa Park, you could see why. His work in possession was particularly poor. He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Powerless to stop either goal and a solid enough game aside from that. One good first half stop from John McGinn, although might have pushed it wide of goal. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Awful for Rogers' first goal when he never made any attempt to get close to the brilliant playmaker. Looked scared to make a tackle for the second. 4",
      "Ayden Heaven: Stood up well to the challenge posed by an experienced England international. Some good moments against Ollie Watkins and edged that battle. 7",

      "Ugarte has been disappointing again this afternoon and was just handed a card.",

      "Fantastic response after falling behind. Dorgu records an assist.",
      "Awful from Yoro. Rogers gets that ball on the touchline and finishes from 15 yards out well inside the area, without any threat of a challenge. That is pathetic defending and all of United’s good work has been undone.",
      "That's a stunning goal from Rogers, who finds the top right corner from the left of the box.",
      "Ugarte was too weak and Yoro was hugely to blame when Rogers picked it up.",
      "Fernandes picked up a knock a few minutes ago but he has continued.",
      "United got to be happy with how things are going here. They’ve kept Villa quiet for a while now and look the better side at the moment. Starting to show some control, good spells of possession, Cunha looking lively and the Villa Park faithful starting to get really rattled.",
      "Cunha won the ball back and forced a save from Martinez, shooting from the edge of the box.",
      "Two chances fall to Sesko in quick succession and he should do better. First one is a good save from Martinez, but elite strikers would want to be scoring that. Second is the wrong option, touch round the goalkeeper wasn’t on and should have looked to lift it. A promising sign that he is suddenly in the game, however.",
      "Villa made a fast start to this game, but they've dropped off and some of the fans around the press box are beginning to sound frustrated.",
      "Sesko latched onto a ball into the box and should have done a lot better.",
      "Mount offering some advice to Sesko during a break in play. Striker feeding on scraps at the moment, but he is at least offering an outball. Ugarte has had a very shaky start, Fernandes pressing high and holding midfielder being run ragged at times. United have at least steadied the ship after a rocky opening.",
      "Mount has just been shaking his head - he doesn't look happy with the speed United are playing at.",
      "Dalot did well to bring the ball inside and play a pass over the top to Sesko, but it came to nothing.",
      "Mount has started really well and made a strong challenge just before.",
      "Villa just had three big chances. Lammens made a great save, Heaven made a superb block and Rogers came inches from scoring with a clever backheel. Villa have started full of energy and confidence."

He had to fill Fernandes' box-to-box role in the second half and it's difficult to make a case for a team stretched to that degree getting a result against the Premier League's in-form team.",
      "That run of form is built on shaky foundations if you believe the data geeks, but Morgan Rogers is doing his best to condemn the boffins to the bin this season. He is making a habit of scoring stunners, so the solution is to make sure he can't shoot. Instead, Leny Yoro was so busy handing out gifts he should have been wearing a white beard.",
      "He was too passive against Rogers and paid the price twice. It undid a lot of the good work that United put in at Villa Park. For the second game running, they created chances and looked like a threat going forward, but failed to win. It is now two wins in eight.",
      "Villa came out of the blocks quickly, as you would expect of a team on a run of nine successive wins. Ayden Heaven twice had to block shots from Ollie Watkins, Senne Lammens made a save from John McGinn and Rogers reacted quickly to flick an Ian Maatsen drive towards goal in the six-yard box, only to see it squirm just wide.",
      "United settled their rocking ship, however, and should have led by the midway point of the half. Benjamin Sesko found himself in on goal only to be denied by a sprawling save from Emiliano Martinez. A minute later, it was a clever pass from Matheus Cunha that sent Sesko in, but he took a heavy touch when trying to round Martinez, when he should have attempted to lift a first-time finish.",
      "In a stodgy half, it was Rogers and Cunha who had looked like making something happen, and they delivered within minutes of each other. Rogers had nothing on when he picked up possession on the left touchline, but Yoro never got close to the Premier League's in-form player and let him drift into a shooting position, from where he picked his spot clinically.",
      "Thankfully for United, Matty Cash was also in the Christmas spirit. He was caught napping by Patrick Dorgu, with the ball falling to Cunha. The Brazilian had plenty to do, but his unerring finish was measured to perfection.",
      "The half-time loss of Fernandes was a hammer blow for United. The captain had stopped the game after clutching his hamstring, but continued until the break. He even had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ezri Konsa in that period, but couldn't continue. It meant Amorim had to raid his threadbare bench and the promotion of Martinez to midfield showed what he thought of the other options available to him.",
      "Martinez settled into the game quickly, and United started the second half well, but were again undone by a moment of Rogers' magic. The finish was from a similar angle after the ball bounced clear to him, and again, Yoro was too cautious in trying to stop him. His two shots were worth a combined xG of 0.07 on the spreadsheet. Unfortunately for United, the game was being played on the pitch.",
      "The consolation for Amorim was that his team was being beaten by stunners. So stretched were resources that the Portuguese called a truce with the academy, handing out two debuts, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot forced Martinez into a save and Dorgu's follow-up was blocked by Cash. The recalled wing-back then stuck a cross on Cunha's head only for the Brazilian's effort to bounce wide. Lacey managed a shot on target from distance and Mount whipped a free-kick onto the roof of the net.",
      "It was an afternoon when United could count themselves a little unlucky, but the results are flatlining again. Casemiro will return on Boxing Day. Who partners him is anyone's guess.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is absent from the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after he picked up an injury in the final training session before the trip to Villa Park. The injury is described as a \"small issue\", but it is enough to rule the academy graduate out of a game he might have started.",
      "Mainoo is yet to start a game in the Premier League this season and he is eyeing a loan move away from Old Trafford in January, but Ruben Amorim urged him to stay and fight for his place in his press conference ahead of the fixture against the league's in-form side.",
      "Amorim had hinted he could play a back four against Villa, a formation that would have meant three midfielders and would have resulted in an expected promotion for Mainoo, 20, with Casemiro suspended after picking up a fifth booking of the season.",
      "But his cruelly timed injury means he won't get to add to his 212 minutes of Premier League football so far this season. With Mainoo unavailable, Amorim has stuck by his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "United are short of options with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Mainoo has joined Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt on the treatment table.",
      "Amorim was asked about Mainoo during his press conference and urged him to accept his current predicament and prove him wrong, hinting he could be in the side against Villa.",
      "\"Kobbie needs to fight for his job. I think that is not a bad thing to be on the bench of Manchester United when you are 20 years old,\" he said. \"I remember Ronaldo was on the bench, Rooney was on the bench sometimes. Veron was not playing.",
      "\"So let's continue in trying to avoid the nonsense and the noise. I just want to help the team to win. To help Kobbie to be a better player. I'm not trying to say to Kobbie 'You are a big player here, let’s put him on the bench to show something.'",
      "\"No, no. What I’m saying is the opposite. I'm just not putting Kobe sometimes because I understand that this is not the right guy to start the game. Maybe the next game, Sunday he is going to start.",
      "\"If he plays well, is going to show everyone. 'This guy cannot take me for the team', and I will be so happy, so I don't care. I don't want to show nothing to anyone.

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",
      "He said: \"So, basically, he's saying that he's never going to change the system. On Monday night, that's the average positions, that's the graphic. On Monday night, the average position.",
      "\"I mean, look, my eyes, to be fair, at times thought they were deceiving me because I couldn't quite work out what he was doing. It was in no doubt at the end, but it was no doubt he was in 4-2-4 at the end, but he was also during the game; something was different on Monday night.",
      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd are one of two Premier League clubs to have made an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior ahead of the summer, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side were perhaps the better team against Aston Villa on Sunday in their 2-1 defeat with the Red Devils missing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "There were a number of youngsters on the Man Utd bench on Sunday and it now seems the Red Devils are likely to enter the January transfer market for new players.",
      "Man Utd had strong interest in signing Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth until widespread reports claimed that Man City is the Ghana international’s ‘preference’.",
      "With Amorim’s insistence that Man Utd don’t want to rely on short-term fixes, any deal for an attacker could have to wait until the summer, unless another good opportunity arises.",
      "READ: Top 10 post-Christmas title capitulations to frighten Arsenal (who have previous)",
      "And reports in Spain claim that Real Madrid have ‘received two offers of more than €100m’ for Vinicius Junior, one of which has come from the Red Devils.",
      "Real Madrid are struggling to get Vinicius Junior to sign a new deal as the Brazil international wants parity with top earner Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The report adds: ‘Faced with this situation, those at the Bernabeu have decided not to remain idle. Real Madrid are already listening to offers and, according to sources close to the club, two very serious proposals have arrived from the Premier League. Chelsea and Manchester United have put more than €100 million on the table to acquire Vinicius this summer, a figure that, at the very least, compels them to sit down and talk.",
      "‘At Real Madrid, there’s no urgency to sell, but there is concern about losing control of the narrative. Letting time pass without renewing Vinicius ‘ contract could become a strategic problem, especially if the player enters the final stretch of his contract without an agreement. Selling now, with strong offers and room to manoeuvre, is starting to look like a logical option.’",
      "There could be conversations about Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes being involved in the deal for Vinicius Junior in the summer with Spanish website Fichajes claiming Real Madrid see the Portugal international as a ‘realistic option’.",
      "It has been revealed that clubs from outside the Premier League can buy Fernandes for €60m as he has a release clause in his contract and ‘that amount fits within Real Madrid’s parameters for a strategic signing’.",
      "Fichajes adds: ‘Herein lies the main doubt. Bruno Fernandes is 31 years old, a factor that doesn’t quite convince Florentino Pérez. In recent years, the president has opted for young signings with potential and resale value.",
      "‘However, the club also recognizes the need for balance. Incorporating proven experience can be key to supporting an increasingly young squad in crucial moments.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano clarified Fernandes’ release clause earlier this week, he said: “In January, I don’t expect any movement despite all the interviews, all the quotes from Bruno. My expectation is not for Bruno to move in January. Bruno is expected to stay at Man Utd. We will see in summer 2026 what happens. From Saudi they are still interested.",
      "“There is a release clause in the contract of Fernandes. And the clause is not valid for Premier League clubs. It’s only valid for clubs from abroad.",
      "“It’s slightly over €60m, so there would be the possibility for several clubs to attack. But in that case, it depends on what Bruno wants to do.",
      "“Bruno said already in an interview a few days ago that he said no to Saudi, it was Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window. Bruno wanted to stay at Man Utd, but the clause is going to be still there in summer 2026.",
      "“It’s going to be up to Bruno to decide what he wants to do next and what’s going to be the mission for him on the transfer market for summer 2026. As of now, I can guarantee that the focus of Bruno is completely on Man Utd. Bruno wants to do his best for Man Utd.",
      "“Then there is the World Cup with Portugal as well. But in terms of club football, Bruno only wants to focus on United. He is not planning any transfer. It’s from Saudi that they are still very interested in Bruno, but it’s not Bruno entertaining talks or opening discussions already for 2026.”",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is likely to miss the Red Devils’ next six matches, according to reports, after picking up an injury against Aston Villa.",
      "The Sun bring us the exclusive news that an injured player has a limp, while Antoine Semenyo may have made his decision already.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is going to be out for “a while” after he came off injured in their 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has predicted that Bruno Fernandes will be out of action for “a while” after being forced off against Aston Villa.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Bruno Fernandes’ release clause at Man Utd stands at “slightly over €60m”.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has sat down with Rio Ferdinand for an in-depth chat, and here are the five best takeaways from this interview…"

      "Former Man Utd flops Juan Sebastian Veron, Eric Djemba-Djemba, Angel di Maria, Diego Forlan and others will go down as some of the worst deals in the clubs history – but Scholes reckons Bosnich is up there due to his “unprofessional” nature.",
      "When suggested that Veron was the Red Devils’ worst-ever signing, Scholes replied on The Overlap: “Veron was a great player, a talented player. Don’t really know why it didn’t work for him but what a footballer.",

      "“In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he’s knackered, ‘oh no, get someone else in’.",
      "“I never realised, he couldn’t kick a football. I’ve never seen anything like it. We played Everton away in first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it, he couldn’t reach the halfway line.",
      "“There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly he was just kicking the floor all the time, big flippers. Honestly, it was disappointing.”",
      "In Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson also branded Bosnich – who came through the youth ranks at Man Utd – “a terrible professional”.",
      "On Bosnich, who played 38 times in two spells for Man Utd, Ferguson said: “Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known.",
      "“The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "“We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "“I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, ‘Alex, I’m sorry, I’ve shaken hands with Bosnich.’ That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark’s hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.”",
      "When asked about Ferguson’s comments about him, the former Man Utd goalkeeper told FourFourTwo: “It wasn’t unfair – it was just a lie.",
      "“He’s always said that he doesn’t bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he’s got good evidence to back himself up. At that time, though, it was a lie.",

      "As a Christmas treat we always like to revisit our pre-season predictions to get a sneak peek at who is on the way to looking utterly clueless.",
      "The full pre-season predictions are here if you want to have a proper laugh, or we will pick out the highlights…",
      "Starting – as is traditional – with the Premier League champions, this was bold from the boss (me): ‘Not Arsenal. Not having that.’ So guess who is very, very invested in the Gunners f***ing this up as they traditionally do from being top at Christmas.",
      "Dave Tickner was the only F365-er who actually tipped Arsenal, while Matt Stead and Ian Watson also plumped for Manchester City. The rest are already out of the race by tipping Liverpool and Chelsea; this was back in the days when we were dreaming of a four-horse title race.",
      "The top four, which nobody ever gets right? Every single one of us went for a combination of last season’s top four, with Lewis Oldham adding to his Liverpool title prediction with this beauty: ‘Chelsea. Arsenal. Manchester City. Not sold on City as title challengers yet. Arsenal third in the battle for first as real deal Chelsea (26/27 will be their year) to edge out their rivals to second and potentially seal Arteta sack.’",
      "Nobody saw Aston Villa coming.",
      "Let’s get relegation out of the way. Some of us absolutely f***ed it on Sunderland but Joe Williams, Jason Soutar and Lewis Oldham saw the Black Cats surprise coming. There were far too many Brentford shouts, but John Nicholson, Williams and Soutar nailed it on Wolves. Williams may yet still entirely nail it with Wolves, Burnley and Leeds, but that’s expecting a lot of West Ham.",
      "The pleasant surprise of the season? There was a weird volume of excitement about Everton, but points go again to Williams for his Sunderland shout. It looked ridiculous at the time. What looks ridiculous now is Stead: ‘It has been an absolute delight to laugh at them all summer but Newcastle will rise from the cuck chair and excel on the pitch, if not the boardroom, with another top-five finish.’",
      "Also ridiculous was Watson dreaming that Manchester United would sign a ‘midfielder with legs’. He is still waiting.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? ‘This is dull but Erling Haaland. I can’t see Mo Salah coming even vaguely close,’ said Winterburn (me, this is weird). Taking that all day.",
      "We’re still not sure if Johnny was being serious with his Liam Delap call, while Watson bought into the Viktor Gyokeres hype. But once again, we return to Stead: ‘Alexander Isak stays, quickly realises it might not be the best idea to entirely starve oneself of competitive football in a World Cup year and has his Luis Suarez season before getting that move.’",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? There were big shouts for Gyokeres and Joao Pedro, while Will Ford had an inkling for Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at Everton. I did say we were oddly excited about Everton. What’s the actual answer so far? Probably Granit Xhaka or Robin Roefs.",
      "As for the massive flop…I was likely wrong on Hugo Ekitike, but Stead was right on the assorted Chelsea rejects. Williams might have nailed it again as he described Benjamin Sesko as ‘wildly overpriced’ while Tickner might be oddly prescient in suggesting that Gyokeres, Sesko and Ekitike would all struggle to reach double figures.",
      "There were calls for Bryan Mbeumo, Rayan Cherki and Noni Madueke that could be a little wide of the mark, but Ford might have smashed it with Gyokeres. The predictions were written before the Alexander Isak signing so Floppy McFlopface did not get a mention.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? ‘Rayan Cherki feels like a steal at £34m…or a third of a Grealish,’ might be my finest hour. Stead’s Jhon Arias call might not be his, while the least said the better about mentions of Angus Gunn and Kyle Walker-Peters.",
      "PFA Player of the Year will not be Rodri, Cole Palmer or Florian Wirtz. It might be Declan Rice, though. The Spurs fan among us what the only true believer in Arsenal.",
      "The first Premier League manager to be sacked was Nuno Espirito Santo. Once again, we give you Tickner. He confidently wrote: ‘Mr Marinakis is on one right now, positively aglow with main character energy, and the off-field shenanigans cannot mask that Forest ended last season in pretty ropey fashion. And have been honking in pre-season. They only managed eight points from their final nine Premier League games last season – and it wasn’t that tough a run-in either. Start this season anything like the way they ended the last with Marinakis in his current mood to move fast and break things, and Nuno is very quickly in very big trouble.’ No notes.",
      "We always end with ‘in five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season’.",
      "I stand by mine: ‘A proper f***ing title race.’"

      "Arsenal sit top of the table at Christmas for the fifth time in the Premier League era; they have never won the title from this position!",
      "Only Liverpool have been top of the Premier League at Christmas more times and failed to get over the line.",
      "They join Manchester United (twice), Newcastle (twice), Norwich, Aston Villa and Leeds United in knowing the pain of getting over-excited over the turkey only to end the season empty handed, and some of those collapses have been rather spectacular.",
      "Here’s 10 of the worst from the past 33 years, including a handful of particularly notable ones from the lower leagues.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – 2003/04 (Premier League)\nUnited at least had the excuse of going up against Arsenal’s Invincibles, but the depth of United’s post-Christmas drop-off was surprising for a Sir Alex Ferguson side nonetheless.",
      "They had lost just three times before Christmas, with a goalless draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford the only time they had shared the spoils, putting them a point ahead of Arsenal and Chelsea on Christmas Day.",
      "But United dropped points more often than they won them from there: their post-Christmas record was W10, D5, L6, with a 4-1 defeat to away to struggling Manchester City particularly painful, especially as it left Fergie’s side with just two wins in eight games. United ended up finishing third, 15 points adrift of unbeaten Arsenal.",
      "",
      "9) Norwich City – 1992/93 (Premier League)\nTitle-less Norwich had also been top on Christmas Day 1988, only to end up finishing third behind Arsenal and Liverpool. Well, this time it was going to be different! Except, erm, no, it wasn’t.",
      "The Canaries learned nothing from the warning they had provided themselves on their previous trip to the coal mine, and in fact their collapse began just before Christmas: they didn’t win any of their six games between their loss at Old Trafford on 12th December and their 1-1 draw at home to Coventry on 16th January.",
      "Mike Walker’s side remained in indifferent mid-table form for the rest of the campaign, bizarrely alternating between impressive victories and crushing high-scoring defeats. Norwich ended up finishing 12 points behind Manchester United in third – and, very weirdly, with a negative goal difference to boot.",
      "",
      "8) Leeds United – 1999/00 (Premier League)\nLeeds were two points clear at top for the last Christmas of the 20th century (yeah, yeah, shut up, ‘the millennium was actually 2001′ pedants, nobody likes you) partly because they had a game in hand over Manchester United, but again , it’s the sheer depths they sank to from there that makes it notable.",
      "After shrugging off early-season defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, David O’Leary’s Leeds had been almost unstoppable. Only Everton and Wimbledon succeeded in getting anything off them in an impressive run up to and including Boxing Day, with Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell particular stars.",
      "But things immediately nosedived after that: Leeds lost four of their next six, including six-pointers against fellow title hopefuls Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Three straight wins in March briefly revived Leeds’ hopes of pushing Ferguson’s men all the way – they had just four points to make up in their last nine games – but they promptly lost four in a row to put themselves dead in the water and ended up third, some 22 points off the pace.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds United – 2018/19 (Championship)\nAnd what a lovely way to segue to the EFL section of our list. It was Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds this time, and again they were one point clear at the top of the second tier on Christmas Day with exactly half the season’s games played. More importantly for their automatic promotion prospects, they were six ahead of third-placed West Brom.",
      "We’re going to resist the temptation to put their decline down to the infamous spygate incident, not least because Leeds actually lost both their last game of 2018 at home to bottom-half Hull and their New Year’s Day fixture away to Nottingham Forest. Yet despite looking far more fragile and, frankly, knackered than in the first half of the season, Leeds remained in the top two. With just four games to go Bielsa’s side were still in second place, three points clear of third-placed Sheffield United.",
      "Their fixture list was extremely inviting, too: encounters against 21st-placed Wigan, 15th-placed Brentford, fifth-placed Aston Villa, and rock-bottom Ipswich. They got a decent point against Villa, but contrived to lose the other three. That meant Leeds finished six points away from automatic promotion; narrative dictated they must then lose to Derby in the play-off semi finals.",
      "",
      "6) Portsmouth – 2020/21 (League One)\nThat season behind closed doors is one we’d all collective like to forget, but nobody more so than Portsmouth. They led an extremely tight third-tier table on Christmas Day on goal difference and having played a game more than second-placed Lincoln City, but their credentials were supported by Pompey having the best record in the division in both the goals for and goals against columns.",
      "But an abysmal run that started with a four-goal defeat at home to Hull in late January saw Portsmouth plummet to 10th by March, costing manager Kenny Jackett his job.",
      "Hopes of a reviving the season just enough to claim a play-off spot were briefly awakened as new appointment Danny Cowley led Pompey to four wins right off the bat, but they won just two more of their remaining eight games and ended up in eighth place, two points shy of the top six.",
      "",
      "5) Huddersfield Town – 1999/00 (Championship, as it wasn’t called then)\nEnglish football’s first three-in-a-row champions had spent 27 years outside the top flight by the time they sat top of the tree for Christmas 1999, thanks in no small part to Marcus Stewart’s superb form in front of goal.",
      "Steve Bruce’s Terriers won just one game in January and February, however, and compounded their slide to fifth place by unexpectedly selling Stewart to fourth-placed Ipswich Town on 1st February.",
      "Stewart would, naturally, score the winner against Huddersfield less than two weeks later, then help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion via the play-offs; Huddersfield weren’t even involved, having finished the season in eighth place. Stewart scored 19 Premier League goals the following season as Ipswich finished a brilliant fifth; Huddersfield were meanwhile relegated to the third tier. So that worked out well.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool – 1996/97 (Premier League)\nAlright then, back to the Premier League from here, we reckon. And again we return to the 1990s, when a lot of the time you could win titles with a points tally in the 70s. Liverpool were well on course for that by Christmas 1996, when the Spice Girls were top of the charts with 2 Become 1 and the Spice Boys were top of the Premier League. Unfortunately for them, 1 Became 4.",
      "It wasn’t any one extended run of especially awful form that did for them – they never went more than two games without a win – but more a general inability to string together a convincing run of victories: they only did so once in the second half the season, in fact, winning three in a row in January-February.",
      "A series of David James blunders was particularly costly for Roy Evans’ side, whose title hopes were effectively killed off by a 3-1 defeat at home to eventual champions Manchester United with just three games left to play. Newcastle and Arsenal snuck in ahead of the Reds on goal difference on the final day, to boot, leaving Liverpool to finish fourth in a two-horse race.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa – 1998/99 (Premier League)\nIt’s always remarkable to look back on Manchester United’s treble-winning season and remember just how easily they could have ended up completely empty-handed. Case in point: it was John Gregory’s Aston Villa, not United, who sat top of the table on Christmas Day that season.",
      "It didn’t last long: Villa were displaced by a defeat away to Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day, returned very briefly by beating Sheffield Wednesday, then never reclaimed top spot as they embarked on a genuinely miserable second half of the season as Dion Dublin and Julian Joachim’s brilliant goalscoring form dried up.",
      "Villa took just 12 points from their final 16 games of the season, with their only three wins in that run all coming in a vain and far-belated burst of late-season form. They were already down to sixth by that point, and three straight losses to finish the season ensured that was where they finished.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – 2013/14 (Premier League)\nAh, god, do we really need to recap this one? It takes such a high position not because Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool were miles ahead at Christmas, because they weren’t: they were only top on goal difference and just two points ahead of fifth-placed Everton.",
      "Nor is it because Liverpool were notably awful in the second half of the campaign: they were the joint-second best team in the division from Boxing Day onwards, too, dropping just four points between between game 20 on New Year’s Day and game 35 in mid-April.",
      "But come on. You can’t make any list of title capitulations without including Liverpool 2013/14. This does not slip (which he did). Another Istanbul (which they were on the receiving end of from Crystal Palace). Comedy gold.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United – 1995/96 (Premier League)\nA brilliant failure that may never be topped. Ten points. Ten bloody points clear, Newcastle were. Ten points at Christmas. They’d been top of the table since beating Coventry 3-0 on the opening day and would stay there until close to the end of March. In the bag.",
      "Except that having been dodgy as owt going into Christmas, a Manchester United inspired by Eric Cantona’s return from his fan-kicky suspension were virtually flawless after opening their stockings (leave it), winning all but four of their games – starting with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle themselves.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, were very, very flawed, with Faustino Asprilla’s mid-season arrival bringing yet more flair to an already attacking side but leading Kevin Keegan to disastrously change shape to fit him in, while new midfield arrival David Batty failed to help matters.",
      "That famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield in early April was Newcastle’s fourth defeat in six games, and the upturn in their form that followed was too late: Manchester United had overtaken them, and made sure the title was sealed on points rather than goal difference by winning their final two games while Newcastle were only able to draw theirs."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that Joshua Zirkzee would be more likely to leave Man Utd if they signed Semenyo or another attacker.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “We will see what happens with Semenyo, and this, guys, remember this point, could be an important deal to understand what happens with Joshua Zirkzee.”",
      "Romano continued: “Last week a meeting took place between Roma and the agents of Joshua Zirkzee. This week, Roma have been advancing in the conversations with the camp of Zirkzee.",
      "“Roma are pushing, they want the player and consider him a top priority. The manager of Roma, Gian Piero Gasperini, is pushing to have the player as soon as possible at the beginning of January.",
      "“Man Utd don’t want Zirkzee to leave at the beginning of January because they are short of options with Amad [Diallo] and [Bryan] Mbeumo at AFCON, Bruno [Fernandes] now injured, [Kobbie] Mainoo at the moment still not available.",

      "And now Dutch outlet Voetbal International insists that Roma ‘goes all out’ for Zirkzee in January and the Serie A side ‘want to move quickly’.",
      "The Italian outfit ‘intend to loan Zirkzee for six months, with a mandatory purchase option’ but a quick deal is not guaranteed with Man Utd suffering from injuries to key players and Africa Cup of Nations absentees.",
      "For Zirkzee it’s ‘crucial that he plays plenty of minutes in the next six months’ as he looks to get into the Netherlands squad for the World Cup in North America in the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘Zirkzee has had positive talks with Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini and is enthusiastic about the plans, but the final say lies with Manchester United. It seems the payment structure still needs to be finalized. The player himself has reached an agreement.’",

      "Manchester United often don’t even bother with the January transfer window, perhaps scarred by the memory of their worst signing of the post-Ferguson era. But it also prompted their very best…",
      "United are reported to be in the market for January recruits, though they appear to have missed out on Antoine Semenyo.",
      "If they sign another forward before midfielder, frankly, the club should be folded. But reports suggest they could also be in the market for Ruben Neves. Which, unless he leaves his legs in Saudi, seems like a good idea.",
      "As did most of these January signings. Even this fella at no.10…",
      "",
      "Rated on these pages as the worst of all the post-Fergie signings, which is really quite an achievement when you consider your Di Marias, your Sanchos, your Pogbas. But Sanchez admitted he wanted to quit United and return to Arsenal after only his first training session. Sadly for him and United, there was no return policy on the £35million swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join the Gunners.",
      "Then the highest-paid player ever in the Premier League, Sanchez stuck it out for 32 league appearances, scoring three goals while barely hiding his contempt for his surroundings.",
      "In fairness to United, no one saw it going this badly wrong when he was tinkling the ivories for his unveiling video. In Sanchez, they had signed one of the Premier League’s best players. But, even by United standards, the immediate slump in the Chilean’s output once he walked through the Old Trafford door was damning on all concerned. In the end, they had to pay him millions just to f*** off, which was far better value than the millions they paid him to play.",
      "",
      "At Barcelona, Valdes won everything in one of the greatest teams of all time. So it was quite striking to see him as barely a bit-part at United after he signed for 18 months as a freebie for Louis van Gaal in January 2015.",
      "Valdes played two games for United, serving as understudy to compatriot David De Gea before p*ssing off Van Gaal to the extent he wasn’t allowed to train even with the youth team or allowed a locker for his Rolex while he worked out alone with an academy goalkeeping coach.",
      "",
      "Arriving on loan from Palace in January 2023, ex-England stopper Butland was just one of a few odd goalkeeper signings made by United, replacing another in Martin Dubravka. At least Dubravka got his gloves dirty twice. Butland never made it off the bench for the club he supported as a boy, even if he took an FA Cup runners-up medal back to Palace with him.",
      "",
      "The Netherlands international is widely derided on the basis that he failed to score a Premier League goal in his half-season at Old Trafford. Which isn’t a good look for a centre-forward.",
      "But after a loan switch from Burnley, with the Clarets splitting £3million with Besiktas, Weghorst endeared himself to the United faithful just by running around a bit and showing an appetite to be there. That’s how low the bar was for a fanbase fed up of watching Anthony Martial’s mard-arse saunter around Old Trafford.",
      "He scored two cup goals, won the Carabao Cup and generally seemed to relish his big opportunity. But, enthusiastic though he was, he was never likely to be the top-class striker Erik ten Hag needed.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag had to hurriedly spin through his Rolodex during the final days of the January 2023 transfer window as soon as it emerged that Christian Eriksen would be out for three months after bumping into Andy Carroll in a bad mood.",
      "As the first Austrian to play for United, Sabitzer scored three goals in 18 appearances and had a hand in the Carabao Cup triumph by coming off the bench in the final against Newcastle. When his loan was up, everyone concerned seemed pretty non-plussed about the prospect of making it a longer-term arrangement. He did okay but his impact was negligible.",
      "In the end, Sabitzer returned to Bayern Munich before being sold to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "",
      "United’s move for Ighalo in January 2020 sparked a new genre of transfer: an Ighalo-type move, one defined as late, desperate and short-term. See: Weghorst.",
      "In that sense, Ighalo served his purpose. Arriving from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, he bagged five goals in 19 appearances in the Covid season to earn a six-month extension before heading off to Al Shabab to complete the lucrative CSL-Pro League double bubble.",
      "MORE FROM F365: Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle among top 10 storylines we weren’t expecting in 2025",
      "The jury is still out on Dorgu but a year on from his arrival from Lecce, a verdict is surely imminent. Frankly, though, it doesn’t look encouraging. And the slim possibility that he might yet come good means he ranks higher than his performances so far merit.",
      "The Denmark international is still only 21 with less senior experience than many peers of a similar age so it was unfair to expect him to hit the ground running. But it is hard to identify many redeeming features in the left wing-back. He’s quick, sure. But can you recall him giving many opposition full-backs a hard time? There is certainly little encouragement to be found in a record of no goals and three assists in 37 appearances. Dorgu was Amorim’s first signing but wing-backs on both sides are among the areas United are still considered weakest.",
      "",
      "The spectacle of club-record signing Mata being choppered into Carrington to join United in January 2014 summed up the post-Fergie United. Or rather the post-David Gill United. The Woodward United.",
      "Not that any of that was Mata’s fault. And for much of his career at United, the former Spain playmaker was a pleasure to watch. Never more than in March 2015 at Juanfield. And the fact he’s a good egg did him no harm, even if he rarely dragged United to new heights as one might expect of a creative record signing.",
      "Mata spent seven and a half years at Old Trafford, scoring 51 goals in 285 appearances, winning four trophies. Never the big ones, but United haven’t been in a position to be sniffy about silverware.",
      "The Diallo deal was arranged in October 2020 to be completed the following January. And for a while, it looked like more money down the drain when the winger struggled to make a first-team breakthrough. A loan move to Sunderland went much better than an earlier stint at Rangers and eventually, three years after he joined, Amad began to get some regular minutes in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ten Hag was binned, Amad was expected to be one of the players to profit from Amorim’s appointment and the sudden need for wing-backs. Indeed, were it not for an ankle injury last season, he would be in the top three players with most minutes under Amorim. Amad can play as wing-back or as one of the wide forwards. He probably prefers the latter but is needed more as the former.",
      "",
      "Quite simply the best signing of the post-Fergie era, be it the summer or winter window.",
      "Fernandes has been the single consistent bright spot on a rather bleak landscape since he arrived from Sporting Lisbon pre-Covid in 2020. Immediately dismiss the opinion of anyone who pushes the claim that Fernandes has been ‘a problem’, or indeed anything but the best, most creative signing of the last dozen years. Imagine how bad United would have been without him.",
      "Alexander Isak has *finally* broken his silence on his injury four days ago, but Liverpool need not worry because a perfect replacement has been identified.",
      "There is anger at the notion that Alexander Isak’s leg break was karma and not a lot else in the pre-Christmas Mailbox.",
      "Liverpool’s frustration at Alexander Isak’s injury is obvious and understandable, but there is no villain in this story and no justice to be served.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Liverpool reportedly have an agreement with Marc Guehi but waiting for the Crystal Palace player could have costly ramifications.",
      "We certainly didn’t expect everything that football has thrown at us in 2025, but there has been enough entirely predictable stuff to keep us sane."

      "The newspaper added: ‘The 31-year-old is due to be sidelined for United’s upcoming home games against Newcastle and Wolves, the New Year trips to Leeds and Burnley, the FA Cup third round visit of Brighton and the Old Trafford derby on January 17.",

      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer insists the fact Man Utd are losing Fernandes for a period of matches at the same time that Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui to Africa Cup of Nations duty “will hurt” Amorim’s side.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: “Losing Bruno Fernandes at any time would be bad but losing him when you’re already missing three players in Mazraoui, Diallo, and Mbeumo will hurt Man United.",
      "“He’s been the one constant through all their troubles, the one pulling them through games at times. There’s no doubt they’ll miss him massively. He very rarely gets injured, so he’ll be a big miss.",
      "“Performance-wise, I thought Man United did alright against Villa, but the result was decided by Morgan Rogers. With injuries and people away, Newcastle are the same.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "The Red Devils paid out around £74m to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man Utd spent almost all of their budget on attacking players with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also joining, while Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were the other summer arrivals.",
      "Sesko has struggled to adapt to the Premier League and playing for Man Utd, with the Slovenia international contributing two goals and one assist in 14 matches in all competitions.",
      "And Parker wonders whether Man Utd ever sent any scouts to go and watch Sesko as they are failing to play to the 22-year-old’s strengths.",
      "The former Man Utd defender exclusively told Football365 in association with gambling portal British Gambler: “You look at Benjamin Sesko and the goals he’s scored, it makes me wonder whether Manchester United sent anyone to actually watch him play. When he was at Leipzig, there were lots of balls coming into the box and those big-angle passes being hit at him from deep for him to run onto.",
      "READ: Arsenal top, Tottenham freakout, assorted flops – 10 of the 2025 storylines we DID see coming",
      "“He was scoring all kinds of goals there, and at United they’re feeding him breadcrumbs. The players behind him aren’t giving him opportunities so he’s having to do a lot of the work himself which is of course expected, you have to give a little bit back sometimes.",
      "“That was Rasmus Hojlund’s issue, too. He struggled in the Premier League because he wasn’t fed enough, but also agility-wise and quickness of feet, they were reasons he struggled, too. That’s why he’s been given the opportunity to flourish in the Serie A because the pace of that league is no where near the speed of the Premier League.”",
      "It’s unlikely that England will take many Man Utd players to the World Cup but Parker has addressed the media narrative surrounding former Old Trafford transfer target Jude Bellingham, who now stars for Real Madrid and the Three Lions.",
      "Parker added: “If you’re going on current form, Morgan Rogers should be starting ahead of Jude Bellingham for England next summer at the World Cup. When you play with England you try and make everything as close to a club’s scenario as possible.",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Bruno Fernandes limp exclusive as Antoine Semenyo decision YESTERDAY",
      "“The issue is that the media have been so pivotal in driving Bellingham’s narrative. The media have been pushing Bellingham since the Euros to make it all about him. When you look at Rogers, he’s that one player in the team who’s allowed to go wherever he wants, he often comes in from the left-hand side to score goals.",
      "“I love what Rogers is doing for Villa but also what Eberechi Eze did for Crystal Palace when he played a similar role. Eze was outstanding at that time and I think he was the best in the Premier League in that position last season.",
      "“I think that freedom has been taken away from him by Mikel Arteta since going to Arsenal. They bought him for what he was delivering and then when they got him, they’ve tried to get him to do something different. It doesn’t make sense for that kind of money.",
      "“Cole Palmer is another vying for that role and he’s good in the big games. He’s proven that for club and country already. It’s about him getting the games back under his belt after his injury, but for me he’s the most standout player. He plays off the cuff, not that Rogers and Eze don’t, but Palmer stands out the most, the issue is there that he’s got a manager who’s still trying to school him.”",

      "But that’s all irrelevant: they won a trophy. We can’t all be sat here telling them for years and years and years that they needed to stop f*cking about and win a trophy and then go ‘No, not like that’ when they actually do it. Fair’s fair.",
      "So yes, we were surprised by that. We have been surprised by absolutely nothing they have done since, though. An even halfway-sensible club of Tottenham’s size would have recognised the enormous potential of the launchpad it provided. A real chance to be the start of something.",

As small-time as Nuno; as defensively naïve as Postecoglou; as attackingly bereft as Mourinho; as full of undisguised loathing for the club and its fans as Conte.",

Nobody knows what the plan is. Nobody knows who to pin it on now it’s all going wrong, if indeed it is actually going wrong, which nobody knows for sure because of the aforementioned lack of plan.",

They don’t seem to know what to do about the failing manager, or just as importantly who should do it, or, again, if it actually needs doing. What does success or failure here even look like now?",

      "There is no shame in being a selling club, a trading club. Everyone has their place in the food chain. But you cannot just let the quality of the playing squad be denuded to this extent without apparently even trying to source the next rough diamonds that will keep the plates spinning.",

      "We didn’t ever buy into the New Era of Liverpool Dominance theory. We didn’t think Pep Guardiola’s Man City Mk II would yet be ready to dominate English football again.",
      "Therefore it stands to reason that Arsenal – even with Floppy McFlopface up front – would be leading the Premier League when the Christmas presents were being opened.",
      "And really this should be a surprise to nobody. It is a position that Arsenal have now occupied on three of the last four Christmas Days. The problem is that we all know what generally happens next.",
      "But having based our thinking up to this point on such solid historical data, we’re now going to say tits to all that. Because this time they’re actually going to do it. They’re actually going to win the league. Probably.",

On that basis, Erling Haaland is pretty, pretty, pretty great after his disastrous and miserable 24/25 season saw him finish with a mortifying return of just 22 Premier League goals.",

      "It was always likely he’d put that right, and he’s almost secured this season’s Golden Boot already. If he can score three goals in the next two games, he’ll have already matched last year’s 22-goal tally at the halfway stage.",
      "His lead over his nearest challenger Igor Thiago is already eight goals, and nobody else is even within 10. It’s already shaping up as, Haaland apart, a curious kind of year where goals are being shared about by everyone rather than Your Salahs or Your Isaks dominating a team’s scoring charts.",
      "There’s a fair chance that Haaland could miss the rest of the season and still have already done enough.",

      "Last December, Chelsea had put themselves right in the title picture with a fine run of form, but Enzo Maresca wasn’t having any of it. “Little old us?” he said (we’re paraphrasing), “Winning the league? Cor blimey, no, what a silly thing to say. We are but a tiny little David attempting to compete with veritable Goliaths, our only weapon a tiny catapult costing hundreds of millions of dollars and fashioned only from the most basic raw materials of loads of brilliant footballers, some eight-year contracts and clubs around the world where we can park them for a bit with no regard for either player or that club as long as it keeps the tills ringing at HQ.”",

He was only able to sacrifice the league campaign because it had already gone really badly wrong before the Europa League got down to brass tacks, and because there were three teams sufficiently abysmal that Spurs had the luxury of calling time on their league campaign after a trio of wins in February took them to the dizzy heights of 33 points from 26 games.",
      "Point here being: that’s still crap. In any normal season, that is not entirely-out-of-the-woods safe. The fact it’s very possibly more points than Spurs will have after 26 games of this season is simply funny, but doesn’t really help Postecoglou.",
      "But the lure and appeal of Postecoglou is obvious. There is a lot to like. But he had been thoroughly rumbled as a Premier League manager.",
      "We knew, though, that someone would be unable to resist. And we knew their regret would be instant and palpable.",
      "We didn’t know it would be Nottingham Forest, but it was as good a shout as any in hindsight. A trigger-happy chairman and a misplaced sense of importance after one half-decent season were a potent combination for being the club to fall into the trap.",

      "You really don’t at this time want to be the other club in any sentence that includes the words ‘…and Tottenham’ but that’s where Brighton are with regard to failing to beat Wolves, and we’re only giving them a partial pass for the reason they have been unable to beat Burnley thus far is that they haven’t actually played them.",

      "",
      "While many clubs seek to further erode the power of the head coach, Villa have allowed Emery to build the structure he wants. Rather than him reporting to a sporting director, especially now Monchi has departed, Emery has hand-picked the people he wants around him. Only the owners hold more power than the manager and no one can say he hasn’t earned it.",

      "Bournemouth cashed in on plenty of talent in the summer, especially across their defence. But early on they made clear that Antoine Semenyo would not be sold. Certainly not until January, and only then for a decent fee with plenty of time to source a replacement. The forward’s importance is evident in the fact that as soon as his fine form dipped, Bournemouth went winless. Presumably, there is a list of replacements lined up should United, City or Liverpool cough up the £65million required in a timely fashion.",

      "Admittedly, most of us thought Brentford had f***ed it this summer. They lost the manager who got them into the Premier League and established there before appointing a rookie boss while selling many of their best players. But the Bees know what they are doing. Despite the upheaval, Brentford are exactly where they were at the same point last season, cosy in 12th with 23 points from 56 games, eyeing the top-half finish they achieved last term.",
      "",
      "A triple substitution is generally damning enough for the team concerned, but the lesser-spotted quadruple change is effectively the manager ripping to shreds his own plan and his players’ performances. Which was Fabian Hurzerler’s intention when four numbers went up around the hour mark when Brighton were losing and toiling against Manchester City on the last day of August.",
      "James Milner, Yasin Ayari, Georginio Rutter and Brajan Gruda entered the play and while Brighton’s shape remained roughly the same, they suddenly became much more troublesome for City, who went from dealing easily with their hosts’ direct approach to creaking underneath it. Milner levelled shortly after coming on before Gruda won it late on for Brighton’s only win in their first five.",
      "“Sometimes in football it’s not about tactics, it’s about understanding the profiles from the players,” Hurzeler said after. “It’s about understanding what you need, and in this moment we needed energy, intensity, and the belief to change the game.”",

      "Burnley’s promotion was based on a defence that broke multiple records and, behind that, a goalkeeper who conceded a stunning 12.7 goals fewer than xG reckons he ought to have. So losing Trafford was always going to leave huge gloves to fill, which Martin Dubravka has done. No keeper has faced more shots and none has made more saves. Dubravka was part of what looked like a savvy summer of recruitment that left Scott Parker with a balanced squad better prepared to take on the Premier League than 2023/24. But it’s still not likely to be enough.",

It may have been a nonsense tournament, but winning it in the manner they did, blowing away arguably the best team in Europe, earned Maresca some major credit with the fans and owners, quietening briefly the doubters that remained despite Chelsea qualifying for the Champions League for the first time under Clearlake’s stewardship.",

I knew I’d save it.” Which he did, and Palace won their first major trophy, catapulting them into Europe.",

Which prompted the Toffees to ditch Sean Dyche in early January and rather than appoint a progressive new coach – always a temptation for new owners – they went for the tried and tested method in Moyes.",
      "“This club felt to me like one big family, but looked broken, felt broken and it doesn’t feel like that any more,”  summed up the manager at the end of the season, with safety comfortably achieved just as the Goodison lights were to be turned off for the last time. From there, TFG invested the ninth-highest net-spend of the summer to give Evertonians a team to get excited about in a stunning new gaff.

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says it is \"impossible\" to replace Bruno Fernandes as the captain faces a spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.",
      "Amorim is hoping Fernandes' absence will give other players the chance to step up and lead the team, as well as take up his position in midfield.",
      "\"It's impossible to replace Bruno,\" the head coach said in his pre-match press conference. \"But I said that this morning to the team, we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, and a lot of people need to step up.",
      "\"It's not just the creation. On every set-piece, he is the guy organising the team and that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up and realise we can't rely on one player for everything.",
      "\"Sometimes we rely on Bruno for the organisation and creation. We lost Bruno, Bryan [Mbeumo] and Amad in set pieces so this is massive for the team.",
      "\"This is a good chance for Lucha [Lisandro Martinez], Luke Shaw, all of these guys to step up and have more leaders in the group.\"",
      "On who might come in for Fernandes in Man Utd's midfield, Amorim added: \"We have other players. We maybe need to see different ways of playing.",
      "\"I think Jack Fletcher did a very good job [against Aston Villa] and that's why when we have this opportunity, we need to give space to guys like Jack and others. We will find solutions to play.",
      "\"I am confident we can win any game. We have some problems, but I believe in the team, even without many players in this moment. It is more difficult, but I trust in my players. If we are really focused in the game, we can win.\"",
      "Amorim's comments on Fernandes come almost a week after the midfielder claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy the head coach.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "He said: \"I would love to go back to the last year. We suffer a lot in this moment and I would do things so differently.",
      "\"I learned more this year than the other five as a manager. I will do so many things in a different way, not just in everything but also on the pitch, the way we play the game.",
      "\"No matter what happens in the future, I learned so much and I'm a different manager.",
      "\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing, but to take all the value of the squad that I had last year, maybe it was not the right choices all the time. I watched the games from last season to understand different things.",
      "\"I'm a different manager today. I will do maybe 75 per cent of the things different, but the key things, the red lines would be the same. I think I'm a better manager now.\"",

      "By Callum Bishop, Adam Bate, Noah Langford, Sam Cohen",
      "Wednesday 24 December 2025 14:36, UK",
      "For the first time since he joined in 2020, Manchester United face the prospect of losing the talismanic Bruno Fernandes through injury for a sustained period of time.",
      "Fernandes was replaced at half-time during the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa after suddenly pulling up late in the first-half. United boss Ruben Amorim clarified after the game that his captain had suffered soft tissue damage and that he would miss 'some games.'",
      "It's a bitter blow for the Red Devils ahead of a busy period that could define their season. Every statistic under the sun shows just how valuable the 31-year-old is at Old Trafford.",
      "Most, if not all Manchester United fans will be thinking that this is the opportunity for Kobbie Mainoo to prove his worth to Ruben Amorim.",
      "From scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final and representing England at that year's European Championships, the midfielder finds himself without a Premier League start this season.",
      "It has led to speculation that he could depart the Theatre of Dreams, on loan or permanently, as frustration over game time grows.",
      "Unexpectedly, the door has now opened. With Fernandes out, there is no chance Amorim lets Mainoo go in January. And having insisted that the club captain is who the academy graduate is competing with for a place in the team, it seems only logical that he will finally be handed his opportunity.",
      "That won't be against Newcastle though, as Amorim confirmed he will likely miss out with a calf injury that also saw him left out of the squad against Villa. He'll be hoping one of the other alternative options doesn't lay claim to the spot before he even has a chance to.Callum Bishop",
      "Mason Mount has started Manchester United's last three Premier League games. Into his third season as a United player, this is only the second time that he has been on such a run, previously starting four in a row at the back end of last season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's absence has opened up a slot for him tucked in off the right but Mount has had plenty of Premier League minutes in a deeper role and could prove a good foil alongside the far less mobile Casemiro. He would appear an able deputy for Fernandes.",
      "Of course, shifting him from the forward line, particularly with Mbeumo and Amad Diallo away, would only present Amorim with another challenge and it may be that Mount's pressing higher up the pitch is deemed a more important asset to the United coach.Adam Bate",
      "\"In the first half they were by far the better team and surprisingly, I thought with Martinez in midfield in the second half, they were the equal of [Aston] Villa as a minimum.\"",
      "Those were Gary Neville's words as Lisandro Martinez was brought on at the break to replace the injured Fernandes at Villa Park.",
      "Martinez is primarily a centre-back, but has shown he can step into midfield when required. The Argentine is not unfamiliar with that position. During his time at Ajax, he was at times utilised in the middle of the park.",
      "In his 22 games as a stereotypical number six, he averaged close to 66 passes per 90 minutes with an accuracy above 86 per cent, ranked highly for final-third passes among others in those games, and still contributed defensively with solid numbers for tackles, interceptions and possessions won in the middle third.",
      "Martinez would not offer the same creativity as Fernandes, but his ability to recycle possession, read the game and maintain structure could provide a different type of balance in midfield. With fixtures coming thick and fast, his versatility gives Amorim another internal option to consider while United’s captain remains unavailable.Sam Cohen",
      "With Casemiro suspended against Aston Villa, it was left to Manuel Ugarte to try and slot in next to Fernandes, though he did little to rubber stamp his credentials.",
      "Ugarte once again failed to impress. He was lacklustre with and without the ball - he didn’t create any big chances or manage a single shot on target, whilst also losing the most aerial duels of any player in the game.",
      "Defeat on Sunday means that the Uruguayan has lost all seven of his last seven starts. To boot, an eighth loss in nine marks the longest run without a Premier League victory for a starting Man Utd player for over two decades. Only Kleberson, between January 2004 and May 2005, managed a longer winless run in a red shirt.",
      "Ugarte’s hefty £50.7m price tag has come into question frequently during his tenure in Manchester, especially given the recent success of his predecessor, Scott McTominay. The Scotsman was allowed to leave United for £26m - only half of the outlay for Ugarte.",
      "Just this weekend, McTominay won the Italian Supercoppa, his second piece of silverware since moving to Italy, off the back of being named Serie A Player of the Year last month.",
      "He likely would’ve been an ideal solution. But the man who essentially took his place in the squad has done little to silence the doubters.Noah Langford",
      "There was something noticably different about the way United set up against Aston Villa. As opposed to leading with a pressing front three and double pivot behind, Amorim opted to defensively lead with a front two and a triangle three propping up behind, including Fernandes, Mount and Ugarte.",
      "Assuming Casemiro would return in place of the latter, this could be something Amorim turns to more often. Mount or Mainoo could slot into the Fernandes role, with the other remaining further up the pitch.",
      "Should Bryan Mbeumo return from AFCON before Fernandes is fit to return, perhaps he links up with Matheus Cunha up top while Benjamin Sesko takes up an impact substitute role as he continues his adaptation to the Premier League.",
      "This would still give Mount the chance to take up an important position in the team given his growing influence on the side of late.Callum Bishop",
      "We'd be remissed not to touch upon the fact that there could be a surprise inclusion for one of United's youngsters to step into the team with Fernandes out.",
      "Jack Fletcher, son of former Red Devil and current lead coach of the club's under-18s side Darren, made his senior debut off the bench at Villa Park and has been touted as a potential star of the future. His twin brother, Tyler, also plays as a midfielder and may see a chance for himself.",
      "Eighteen-year-old Jim Thwaites has also been earning praise for his development, while Sekou Kone has had experienced training with the first-team before. Although, recent fitness struggles may set back any hopes he has of a sniff.",
      "Amorim has not long spoken about the entitlement of some of his youngsters, but now he may have to rely on them more than previously.Callum Bishop",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "These are his words as he remembers his dad, reflects on managing the feeling of loss and after previous loan spells, considers what's next in his footballing journey.",
      "To be honest, being truthful, the first two, three days… I'm not really an emotional person to be honest, but they are the worst feelings I've ever had in my life.",
      "Then a week passes, two weeks pass, and you look at it like: I can never feel that bad again. I can never feel like I did that day when I found out.",
      "So everything from there is just like, say that's down there, well, even if you might be here, at least you're not down there. So then it gives you that reason to go, 'no, no, this can't get the better of me'.",
      "It just gives you more of a purpose and a focus that you can overcome it, because you've overcome this and you've come out the other end.",
      "You accept that some days you're going to think about it.",
      "I think to be honest, considering the circumstances, I'm doing okay. I'm cracking on.",
      "I have a lot of positive distractions, not that I disregard it but I've got a lot of purpose in my life and I'm lucky to be in the situation that I'm in.",
      "I'm lucky to have the family around me that I do. It's such a cliché thing to say, but I would not be where I am today without him and my family.",
      "It's impossible at six, seven, eight years old to drive yourself to training or make certain times and stuff like that. You have to rely on them to get you through that part.",
      "When you're young, all you want to do is get old. You get to 18 and all you want to do is drive and then you want to do this and that.",
      "I've said it before but you have such a different outlook on life when things like this have happened because there's nothing that can prepare you for it.",
      "But you become more grateful and you become more humble, and stuff that you might have looked down your nose at and thought that's just part of everyday life, it kind of rises up to your eye level and you think you've got to be grateful for what you have.",
      "It has given me a different perspective, but it's making a situation that is really tough and taking as many positives out of it as I can.",
      "Otherwise you can't live the rest of your life being negative and so upset about it.",
      "You have to try and be positive and you have to try and give yourself a purpose and a reason to get up every day. To work hard, achieve your dreams and goals that he would want you to do if he was still here.",
      "You've just got to crack on.",
      "I think for me, you look at it and you look at the effect that it has on other people, but then you also look at how much people appreciate that person who isn't there.",
      "That is the simple fact where people don't realise how appreciated they are and they don't realise what they do for others and this is the thing, we do take it for granted.",
      "Even if someone's having the best time of their life and everything's going well and they might have a business and it's doing really well, whatever it might be, it's still checking in on them because you don't want it to just become a point where it's like, only when things are going wrong, 'are you okay?'",
      "You could be having the best time ever, whatever situation it might be, just speaking about it is so powerful.",
      "You don't realise just having a conversation about how you feel and not having that stigma around it especially with men.",
      "I've been in a football environment since I was six years old, I've been here since I was eight years old and it's like you try and put on this brave face and you think that you can't talk about how you might be feeling but it's so important, it is so important that you talk about in any walk of life, any workplace, whatever it might be, talking about how you feel, there's never a problem with that.",
      "I know it will 100 per cent feel like such a big thing and it'd be so difficult to talk and you feel like it's also that feeling of being past help but you're never ever past help like if you reach out… there isn't an age limit on when you can speak up or go to therapy or, you know, make a situation better.",
      "There is no age limit, there is no time limit, there is nobody who could speak to me about how they were feeling and I'd shut it down or I'd disregard it.",
      "Like just speaking up and it could honestly be a two-minute conversation but you don't realise like how much that might help you.",
      "My dad wouldn't have known how much he was loved and cared for. I had messages from people... he was working at a tyre place changing tyres, people who've met him once saying 'oh, such a lovely man,' so on and so forth. You don't realise you have people that you meet once or people that you meet a million times...",
      "You know, just speaking about how you feel, you know, there's never, and definitely in my case, there would never be a time that I would shut that down.",
      "The club have been amazing since I've come back in.",
      "It's one of them, I was back in a week after because I think this is my passion and it's a positive distraction, it's what I enjoy doing but if I needed to take a month, two months, whatever it might be, there wouldn't have been a problem.",
      "I've been here for so long, it's like my family and at times you see people at football more than you see your family at home and you're so close to them.",
      "It was whatever you need to do, however it's going to look for you, it can look like that and I'm so appreciative for that because like I said there was no pressure on getting back in or having to meet this date or this time, it was whatever you feel like and even if you come back in and you're not feeling great, dip back out if you need to.",
      "I haven't because I love my job, it's a job at the end of the day but it's what you've worked so hard for being a young kid that you can make this your work and I love playing football. And obviously at the minute, you know, I'm injured and that and it is difficult but then it's looking at other ways you can spend your time and positive distractions.",
      "To be honest I've picked up the DJing, so I'm just giving that a go now but yeah because I can't play padel and stuff (because of his injury).",
      "You look at things with a bit of a different perspective on life…football isn't my whole identity as much as you love it so much, it's kind of broadening those horizons and trying to trying to fulfil your life in other ways where I'm not just reliant on if I'm fit and not injured because then, when I do get injured, mentally you can take a bit of a dip because you're so caught up on needing to get back. And so, just broadening those horizons is what I've been trying to do, to be honest.",
      "Hopefully I'll get back from the injury I've got and get out on loan in January.",
      "But I think the thing for me it's about going forward… there's always going to be a piece of you missing. Anybody who's gone through this will know there'll always be a piece of you missing but you learn to just carry on because you have to.",
      "What I'm saying is just because six months have passed, we're still going to talk about our feelings and not act like that's done and that's behind us. There's never any time limit on it.",

      "\"Over the next few days, especially in light of Isak's injury, there will be discussions over whether they make a late move for Semenyo.\"",
      "Kaveh Solhekol:",
      "\"If I'm Antoine Semenyo. I'm looking at that Man City squad and thinking, dream come true to sign for Man City. On the other hand, how much game time am I going to get if I move there?",
      "\"I'm not really sure there is a desperate need for them to spend money in January.",
      "\"Another interesting subplot is Pep Guardiola's future. He signed a new contract that takes him to the summer of 2027, but there is talks already that he might call it a day this summer.",
      "\"What impact could that have on Manchester City's transfer plans? As much as we say clubs buy players, Guardiola has been there for so long that he will have a say in which players come to the club.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has consistently said that the club will make moves in the January transfer window provided it is in the long-term interest of Manchester United.",
      "\"They have kept a keen eye on Semenyo's development. That interest goes further back than the summer transfer window.",
      "\"Semenyo signed a new contract in the summer that included a release clause of £65m. That release clause is only valid in the first half of January. That's because if someone triggers the release clause, Bournemouth want time to find a replacement.",
      "\"There is then a lower release clause in the summer transfer window. Expect some sort of movement in the first half of this transfer window.",
      "\"The interesting thing with Semenyo is if United were to sign him, where Amorim would want to play him.",
      "\"Is he going to take over from either of Cunha or Mbeumo? It's very unlikely. Is it the left-wing back position that Amorim has cited Semenyo? And would Semenyo be happy playing in that position?\"",
      "\"One thing for certain now, Mo Salah will be staying at the club. There's a good chance Harvey Elliott would come back from Aston Villa as well.",
      "\"Whether Liverpool go for a striker or another attacking player like Semenyo, who Liverpool have been heavily linked with as well, we all know he's got a buyout clause in January.",
      "\"Then you've got wide players, as in Salah and Gakpo, who've played a lot of games through the middle as well. You've got young Jayden Danns.",
      "\"That's the way they could go around it because I don't think Liverpool, when you go back a few years when they had a real problem at centre-back, they didn't go and spend big money on someone they didn't want.",
      "\"They won't go out and buy a striker who they don't really want. If they do want Semenyo, that's probably a good way around it.\"",
      "Liverpool - there are two sides to this particular route: short-term and long-term.",
      "Semenyo would be an excellent addition for Liverpool right now, with injuries to Isak and Gakpo - plus Salah's departure to AFCON - leaving Arne Slot's side short in attack for the coming weeks.",
      "That's the short-term, but the long-term vision of Semenyo at Anfield is more complicated. Should Salah leave, then Semenyo could be deemed the natural heir to the Egyptian's role at Anfield.",
      "But what happens if Salah and Slot put their issues aside and the former returns to form? Then once Gakpo and Isak return from injury, where would Semenyo fit in with Hugo Ekitike as well?",
      "Man City - this would be another interesting question regarding squad competition. With everyone fit, would Semenyo get into Man City team right now?",
      "Guardiola has finally managed to settle his squad with Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku acting as the perfect trio behind Erling Haaland.",
      "However, there is a argument that squad depth is still an issue. The recent 2-0 loss to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League showed how the floor of City's squad could do with a lift - and Semenyo could help that.",
      "Man Utd - Amorim spent around £200m on bringing in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha over the summer, and now he wants to add more attacking quality to his ranks?",
      "Perhaps a potential January departure for Joshua Zirkzee could open up a spot in the United squad for Semenyo to fill?",
      "One area Semenyo could play is at wing-back, especially with his qualities out wide. But could he play there with Amad Diallo on the other flank? Would that be too attacking?",
      "Bournemouth - Another possibility for Semenyo could be to stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the season, especially if his desired team stalls this month.",
      "But the Cherries are a long way off being the European contenders they were last season. With Andoni Iraola's future never certain and Bournemouth's form needing to pick up, there are a few dominoes needing to fall at the south coast.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less than convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliot's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's future will dominate at least the first part of Bournemouth's window and is something that could be concluded quickly. His £65m release clause is straightforward but not active for the entire window, in part to protect Bournemouth from being left short of a replacement on February 1.",
      "They want to bring in a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone given Semenyo almost left in the summer. Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, goalkeeper is a position Bournemouth are looking to recruit in again to find someone that can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez Liverpool. There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Spurs and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing the player in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Captain Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer - but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Man City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right wing-back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds United are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlwo, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window even after spending £200m+ net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah firmly put his future on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad - but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City have emerged as the frontrunners in the race for Antoine Semenyo in January but both Liverpool and Manchester United remain interested.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting on, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires the club to be careful but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "At the time of writing, Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are out injured and if they lose anyone else then Newcastle will be in big bother. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",

      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",

      "Gary Neville on Ruben Amorim's change in Man Utd approach: \"I'm happy he's adapting... he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton. That would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job\"",
      "Monday 22 December 2025 06:11, UK",
      "Gary Neville feels Ruben Amorim has given himself a blueprint to move forward after a notable change in style this week - but Roy Keane remains unimpressed with \"one of the worst teams in the league\" without the ball.",
      "For the first time in his tenure, Amorim has visibly moved away from the rigid 3-4-2-1 formation he had previously stuck with both at Old Trafford and across his managerial career, displaying a level of flexibility which had previously become a bone of contention for Manchester United supporters.",
      "After deploying a hybrid back four in Monday's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth, United put on another improved display despite losing 2-1 to in-form Aston Villa at Villa Park and deserved more than they got for the second game in succession.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville said: \"I thought it was a really good performance, but the details of the two goals have cost them.",
      "\"Now that's going to continue to happen whilst they don't have the likes of Harry Maguire and Matthijs De Ligt, and they don't have players that would make them a lot stronger.",
      "\"What I have seen in these last two games is a couple of things. One, the manager has changed. Quite obviously, the system that he said he would never change, the five or the three [at the back], the two in midfield, the two wing backs and the three up front, that has been thrown out of the window in the last two matches. That's a good thing.",
      "\"I'm happy that the manager is adapting to what's happening out there because of what's happening with AFCON, but also I think there's an element where he couldn't carry on as we saw against West Ham and Everton at home.",
      "\"More of that would find the manager in a lot of trouble - more of what we've seen between Bournemouth and Villa is going to find the manager in a job, and will allow him to build something, because you can build off what you've seen here.",
      "\"Manchester United can still finish in the top five and they've missed three or four opportunities in the last three weeks to do that, but if they can get those players back from AFCON and they can stay fit, they can do something.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has got to approach it the way in which he has in the last five or six days. The system has been tweaked - more than tweaked - and I think with [Mason] Mount, [Matheus] Cunha, [Bruno] Fernandes, [Bejamin] Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and Amad [Diallo] out there on the pitch, not all of them but probably four or five of them, they will cause a lot of teams a lot of problems.\"",
      "Keane was similarly impressed with Man Utd's attacking output, with Amorim's side only outscored by Manchester City this season, but felt that was little excuse for the ease with which they were cut apart for both of Morgan Rogers' fine strikes in their latest defeat - their fifth from 17 league games.",
      "Leny Yoro was singled out for criticism for a lack of intensity in closing down Rogers when he first received the ball before cutting inside and netting a stunning opener, while Keane was just as frustrated by Diogo Dalot's attempts to block a cross leading up to his second.",
      "\"You can have all the talent in the world, but you have to roll your sleeves up and when the game gets a bit tight you say you're going to do your bit for the team,\" he said on Super Sunday. \"This isn't a tricky winger, it's just a little shimmy. He's like yeah, have a cross. This ends up being the winning goal.",
      "\"It's not like someone's done a brilliant trick or run at him with real pace. You get down low, you get your body in position. You say if you're going to get a cross in, you're going to have to do remarkably well.",
      "\"There are too many players who don't do enough. Not just Dalot. In the last two games Man Utd have conceded six goals. What chance have you got? Newcastle are coming up in a few days, they'll come to Old Trafford and enjoy it, they'll have runners.",
      "\"These are the ugly bits of football. We know you've got the other bits, but you've got to do the ugly bits. That's what all the top teams do.",
      "\"But you can also dig deep, you can win playing ugly. You have to find a way to do that.",
      "\"Out of possession they're one of the worst teams in the league. With the ball they're good, but if you want to be a top footballer, it's about what you do out of possession.",
      "\"Man Utd cut corners, take too many risks and I'm glad they get punished. I like to see teams getting punished who take chances and let their team-mates and fans down.\"",

      "Goals were likely, United having scored four in each of their two previous games but struggled defensively. And yet, the goalkeepers starred until late in the first half, Senne Lammens keeping out John McGinn, Emi Martinez saving well from Benjamin Sesko.",
      "A bit of Rogers magic brought the breakthrough, cutting inside and finding the top corner. But Villa's celebrations were brief because Matty Cash was dispossessed by Patrick Dorgu, allowing Cunha to run through unchallenged to level before the interval.",

      "United were worth their equaliser, having played the more enterprising football in the opening 45 minutes. But it became trickier in the second half, Bruno Fernandes going off injured and Lisandro Martinez coming on in midfield with Kobbie Mainoo absent.",
      "Rogers' second, another curled effort beyond Lammens, restored Villa's lead and this time Cunha could not find the response. The Brazilian forward should have done so. His unmarked header from Dorgu's left-wing cross missed the target from six yards out.",
      "This was only the second time in 30 years that Aston Villa have beaten Manchester United at Villa Park.",

      "\"Sometimes the team does not work as a team and you have off days, then you need your X factors and game changers and they win you games out of absolutely nothing.",
      "\"And that is what Rogers is at the moment, he has been absolutely outstanding the last 10 games or so. They were not outstanding, but they had a game-changer.\"",
      "\"I think it's soft tissue [Fernandes injury] so it's going to be a while. We'll see.",
      "\"It is really strange. During this year, especially at this time, we have so many problems, but we have to cope with that. I think [Jack] Fletcher did his first game, so that is good news, [Shea] Lacey the same, so we will try to find solutions and go for the next game.",
      "\"I am a manager for six years and even Sporting is all about the academy, so it's about the history. Every manager wants to bring players through from the academy and not spend money because this gives value to the manager.",
      "\"I just want to win and want to be certain that the players that come in from the academy are not going to suffer too much. I'm just trying to help the club, it doesn't matter if it's from the academy or abroad.",
      "\"I think we were the better team today. We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno, but during the game even without him we were the better team. We did a very good job that no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\"",
      "When Morgan Rogers first arrived at Aston Villa from Middlesbrough, the raw talent and traits were clear to see.",
      "He was a strong and powerful runner with the ball who was capable of getting himself into dangerous positions, while also creating for teammates.",

      "Rogers isn't just a capable finisher anymore; he's performing at an elite level. And elite players are capable of replicating the extraordinary on a consistent basis.",
      "You can make an argument about whether or not this level of finishing is sustainable but currently, with his confidence sky high, anything is possible.",
      "The England international isn't just a key figure in the team anymore; he's been given the keys by Unai Emery and now puts the team on his back when it matters most.",
      "Emery has always demanded a lot of Rogers and always will.",
      "The long-range efforts might not be sustainable but the lofty standards his manager sets for him, and the drive to meet those targets, will be ever-present.",
      "It won't always be as jaw-droppingly impressive as his recent form is but one way or another, Rogers will continue to contribute.",
      "And if that is the case, Villa might just keep on winning.",
