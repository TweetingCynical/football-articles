      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana is set to join Trabzonspor on loan. While Premier League clubs are not allowed to sign new players until the new year, the Turkish transfer window is one of a handful to remain open a little longer this month.",
      "Onana moved to Old Trafford from Inter Milan in 2023 and spent the last two seasons as first choice. He was left out by Ruben Amorim at the start of the campaign, though, with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",
      "United added Senne Lammens to their ranks on Monday, paying a little over £18million for the young Belgian. The move appears to have accelerated Onana's departure, though the move is a straightforward loan with no buy option included.",
      "According to The Athletic, the Cameroon international's United wages will be covered by the Turkish club. He is also entitled to bonuses which could see him double his current earnings.",
      "Onana is due to complete his move after playing for Cameroon against Cape Verde. Victory would see the Indomitable Lions move to the top of their World Cup qualifying group, with all group winners progressing to next summer's tournament and the four best runners-up getting a second chance via the play-offs.",
      "Former Chelsea and Scotland star Craig Burley questioned Onana's progress since his arrival at Old Trafford. \"[He's] another player who’s gone to Manchester United and got worse. He cost a lot of money but he wasn’t able to marshal a back four,\" Burley told ESPN.",
      "\"I thought Onana would be the real deal, it looked that way in Italy. I thought he might have a Peter Schmeichel-esque aura about him and boss about players but it hasn’t happened. If this new, youngish lad comes in and starts flapping about all over the place, it’s going to be a mess.\"",
      "Lammens, 23, has outlined how he wants to earn the backing of the defenders in front of him. “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” he told club media.",
      "“They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "“My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life, I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andre Onana is said to be open to the idea of leaving Manchester United for Turkey - but has yet to make a final decision on a move to Trabzonspor. The former Inter Milan man has endured a rollercoaster couple of seasons at Old Trafford since arriving for £43m.",
      "High-profile errors have blighted his performances, while Onana has found himself behind Altay Bayindir this season. The Cameroonian then fell even further down the pecking order with the £18m arrival of Senne Lammens on deadline day. United have been open to letting Onana leave all summer, albeit he did not manage to find a new club before the end of the Premier League window. Since then, Turkish side Trabzonspor have opened talks with United regarding a loan move.",
      "According to The Athletic, the move would be a straight loan with a buy option. Trabzonspor now need Onana’s approval to complete a move and while he is open to a switch, he still wants to review the contract on offer.",
      "The Turkish window remains open until September 12, with Trabzonspor keen to get a deal secured ahead of their next game against Fenerbahce, which takes place two days later. Onana still has three years left on the long-term contract he signed when he moved to Old Trafford back in the summer of 2023.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim recently leapt to Onana’s defence after a poor performance against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. He said: \"They are humans. At Manchester United, everything is analysed. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper and these situations keep happening. We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper.\"",
      "Elsewhere, United’s summer addition Lammens has already made a number of promises should he be installed as the Red Devil’s number one following his arrival from Royal Antwerp. “I think if you want to be a good goalkeeper, you have to be a rock behind the defence,” said Lammens. “They have to trust you and count on you in difficult moments. That is something I take pride in. Of course, I can improve in this because the next level is bigger, but it is one of my attributes that I am proud of and I try to improve.",
      "“My parents are also really calm and collected, but [I also developed this mentality] from growing up, when I was in the youth team and I thought about the goalkeeper I wanted to become later in life.",
      "“I think one of the best attributes you can have as a goalkeeper is staying calm under pressure, in any circumstances, even if you make a mistake or something. You just move on and try to give your best to the team.”",

      "Former Chelsea star Craig Burley insists that Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim simply \"can't play\" goalkeeper Altay Bayindir again this season - because he is \"absolutely useless\" at dealing with set-pieces.",
      "United have had bad luck with goalkeepers in recent years after signing Andre Onana for £47m in 2023, only to see a number of high profile errors from the Cameroon international. Onana now looks likely to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on a season-long loan with Bayindir starting their first three games in the Premier League.",
      "The club are open to letting Onana go after signing promising goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in the final hours of the summer transfer window for around £18m, with the young Belgian expected to go on and establish himself as the club's first choice shot-stopper.",
      "And Burley is adamant that playing Bayindir is no longer an option for Amorim after watching the keeper' fail to convince in his outings so far this term, where he has been exposed from set-pieces in particular. \"Altay Bayindir, they can’t play him,\" Burley told ESPN. \"He might be okay at shot-stopping, which is what goalkeepers are paid for, but he’s absolutely useless at dealing with balls in from set-pieces.",
      "\"This new lad [Lammens] needs to be able to marshal a back four, make saves and have an authority and make a statement at set-pieces. That’s what every team is going to do against United now, they’re going to launch balls into the box and the goalkeeper needs to be able to deal with it. He’s either going to sink or swim. We don’t really know how he’s going to handle this scenario.\"",
      "He was also critical of Onana as he claimed the former Inter Milan star has \"got worse\" since arriving at United and warned Lammens he must make good decisions and be assertive or there could be a \"mess\" at the club.",
      "\"[Onana] another player who’s gone to Manchester United and got worse. He cost a lot of money but he wasn’t able to marshal a back four. I thought Onana would be the real deal, it looked that way in Italy. I thought he might have a Peter Schmeichel-esque aura about him and boss about players but it hasn’t happened. If this new, youngish lad comes in and starts flapping about all over the place, it’s going to be a mess.\"",
      "While Lammens has been backed to be the new United No 1, former Red Devils shot-stopper Ben Foster believes the signing is a \"panic buy\" and said the club needed someone \"with broad shoulders\" in between the sticks.",
      "He said: \"I’ve watched a lot of videos of him [Lammens] on YouTube … and he looks on the eye test like he’s a competent goalkeeper. I’m yet to see what he’s like with the ball at his feet though and I think he’s a panic buy.",
      "\"United have probably always got some sort of list of goalkeepers that they look at and they keep tabs on. There will be scouts all over the world …but I don’t think they’ve done an in-depth analysis. A deadline day goalkeeper signing tells me that your club is desperate.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has given Manchester United a timely fitness boost after sharing a positive update on his injury. Cunha was forced off during United’s 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break, sparking fears he could be set for a spell on the sidelines.",
      "The £62.5million summer signing from Wolves went down in the first half of the Premier League game clutching his right hamstring. Both he and Mason Mount picked up injuries in the match, which took the shine off United’s first league win of the season.",
      "Cunha was forced to pull out of Brazil's squad for their World Cup qualifiers in the international break. He reassured fans by saying that he'll be 'back soon', though, and there was more good news on the Brazilian’s Instagram account.",
      "Posting a photo of himself on an exercise bike in the gym, Cunha wrote: \"The time is flying,\" alongside a clock emoji and dynamite emoji. He then shared another photo of him posing with a UFC wristband saying: ‘obrigado pela moral’, which translates to ‘thanks for the moral’.",
      "Ruben Amorim will be desperate to have Cunha available for their trip to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. United have picked up where they left off last season, struggling for creativity, despite spending over £200m on new forwards. They opened the campaign with a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal before a 1-1 draw against Fulham and an embarrassing defeat by Grimsby on penalties. The win over Burnley came via a late penalty and Amorim expressed his worries post-match.",
      "\"It was hard to lose Cunha and Mason Mount, because Mason Mount played 30 minutes with an injury,\" he said. \"I'm concerned about that, because they are so important for us. We will see.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't know [how are they], I don't know. We will check them. We need those guys really bad to be really competitive.\"",
      "Amorim will get a clearer picture of Cunha’s fitness levels in the coming days before he decides on his squad and line-up for the Manchester Derby. While Cunha is yet to get off the mark in a United shirt, his fellow new forward Bryan Mbeumo has now netted in back-to-back matches. The £71m signing from Brentford scored in the defeat by Grimsby before finding the net against in the win over Burnley.",
      "“Every game is hard and important. We had the game with us in the first half, but we had to fight every minute,” Amorim told BBC Match of the Day. “I'm very happy, and we win as well – as a striker, it is important to be confident with goals.”",

      "Thomas Tuchel has admitted that Marcus Rashford struggles to 'wow' in an England shirt after he and several others failed to impress against Andorra at Wembley. The Manchester United forward got a fresh start this summer when he clinched a dream loan to Barcelona after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Rashford has endured a poor start to life in Catalonia. The 27-year-old has started just one out of the club’s opening three league games, while he was taken off at half-time during last month’s win against Levante. He is yet to contribute to a goal and that has led to suggestions in Spain that Barcelona could attempt to cancel the loan agreement for the forward early.",
      "He was unable to make the most of an opportunity to open his account for the season as England stumbled to an underwhelming 2-0 win over Andorra on Saturday, with Tuchel keeping faith in the forward since taking the helm as the Three Lions boss.",
      "However, even the German admits that Rashford has struggled to live up to his potential in an England shirt. \"He struggles a bit with numbers and with the ‘wow’ performance in an England shirt, I agree,” Tuchel said post-match.",
      "“But as long as he trains like he did and behaves and is active and alive in the group, then we will always trust him and push him and support him. I can see that he tries, this is for me the most important that he stays positive and he trains at the moment with the right attitude, with a smile and with a lot of quality.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Rashford has already given his verdict on his slow start to life with Barcelona, and admitted that he was still off the pace when it came to the fitness. He said: “The intensity here is very high.",
      "“Preseason has been tough; I finished exhausted after every session. It’s not just about running—it’s about working with the ball and keeping a constant level. That’s what really takes the most effort.”",
      "After starting against Andorra, Rashford will certainly hope to earn more minutes in the Three Lions’ next outing against Serbia on Tuesday. Attention will then turn back to Barcelona, the Catalan giants next in action against Valencia.",
      "Rashford will then get the opportunity to return to England as Barcelona take on Newcastle at St James’ Park in their first Champions League fixture of the season.",

      "Manchester United responded positively to Harry Maguire's transfer summons after the defender called for renovations in the summer. The 32-year-old predicted there would be \"a lot of changes\" taking place during the transfer window and was proved right after Ruben Amorim transformed the make-up of his squad.",
      "United revolutionised their attack with the additions of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for a combined investment of around £200million. Sesko, 22, was later to arrive at Old Trafford, but it would be fair to consider all three players part of Amorim's new starting XI.",
      "The same might be said for goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who was signed from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. The Belgian is yet to make his debut between the posts for United but should be the new No. 1 given the concerns that have surrounded incumbent keepers Andre Onana, who has reportedly agreed a loan move to Trabzonspor, and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Perhaps even more pertinent are United's departures, however, with no fewer than 12 players leaving the club either permanently or on loan. Wingers Antony and Alejandro Garnacho left on permanent transfers, while Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund have each departed on temporary deals.",
      "The Red Devils have been slow out of the gates this season, but Amorim can't say he hasn't been handed the means to make his own imprint on the team. And Maguire has also got his way after urging the club to take action over the summer months.",
      "\"We will make a lot of changes in the summer at the club,\" said the England international in May. \"There will be a lot of players who leave and hopefully a lot of players will come in.",
      "\"And that’s down to the club to make sure they get that right, and it’s down to us players to make sure that we are the ones that are involved.\"",
      "United were anticipated to struggle for funds this summer after finishing 15th in the Premier League last term. That, coupled with their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, saw them fail to qualify for any European competition for the first time in a decade.",
      "Yet a net spend of around £160m proved the coffers were hardly empty. Not to mention co-owners Ineos showed their commitment to Amorim's project by backing the boss in the transfer market.",
      "Maguire, meanwhile, has found himself out of Amorim's XI at the start of this season after managing just two Premier League appearances off the bench thus far. Amorim has preferred a centre-back trio of Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw and Matthijs de Ligt, while Lisandro Martinez is still recovering from the serious knee injury he suffered in February.",
      "Such widespread changes will require time to take effect at Old Trafford, time United don't have as they look to regain their former glories. But Maguire nor the fans can complain the club hasn't taken action in its efforts to get back on top.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones believes it's crucial that the Old Trafford club offer manager Ruben Amorim much more than support in the transfer market.",
      "Jones, who spent 12 years with the Reds after being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in a £16.5million deal from Blackburn in 2011, became a Premier League title winner under the club’s greatest-ever manager before experiencing United’s spectacular fall from grace when the Scot retired in 2013. He has been encouraged with the way co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sanctioned a £200million-plus summer spend that has brought Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens to Manchester this summer.",
      "But Jones feels that Amorim must be given time to make his methods work - and that the Portuguese’s task would be made easier if United overhauled the playing style of their much-vaunted academy so that youth graduates are coached to play the three-at-the-back tactical system the manager is committed to.",
      "Jones spent two years coaching the kids at Carrington after hanging up his boots in 2024. Speaking exclusively to Free Bets, the home of the best betting sites, he said: “One of the questions I asked was why the youth and academy teams didn’t play the same system that Amorim was bringing in at senior level.",
      "“These kids need to learn how to play in different positions and in different systems to have a career in the game. Hopefully they do go on to have a career at Old Trafford, but if they are going to have any success in the game then they need to be adaptable.",
      "“I think it’s good for youngsters to play in different positions and systems. But there definitely has to be an alignment right through the academy so that it prepares players for the first team.",
      "“If a player gets a call into the senior squad - which has happened for years and years at United - they have to be ready to play the system the manager employs. They have to have an understanding of it.”",
      "Jones added: “I think it’s important that United don’t shoot the gun too early with another manager. Last season was bad. But I’ve been buoyed by some of the performances I’ve seen in the Premier League this season.",
      "“Five points from three games is something to build on. If Amorim can take four points from the games against (Manchester) City and Chelsea after the international break then suddenly it looks like he’s on the right track.",
      "“You cannot gloss over that performance in the Grimsby game in the Carabao Cup. United were terrible all over the pitch.",
      "“What do you do? Keep swapping the manger and then give someone else £200million to spend? United have got to back Amorim. He’s a young manger with fresh ideas and I think he will get it right.",
      "“Every time a manager was sacked after Sir Alex left, the club would brief that we were in transition. But United have probably been in a constant transition for 10 years now. They wanted Amorim because he plays a different system and a different way to how United traditionally play. He’s not going to change - and nor should he change.”",
      "Amorim, 40, is an emotional manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. Jones has been surprised at how honest he has been when assessing the quality of the squad at his disposal - but has urged him not to lose that edge.",
      "He said: “I remember playing against Ruben in the Champions League when he played for Braga. What I like about him is that he’s authentic - and authenticity in this game is a massively positive characteristic in my opinion.",
      "“I don’t think you should try to be cool and calm when you’re not, just like you shouldn’t turn on the anger if that’s not you either.",
      "“I don’t think Amorim should change. Obviously there are times when he wants to avoid saying certain things, but ultimately he has to be his own person.”",

      "The ex-Spurs star has yet to find a new team despite being able to engage with prospective clubs since the beginning of the year. Eriksen was not selected for Denmark's World Cup qualifiers against Scotland and Greece, after scoring in June friendlies against Northern Ireland and Lithuania. The playmaker is said to have turned down the chance of joining Wrexham, while reports suggested that Burnley were also interested in adding Eriksen amid competition from across Europe. The transfer window is shut, but as a free agent Eriksen can still find a new club.",
      "And Gravesen is aghast at the preparations that Eriksen is currently undertaking. Eriksen is training with Malmo, but perhaps has little chance of a deal with the club having already been required to submit their Europa League squad.",
      "\"It is incomprehensible to me that he chooses Malmo,\" Gravesen said in a recent interview with Fotboll Skanalen. \"It is not a club that he can go to because he cannot sign a contract with them and we have some clubs in Denmark that are much, much better than Malmo.",
      "\"This looks like a friendly thing, where Christian Eriksen is over and having fun with some friends. Where is the ambition to play football?",

      "The winger has featured in all three of Barcelona's first three La Liga games but is yet to impress for the team after playing a total of 95 minutes. He started Barcelona's 3-2 win at Levante last month but was hooked at half time, with the hosts leading 2-0 at the time.",
      "He was also brought on as a sub during the season opening win at Mallorca and the 1-1 draw against Rayo Vallecano, but fans and pundits are yet to be convinced he will be a valuable member of the squad.",
      "And there are reportedly concerns about Rashford in the boardroom too, according to Spanish outlet El Nacional, who says the club expected better displays from the England international at this point.",
      "It adds that bosses have founded his performances 'disappointing' and that they expect an improvement soon, but their patience won't be infinite.",
      "The report also suggests that president Joan Laporta and sporting director Deco were never convinced over Rashford's signing - having preferred Nico Williams or Luis Diaz.",
      "Hansi Flick was the one who pushed for the move, feeling he could help Rashford recapture the form that turned him into a superstar at Old Trafford. Speaking after the opening game of the season, Flick said he was confident that Rashford would have a strong impact with the Spanish champions.",
      "\"He gives us more possibilities,\" he said last month. \"I know he's more comfortable playing as a winger, but with his strengths, he contributes a lot to our play. I'm confident we'll see a great Marcus Rashford this season.\"",
      "The Spanish side would have to pay a fee of around £4.3m if they decided to send Rashford back early. Chelsea had to pay a similar penalty fee of £5m to United after refusing to take up their obligation to sign Jadon Sancho at the end of last season.",
      "The news continues Rashford's turbulent year after initially falling out with manager Amorim, who took issue with the player's attitude in training.",

      "Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer has sent a cryptic message to Kobbie Mainoo after his request to leave Manchester United on loan was denied. Frustrated by his lack of opportunities, Mainoo, 20, reportedly asked to leave Old Trafford on a temporary basis in the closing days of the summer transfer window.",
      "After United's 1-1 draw away to Fulham, which marked the second consecutive Premier League game where Mainoo was an unused substitute, Amorim said the midfielder is directly competing with Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI. Things got worse for the young Englishman when he started in United's humiliating League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "Chelsea have previously been linked with him, but the Blues made no approach this summer. The midfielder recently uploaded a picture of himself carrying out his own training sessions during the international break, as well as a cryptic picture of the scene from hit movie Whiplash, where main character Andrew punched a hole in his drum kit, suggesting he is growing restless at his current situation.",
      "Palmer, who is also absent from England's squad due to a groin injury he picked up before Chelsea's 5-1 away victory over West Ham United, then responded with his own suggestive message in the comment section of Mainoo's post. The ex-Manchester City midfielder wrote: \"3 my boy\" along with a love heart emoji.",
      "Some interpreted this to mean Mainoo should look for an exit from Old Trafford, although what Palmer ultimately meant remains the subject of conjecture. Last summer, Mainoo started all but two of England's matches to the Euro 2024 final, including the final itself.",
      "Despite the likes of Jude Bellingham, Adam Wharton, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden either being ruled out through injury or not selected, Tuchel chose not to call-up Mainoo.",
      "Similarly to his challenge at Old Trafford, the young midfielder has a difficult task ahead of him when it comes to forcing his way into Tuchel's plans.",
      "The intense, personal training sessions in the gym and on the training field could earn him a start in United's huge clash against Manchester City after the break. With Amorim insistent on deploying his 3-4-3 formation, Mainoo has to either displace Fernandes or Casemiro, a player the United boss has relied upon since his move to Old Trafford.",
      "It's a tall order for the United academy star, as Fernandes is United's captain and, arguably, the club's best player of the last five years, while Casemiro is a specialised, deep-holding midfielder.",
      "Explaining why Mainoo did not get on against Fulham, Amorim said: \"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno. I changed two midfielders.",
      "\"I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder. So he needs to fight for his position. At the moment he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "In the Red Devils' narrow 3-2 home victory over Burnley, Amorim opted to deploy Mainoo ahead of Ugarte, suggesting the youngster has moved one step close to the United boss' thoughts. He boasts 10 international caps for England, having made his debut in the 1-0 home loss to Brazil in March 2024.",

The Mariners have been embroiled in controversy this past week after the EFL slapped Town with a penalty for fielding an ineligible player in their second round win.",
      "United are not believed to be mounting an appeal against the League Two outfit's sanction. The penalty saw Grimsby hit with a £20,000 fine for their administrative blunder.",
      "It's understood the Mariners reported the breach themselves and the EFL announced their verdict. That's despite previous FA Cup precedent seeing clubs ejected from the tournament.",

      "\"We were the better team for 70 minutes or for 75 minutes. We should have been 3-0 regardless of everything else that has gone off since, and I am extremely proud of the performance of the players, all of the players. I thought we deserved to win the game.",
      "\"What happens surrounding that isn't in my domain [to say] but, like I say, nobody can take away the performance of the players and the manner of the victory, certainly not in my eyes anyway. What happened was unfortunate, we owned up, made a statement, let everyone know and we move on.\"",
      "Grimsby were found to be in breach of the laws after Clarke Oduor came on against the Red Devils. Oduor joined the Mariners on loan from Bradford City one day prior to the cup fixture.",
      "However, it later came to light their loanee's deal had gone through 119 seconds after the deadline. And as such, he was not eligible to feature for the club.",
      "Of their fine, £10,000 must be paid before a predetermined deadline, while the other £10,000 is suspended until the end of the season. Liverpool, Accrington Stanley and Sunderland are the other three clubs who have in the past been fined for similar League Cup infractions.",
      "Grimsby's reward for advancing past United is a third-round fixture against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. This will mark the first time since 2019 that the former has featured in the third round of the tournament.",
      "Despite the triumph over United, Grimsby have failed to maintain their momentum and lost their last two fixture. Artell's side are looking to bounce back from their most recent disappointment, a 1-0 defeat to Bristol Rovers, as they prepare to take on MK Dons on Saturday.",

      "The South American has been getting up to speed with Enzo Maresca's side in his first training sessions with the club. In a video uploaded to social media, Garnacho could be seen being worked hard in his first training session.",
      "This may not be too surprising as the winger spent the entire pre-season training on his own at the Red Devils, after being sent out to United's so-called 'Bomb Squad' of players who were banished from the first team. There was no sympathy for Garnacho in west London, as could be seen in Fofana's cutting response to him.",
      "During his first training session, Garnacho could be seen struggling for breath as he was put through his paces. The start of the clip shows him sitting down on the floor with his feet stretched out as a Chelsea coach says: \"Take a stretch, have a breather, take your time!\"",
      "The next clip showed the United academy graduate, before he went on to shake his head, saying: \"I can't move my legs now man. That sprint in the last one.\"",
      "Watching his new team-mate struggle for breath, Fofana, who has had more than his fair share of injury problems at Stamford Bridge, said: \"Welcome to Chelsea Football Club, eh.\"",
      "The Frenchman's short, but serious message, highlighted to Garnacho he will need to work extremely hard, every day in training, if he is going to thrive in west London. He faces serious competition for places with the Blues, as he will be up against £52m summer signing Jamie Gittens, the dynamic Pedro Neto and Brazilian superstar Estevao Willian.",
      "With Cole Palmer also primarily starring as a No. 10 and centre-forwards Liam Delap and Joao Pedro impressing while on the pitch with each other, Garnacho may also find himself in competition with the latter. He will have the international break to get up to speed in the capital, as Argentina chose not to call him up for their clashes against Venezuela and Ecuador.",
      "He arrives at a bustling Stamford Bridge, which has seen the Blues start the Premier League campaign in positive fashion. A nervous 0-0 draw was followed by a 5-1 away demolition of West Ham, before the Blues edged their way past local rivals Fulham at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The forward could make his debut when Chelsea travel to Brentford in their first match after the international break. Garnacho was also included in Chelsea's squad for the Champions League, which could see him face off against Bayern Munich in their first Champions League clash since the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "He will then be champing at the bit for the Blues' next Premier League clash which will be a first return to Old Trafford and a reunion with United boss Ruben Amorim.",

      "Andrews brought in Drury as his assistant first-team coach, but the relationship has not lasted long at all. BBC Sport reports that he is leaving the club just three Premier League games into the new season, with no explanation yet given.",
      "Drury has previously worked at United, West Brom, Bradford and Valencia before linking up with Brentford in July. After being appointed, he posted on X: “Delighted to be joining such a fantastic football club. Very much looking forward to working with all the staff and this exciting group of players.”",
      "Before joining Brentford, Drury had worked as an assistant to Carlos Corberan at La Liga side Valencia. “With great sadness, I am leaving Valencia,” he wrote on July 5. “The city, the club, and the incredible people with whom I have grown up will always be in my heart.",
      "“Thank you very much to the players and the staff; I have enjoyed every day with you all. I will be a Valencianista forever and I hope to be able to return someday.”",
      "Drury began his coaching career at Bradford, where he worked his way up to become head of coaching at the Bantams’ academy. He worked across a variety of the club’s academy sides before that, spending six years with Braford in total.",
      "Drury moved to Manchester United, where he coached the under-15s side for two years. But it was his relationship with Corberan that helped him make the step up into senior first-team football, first as his assistant at West Brom.",

      "That quote could be pointed towards breaking into Amorim's group this season, the report says, as he looks to make his Red Devils debut this season, having previously trained with the first team during pre-season training camps.",
      "The Portuguese boss is known for bringing youngsters into his first team after doing so with the likes of Toby Collyer, Tyler Fredricson, Amad, Chido Obi and Harry Amass.",
      "Despite an influx on new signings arriving this summer, Amorim still named Fredricson on the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, which should give Bennett confidence that he can break through.",
      "Fredricson was given an opportunity to start in United's shock Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town last month but was hooked at half time and Bennett could sense an opportunity to replace him in Amorim's thinking, the report goes on.",
      "He played 38 times in all competitions for Fleetwood last season, scoring once, as the team finished in 14th place.",
      "There is real hope for Bennett after he captained a Manchester United Under-18s side that won the FA Youth Cup in 2022, the same team that featured breakthrough stars such as Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Dan Gore.",
      "Speaking last season, Bennett said the experience of battling for points in League Two taught him a lot and added a huge string to his bow in terms of playing under pressure.",
      "\"That has been massive for me and I like having that bit of added pressure to games and scenarios. When I was younger, I used to get carried away with thinking, ‘what's the next couple of years going to look like?’ You can lose focus on what's in front of you right now. It’s still in the back of my mind, but the focus is on the next game and getting the most out of this.\"",

      "Michael Owen has confidently stated that he was a better player than Wayne Rooney as a youngster. Owen was a teenage phenomenon at Liverpool, where he began scoring goals consistently at the age of 17.",
      "The England striker was prolific during his early years with the Reds, where he enjoyed by far the best years of his career. Owen netted 158 goals in 297 appearances for the club over eight years and won the Ballon d’Or as a 22-year-old in 2001.",
      "He carried that form over into international football, registering 40 goals in 89 appearances for England, a record that aids the comparison with Rooney. The Manchester United legend started out at Everton, where he burst onto the scene as an exciting and raw 16-year-old talent.",
      "Rooney earned a £25million move to United as an 18-year-old and went on to become the club’s all-time record goal scorer. He also comfortably passed Owen’s tally of 150 Premier League goals, reaching 208, and his number with England, notching 53 from 120 games.",
      "While both were undoubtedly great English strikers, the question of who was better at an early age has been raised on social media. Match of the Day posed the question on X: “Who was the better player at the age of 17, Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney?”",
      "Owen replied: “At 17 I scored 18 PL goals (winning the Golden Boot), Wazza scored 6. At 18 I again scored 18 goals (again winning the Golden Boot and coming 4th in The Ballon d’Or), Wazza scored 9. In our opening 7 seasons, Wazza didn’t outscore me once (117 goals v 80).",
      "“In which time I became the 2nd youngest Ballon d’Or winner ever. Injuries hindered me from then on while he sustained his level. Therefore, he’ll go down as a better player than me. But, at 17, please……”",
      "Owen went on to join Real Madrid in 2004, but only spent one year in Spain, with injuries later impacting his career, which took him to Newcastle, United and Stoke. He expanded on his assessment of his career on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast this week.",
      "“Was there another 18-year-old who was near me at 18? I was light years clear of anything in my age group – anything and probably anything around my age group in England,” he said.",
      "“I got into the Liverpool team and won the Golden Boot at 17. Forget all the achievements, there will never ever be a two-time Golden Boot winner as a 17-year-old and 18-year-old in the Premier League.”",
      "He added: “I sort of split my career into two: almost Liverpool and maybe Madrid, and then afterwards, because I just wasn't the same. Not that I didn't like it – I loved it at United. I love you (Rio) and the lads and whatever.",
      "“But I'm not me. I'm not me. You know what I was when I was 18, and you know what I was when I was 30. It's like, I was half-embarrassed. I'm coming out to these big stadiums, St James' Park, Old Trafford, with my name on my back.",
      "“It's like, can I not just change my name and just think of something, like call me something else? I don't want people to remember me like this. [I was] still good, still scoring, but I'm not what I was. It's killing me. But it's like, what can you do?”",

      "Pep Guardiola's warning over Jadon Sancho's mentality fell on deaf ears when Manchester United finally signed the winger back in 2021. Sancho broke through the Manchester City youth academy in 2017 under the Spanish boss.",
      "However, the 25-year-old failed to ever make a professional appearance for the Cityzens as he was shipped off to Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth around £8million. Asked in 2019 why Sancho was sold on rather than deployed by Guardiola, the 54-year-old said: \"I don't know.",
      "\"He didn't want to take this challenge [to fight his way into the first team], this opportunity to discover if he was able to. He decided to go there. So, it's perfect. It's going well and congratulations on what he is doing.",
      "\"He is doing an incredible performance. He did it incredibly well this season. What would have happened this season [at City]? I don't know. Again, with the players, it depends on them and what they do on the pitch.\"",
      "While Guardiola was quick to share his delight that Sancho was seeing success in the Bundesliga, his comments regarding the winger's will to fight for his place may have sounded alarm bells among many managers.",
      "Sancho's tally of 50 goals and 64 assists in 137 outings for Die Schwarzgelben between 2017 and 2021 was alluring enough to see United snap him up in a £73m move after a prolonged chase for his signature.",
      "But his tenure with the Red Devils has been far from smooth sailing in the years since. In his first two seasons at Old Trafford, Sancho managed just nine Premier League goals from 55 games, before he rejoined Dortmund after falling out with Erik ten Hag for his performances in training.",
      "Speaking following United's 3-1 loss to Arsenal back in September 2023 – a game in which Sancho did not travel for – Ten Hag said: \"Jadon, on his performances in training we did not select him. You have to reach a level every day at Manchester United and we can make choices in the front line. So for this game he was not selected.\"",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, was quick to fire back at his manager's comments, claiming that he was being used as a \"scapegoat.\" He wrote on social media: \"Please don't believe everything you read.",
      "\"I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself in training very well this week. I believe there are other reasons for this matter which I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!",
      "\"All I want to do is play football with a smile on my face and contribute to the team. I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and grateful to do so which I know every week is a challenge. I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what!\"",
      "The Englishman returned to Dortmund on a short-term loan in January 2024 before making his way back to the Red Devils in the summer, where he drew a line with Ten Hag on their disagreement. However, his tenure at Old Trafford didn't last long, joining Chelsea on a season-long loan with a £25m obligation to buy dependent on performances.",
      "Despite a somewhat fruitful campaign with Chelsea, the board ultimately opted not to exercise their mandatory purchase, instead paying a £5m penalty to see Sancho head back to the north west under new boss Ruben Amorim. But yet again, his tenure at Old Trafford was curtailed when the Portuguese tactician deemed him surplus to requirements with regards to his own plans.",
      "As a result, Sancho has secured a transfer deadline day move to Aston Villa on loan, where he will hope for a Premier League resurgence under Unai Emery. Given that Sancho's contract expires next summer, there is no obligation to buy attached to the deal. However, the United board also have the option to extend his contract by a year to prevent him walking away from the club as a free agent.",

      "With that being said, take a look at all of the news coming out of the red half of Manchester:",

      "Amorim is reported to have met Semenyo for dinner in London at the end of last season to judge the player's character. CEO Omar Berrada and transfer chief Jason Wilcox also held conversations with Bournemouth.",
      "But those efforts were in vain as Semenyo eventually penned a new contract with the Cherries.",

      "Emiliano Martinez's family have spoken out after the Aston Villa goalkeeper missed out on a deadline day transfer to Manchester United. Martinez, 33, was a target for the Red Devils, who wanted to sign a new goalkeeper before the summer transfer window closed on Monday.",
      "But United also had Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens on their radar, sparking an internal debate over which shot-stopper to pursue. Ultimately, Ruben Amorim's side pressed on to reach an agreement with Antwerp and signed 23-year-old Lammens for an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in add-ons.",
      "That was despite Martinez agreeing personal terms with the Red Devils and waiting at Villa's training ground on Monday for a call which never came. It's also been reported that the former Arsenal star asked United defender and fellow Argentine Lisandro Martinez to vouch for him.",
      "But Martinez, who missed Villa's 3-0 loss at home to Crystal Palace in the lead-up to deadline day, remains in a part of Unai Emery's squad and is under contract until 2029. The length of his deal and his reputation as a World Cup winner is why Villa Park chiefs would've demanded much more than what United paid for Lammens.",
      "Martinez's brother, Alejandro, and his father, Alberto, have now discussed the 'dispute' which led to the failed move. \"I was told that Emi gave a lot as a professional and as a person, they love him, and you could see that on the pitch,\" Alejandro told DSports Radio.",
      "\"He is well-liked, and the directors didn't want to sell him because he is the key player in the team, and another team wanted him. It was a commercial dispute.",
      "\"These are decisions made by club officials. It didn't happen, but it's like everything else in business. The sporting side of things was left out of it, and everything is fine.\"",
      "His brother also brushed off suggestions that Martinez had fallen out with Emery. \"Emi never had an argument with Unai,\" Alejandro continued. \"It was all within the management's control, and the clubs couldn't agree.",
      "\"At Aston Villa, he's the Diego [Maradona] of Napoli. He gave a lot at Villa, like Kun [Aguero] did at [Manchester] City, like Leo [Messi] did at Barca. They're legendary players, and it's going to be hard to surpass what he did at Aston Villa.\"",
      "Dad Alberto added: \"This is a job, this is a factory, and factories have employees. He's just another employee, and the factory won't let him go if he's good. It's all business. Tomorrow it will happen, today it didn't happen.\"",
      "Martinez is now with the Argentina squad, playing keeping a clean sheet in Thursday's 3-0 victory over Venezuela. After travelling to Ecuador for their final World Cup qualifier, he'll return to Birmingham and prepare for next Villa's trip to Everton next Saturday.",

      "The goalkeeper has not featured in United's opening three Premier League games, with Altay Bayindir preferred, while the deadline day arrival of Senne Lammens adds another level of competition.",
      "Onana, who cost United £43.9million when he arrived from Inter Milan in 2023, is reportedly weighing up a move to Trabzonspor.",
      "The transfer window in Turkey is open until September 12, while Onana, who has three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, is currently on international duty with Cameroon.",
      "Trabzonspor are currently second in the Turkish Super Lig after an unbeaten start to the campaign and face Fenerbahce in their next match on September 14.",
      "That could, in theory, be Onana's debut for the club if a move was agreed, and it would be his first league outing since United's defeat to Chelsea in mid May.",
      "Amorim has overlooked Onana in the top flight this season despite the keeper, who missed pre-season with an injury, returning to full fitness.",
      "Baynidir started the season opener at Arsenal, with Amorim saying: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life.",
      "\"This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he's recovered, but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "But next week was not different, with Bayindir preferred.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay. Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked after the question was posed in the wake of the defeat to Arsenal.",
      "\"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.\"",
      "Onana was given the gloves for the EFL Cup tie at League Two Grimsby but was at fault for at least one of the two goals scored by the Mariners as they completed a seismic shock and knocked United out on penalties after a 2-2 draw.",
      "Speaking about Onana after the defeat, Amorim said: \"It's not about the goalkeeper. It's not about the goalkeeper.",
      "\"With all due respect, against a fourth division side, we have to block everything about the opponent. Andre should touch the ball with his feet if we are in the high level.\"",
      "After Bayindir was at fault for one of Burnley's goals in United's 3-2 victory in the game following the Grimsby debacle, Amorim used his post match press conference to make a more general point about the pressures of playing in goal for the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United, everything is analysed. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper,\" he said.",
      "\"And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper and these situations keep happening. We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper.\"",

      "At £74million, the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig was without doubt the most eye-catching signing of the summer for Manchester United.",
      "United were in desperate need of a new forward, particularly after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed just seven Premier League goals between them last season, and Sesko was deemed to be the man to end their goalscoring woes.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last season but it is safe to say he has not hit the ground running at Old Trafford.",
      "He is yet to start a Premier League game, featuring for just 80 minutes across United's first three league matches, and his only start came in the shock Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko joined up with his Slovenia international team-mates at the start of the week and told the local media he was surprised at just how high the level was in England compared to Germany.",
      "“The level of the matches is certainly much higher, the players and teammates are also at a higher level. After all, English football is at the highest level in the world of football,” Sesko told Ekipa.",
      "“But I am very much looking forward to the coming period, also because I am getting better and faster in every training session, and I am also progressing in my football mentality every day.",
      "\"I wanted to move to England and, fortunately, my wish came true.”",
      "That coming period starts with a trip to Manchester City in the first Manchester derby of the season and he will be hoping to return to Manchester with a spring in his step after a positive international break.",
      "He certainly made the perfect start on Friday evening as he created a last gasp equaliser in Slovenia's 2-2 draw with Sweden in Ljubljana.",
      "Sesko somehow held off the Swedish defence while juggling the ball in mid-air. He managed to find his team-mate Zan Vipotnik who fired beyond goalkeeper Robin Olsen to secure a vital point for Slovenia.",
      "\"[Sesko] did a great job, it was not easy with the tall and strong Swedish defenders,\" Vipotnik told Slovenian outlet Ekipa.",
      "\"I followed his action and when I got into a shooting position, I did not hesitate. Luckily I scored.\"",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes which should improve his sharpness. He will now hope to face Switzerland on Monday when Slovenia take in their second World Cup qualifier of Group B at Basel's St Jakob Park.",

      "Paul Pogba and Ravel Morrison led Manchester United to FA Youth Cup victory in 2011.",
      "The Youth Cup is the most prestigious competition in academy football and United have won it more than any other club. They last lifted the trophy at Old Trafford in 2021/22.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo helped to end a 10-year wait at United for more success in the competition, following a triumph from a supremely talented team in 2011.",
      "The Class of 2011 was considered to have so much promise, they were dubbed the next ‘Class of 92’.",
      "So where are the players now? We've taken a closer look at their respective career paths.",
      "The 32-year-old only completed a permanent move out of United in 2018 to join West Brom for around £6m. The goalkeeper had previously worked his way up the Football League during loan spells at Oldham, Scunthorpe, Walsall, Yeovil, Doncaster, Preston and Aston Villa.",
      "Johnstone had joined United in July 2009 and quickly became first choice for United’s youth team. The 6ft 4ins shot-stopper made over 150 appearances for West Brom before signing for Crystal Palace in 2022.",
      "He is now the second choice goalkeeper at Wolves and has won four caps for England.",
      "Keane had been at United since the age of 11, until he finally left to join Burnley in 2015 after a successful loan spell at Turf Moor. Keane's two years playing under Sean Dyche earned him plenty of attention and he joined Everton in 2017 for a fee that could rise to £30m.",
      "The centre-back is still an important player at Everton and has 12 England caps to his name.",
      "An Italian centre-half, Fornasier joined the United set up in 2009 from Fiorentina.",
      "Although he helped United lift the 2011 FA Youth Cup and appeared in the Under-21 Squad, he failed to make a first team appearance and headed back to Italy in 2013.",
      "Spells at Sampdoria, Pescara, Venezia, Parma, Trapani, Cremonese and Monopoli followed. Fornasier currently plays for Nardo in Serie D.",
      "A powerhouse of a defender, there were high hopes for Sean McGinty at United.",
      "Unfortunately, these failed to materialise and McGinty was sent out on loan to Morecambe, Oxford United, Carlisle United and Tranmere before finally leaving in 2013 to Sheffield United in search of first-team football.",
      "McGinty has subsequently played for Rochdale, Aldershot, Torquay United, Partick Thistle, Greenock Morton, Ayr United, Hamilton Academical and Airdrieonians.",
      "Another defender straight from the United academy who sadly couldn’t make the grade at Old Trafford. Although appearing for England at all youth levels, Thorpe struggled for appearances at Rotherham United, where he joined after leaving United permanently in 2015.",
      "After spells at Bradford, Bolton and ATK of the Indian Premier League, Thorpe had a break from professional football. He last played for Greater Manchester club Stalybridge Celtic in 2024.",
      "After making his United senior debut in a cup game against Newcastle in 2012, Tunnicliffe famously won his father £10,000 after he bet £100 at 100/1 that his son, aged nine at the time, would make a first-team appearance for the Reds.",
      "Sadly, it did not progress much beyond that for the Bury-born midfielder and he left the club in 2014 to join Fulham, signed by former United coach Rene Meulensteen. Tunnicliffe went on to make 59 appearances, scoring twice for the Cottagers.",
      "Loans at Wigan and Blackburn came next, followed by a free transfer to Millwall in 2017. Tunnicliffe then played for Luton and Portsmouth before signing for Australian club Adelaide.",
      "Where to start with Paul Pogba?",
      "He became United's record signing after leaving United for Juventus in 2012 under acrimonious circumstances before re-signing in 2016 for £89m.",
      "Pogba had been promoted to the first team by Sir Alex Ferguson for a FA Cup game against Crawley Town in 2011, however, first-team opportunities would later be hard to come by, with Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick ahead him.",
      "He would make three first-team appearances in the Premier League and Europa League before his free transfer to Juve.",
      "Pogba's second stint in Manchester did not hit the heights that were expected, although he did win the League Cup and Europa League during his six-year stay.",
      "He returned to Juventus in 2022, but he was suspended in September 2023 due to the failure of a drug test. Pogba's contract was ended by mutual consent at the end of last year and he made his return to football with Monaco this summer.",
      "Lingard joined United at the age of seven and as a reward for winning the FA Youth Cup, he was handed his first professional contract in the summer of 2011. He was soon sent out on loan, and Leicester City was the chosen destination, with Lingard going on to make his competitive debut at The Foxes.",
      "Lingard was again sent out on loan in 2013 by David Moyes to Birmingham and Brighton, while finally managing to break through to the first team in 2014.",
      "He famously scored the winning goal in the 2016 FA Cup final and he also scored the opening goal in United’s 2016 FA Community Shield win, while also netting in the 2017 League Cup Final.",
      "The forward hit his peak in 2018 where an impressive season for United was followed by his key role in England's fourth-placed finish at the 2018 World Cup. Lingard was excellent during a loan with West Ham in 2020/21, but he remained at United for another season and left permanently for Nottingham Forest in 2022.",
      "Lingard has been playing for South Korean K League club FC Seoul since his surprise move in February 2024.",
      "Arguably the key man in the Class of 2011, Morrison overshadowed fellow teammates Pogba and Lingard with his pace, flair and vision. United legend Gary Neville described Morrison as 'a Paul Gascoigne-type who could beat men and score some incredible goals'.",
      "But off-field issues undermined his talent and United reluctantly let Morrison go. In 2012, he joined then Championship side West Ham and after spells at QPR, Cardiff, Lazio, Club Atlas and Ostersunds, Morrison returned to England with Sheffield United in 2019.",
      "Morrison only made four appearances for the Blades. He joined Dutch club ADO Den Haag and later signed for Derby County, which was followed by a move to reunite with Wayne Rooney at D.C. United.",
      "The 32-year-old midfielder currently plays for Precision FC in Dubai.",
      "After starting his footballing career at Ajax, Van Velzen became one of the youngest players in the FA Youth Cup winning team after joining in 2010. The tricky forward signed a professional contract in 2012 and was sent out on loan to Royal Antwerp in Belgium.",
      "He returned a few months later but by the summer of 2013 the decision was made to release Van Velzen from his contract. Van Velzen returned to the Netherlands and played for FC Utrecht, FC Volendam and Roda JC in the Eredivisie before a return to England in the summer of 2019.",
      "Van Velzen signed for League Two side Crawley, but he only made five appearances for the club and he went back to the Netherlands, where he still plays for VVSB.",
      "The lanky forward was United’s target man, becoming top scorer for the youth team with 16 goals including eight in their FA Youth Cup winning campaign.",
      "Keane made his first-team debut in late 2011, coming on in a defeat to Blackburn Rovers, but a knee ligament problem ruled him out of the entire 2012/2013 season.",
      "With a few unsuccessful loan spells away from United, Keane eventually left to join former Reds assistant manager Mike Phelan at Hull City in 2016. It took him two years to score his first goal for the club, coming in a 5-0 away win to Burton Albion in April 2018.",
      "Keane currently plays for Preston North End after stints with Ipswich Town and Wigan.",
      "Blackett left United permanently in 2016 after a loan spells at Blackpool, Birmingham and Celtic.",
      "He made over 100 appearances for Reading before representing Nottingham Forest, FC Cincinnati and Rotherham, but Blackett has been without a club as a free agent for over a year now.",
      "Cole joined Fulham along with Tunnicliffe in 2014. He currently plays for Warrington Town.",
      "Coll joined Derry City after being released from United, but his spell there only lasted half a season and he stopped playing professional football.",
      "Cofie worked his way around the lower reaches of the Football League and non-league circuit, adding 12 clubs to his name after leaving United. He entered coaching at the age of 27 in 2020.",
      "Centre-back Massacci returned to Italy following his release from United in 2012. He dropped out of football after leaving ASD Valentino Mazzola in 2017."

      "Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer to Catalonia permanent for £26m next summer. The 27-year-old has been selected for Thomas Tuchel's England squad - for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia in September - as the Three Lions edge closer to qualifying for next summer's tournament in the USA.",
      "The Reds academy graduate was criticised in some quarters for his performance during England's 2-0 win over Andorra. The Telegraph were among his critics - arguing that he \"disappeared\" against the European minnows at Villa Park.",
      "And Rashford has posted an update on social media platform Instagram after Saturday's win in Birmingham. \"Villa Park bringing us closer to our goal!\" he said. \"Great team performance, now it’s all eyes on Tuesday’s big game\"",
      "Rashford's post has received support in the form of likes from United defenders Leny Yoro and Tyrell Malacia, as well as a like from England teammate Jack Grealish.",
      "Tuchel has admitted that Rashford has struggled to live up to his potential in an England shirt. \"He struggles a bit with numbers and with the ‘wow’ performance in an England shirt, I agree,” Tuchel said post-match.",
      "“But as long as he trains like he did and behaves and is active and alive in the group, then we will always trust him and push him and support him. I can see that he tries, this is for me the most important that he stays positive and he trains at the moment with the right attitude, with a smile and with a lot of quality.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been reassured that his job isn't on the line. After the international break, Manchester United must take on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium before hosting Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim will be hoping his side can climb the table after a shaky start to the new Premier League season. United may have lost to Arsenal on the opening weekend, but they showed great promise.",
      "Unfortunately for the Reds, it didn't count for much when they surrendered a one-goal lead to Fulham. A few days later, Grimsby Town dumped United out of the Carabao Cup second round, winning 12-11 on penalties.",
      "Burnley almost piled on the misery, but Bruno Fernandes stepped up in stoppage time and fired the Reds to their first win of the campaign. The 30-year-old midfielder beat Martin Dubravka from 12 yards and took some weight off his boss' shoulders.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Despite defeating the newly-promoted outfit, Amorim still faces a somewhat uncertain future at United. Speaking to Football Insider, Mick Brown, who previously worked alongside Sir Alex Ferguson at the Reds as chief scout, claimed the result wouldn't have changed the mood in the boardroom.",
      "\"A win is a win, at the end of the day,\" said Brown. \"But I don’t think anybody will take confidence in the manager from a 3-2 win when you’ve dominated the game and end up relying on a penalty in the last minute.",
      "\"It’s not the type of result which makes you think they’ll be able to build on it. That is what he needs to do; he needs to put a string of results together and maintain their form.\"",
      "\"They need to continue winning games, that’s how you ease the pressure,\" added the former United official. Amorim may be under pressure to turn things around, but Brown doesn't believe the Portuguese head coach will be sacked if he loses to City and Chelsea.",
      "The Reds will face Pep Guardiola's side at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, September 14, before hosting the Club World Cup champions at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 20. United are currently ninth in the Premier League after three games.",
      "\"After the international break, it’s Man City and then they’ve got Chelsea after that, so it won’t get easier,\" Brown said. \"It’s very easy to start the season and before you know where you are, you’ve lost three or four games and all of a sudden you’re tumbling down the table.",
      "\"At the moment, he’s just papering over the cracks, but a win against Burnley isn’t enough to convince people you’ve turned a corner. Those Man City and Chelsea games are going to be big for him.",
      "\"I don’t necessarily think they’ll sack him even if he loses those games, because at this point it’s to be expected, but more questions will be asked.\"",

      "Manchester United ended up having a rather busy end to the summer transfer window, and there is still the potential for more business to come.",
      "United completed the signing of goalkeeper Senne Lammens on a permanent deal from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day. The 23-year-old arrived at Old Trafford after the Reds agreed an £18.2million deal (plus add-ons) to bring the shot-stopper to the club.",
      "Lammens' arrival has since led to speculation around the futures of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir. Onana has been heavily linked with a move away from United all summer, and recent days have seen those rumours intensify.",
      "A loan deal with Trabzonspor is reportedly on the cards for Onana, with the transfer window in Turkey not closing until September 12 (Friday). A fresh report from The Mirror has provided some insight into United's recent transfer decisions.",
      "The report claims that United decided to go all-in on signing Lammens following the club's defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. It has been claimed that Onana's performance in the second-round tie led to United deciding to bring in a new goalkeeper.",
      "Onana is yet to feature in the Premier League for United so far this season and it remains to be seen if the Cameroon international will play again for the Reds this term in the top flight. Ruben Amorim has selected Bayindir in the first three top-flight fixtures this season and could turn to Lammens now that the Belgium Under-21 international is part of the squad.",

However, the transfer window remains open in Turkey until September 12 (Friday), and it seems that the goalkeeper is set to complete a switch to the Super Lig in the coming days.",

The Reds completed a deal worth an initial £18.2 million for the shot-stopper from Royal Antwerp, a move which, in turn, is seemingly allowing Onana to leave Old Trafford this month.",

Ruben Amorim will be banking on the 23-year-old, who boasted the highest number of clean sheets in the Belgian Pro League last season, to make an immediate impact for United.",

      "There have been a lot of changes at Manchester United over the last few months, and it seems that another one may be coming soon.",
      "Throughout the summer there has been uncertainty and speculation over Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping options. An injury to Andre Onana saw him miss a chunk of pre-season, with Altay Bayindir replacing him between the sticks.",
      "Despite Onana recovering in time for the new season, Amorim opted to stick with Bayindir. Onana’s only appearance so far this season has come in the Carabao Cup third-round defeat against League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "The deadline day signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is only likely to push Onana further down the pecking order. Despite the signing, United weren’t expecting any deadline day departures from their goalkeeping department.",
      "However, things could now be set to change. With the window in Turkey remaining open, it’s reported that United have reached a loan agreement that will see Onana spend the season with Trabzonspor.",
      "If the player agrees to the move, then it will leave United with three senior goalkeepers to choose from for the Manchester derby when the Premier League returns next weekend. While Tom Heaton is expected to be third choice, Amorim will still have a decision to make over who starts in goal, and it’s not an easy one.",
      "The shirt so far has been Bayindir’s, but it’s probably fair to say that he has struggled. The goalkeeper made a mistake for the only goal of the game in the opening day loss against Arsenal and has looked vulnerable anytime the ball comes into the box, especially from set-pieces.",
      "That, in turn, has probably impacted the confidence of the defence in front of him, resulting in panicked clearances and more mistakes. It’s not an ideal scenario going into a game at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "However, if Amorim does take the decision to take him out of the firing line, it may be somewhat of a risk to put Lammens straight in, just a matter of days after completing a move to Old Trafford.",
      "At just 23, he is still very young in terms of a goalkeeper. He has only had one full season of first-team football with Royal Antwerp, becoming first choice for the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The average home attendance for Royal Antwerp is around 12,500. For a young goalkeeper to go from that to the cauldron and the pressure of a Manchester derby would be a big leap.",
      "He could, of course, flourish under the pressure and help reinstall the confidence of the defence. But it could also go the other way; with goalkeepers, mistakes happen, but they’re more likely to do so with a young goalkeeper under pressure.",
      "The decision Amorim now has to make is if it’s a risk he’s willing to take. Or does he stick with out-of-form Bayindir and slowly integrate Lammens over the next few weeks and months?",

      "Ruben Amorim's side concluded a deal for Senne Lammens on deadline day to supplement moves for attacking pair Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and teenage prospect Diego Leon.",
      "United also managed to move out the majority of their unwanted senior stars, with Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho securing loan moves to Barcelona and Aston Villa, respectively, while Antony joined Real Betis and Alejandro Garnacho departed for Chelsea.",
      "Tyrell Malacia does remain at Old Trafford, but he could still depart with the transfer windows in Turkey and Saudi Arabia remaining open.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the Under-21s will play Tamworth in a rearranged fixture in December.",
      "Last month, the U21s visited Tamworth for their opening National League Cup game, but the fixture was abandoned due to a head injury sustained by Sekou Kone in the first half.",
      "Kone was taken to hospital and the fixture was abandoned with no replacement ambulance available. The midfielder stayed in hospital overnight but was discharged in the morning to recover at home.",
      "Neither side had scored at the time of the abandonment. It's understood the fixture has been difficult to rearrange due to conflicting schedules, but an agreement has been reached to meet again on Tuesday, December 16.",
      "The new date means United's opening group-stage game in the National League Cup will now be against Brackley on Tuesday, September 16.",
      "Shortly after the fixture was abandoned, United released a statement saying: \"Manchester United's game at Tamworth was abandoned close to the end of the first half.",
      "\"The tie was halted due to a head injury suffered by Reds midfielder Sekou Kone, inside his own box, and the youngster was taken off on a stretcher.",
      "\"We can confirm Sekou is conscious, stable and communicating with United’s medical team. He has been taken to hospital, as a precaution, for further checks.",
      "\"Everybody at the club wishes him a speedy recovery.\"",
      "Kone was making his first competitive appearance of the season against Tamworth. Ruben Amorim named Kone in the USA pre-season tour squad this summer, but the youngster didn't make an appearance.",
      "Amorim named Kone in three Premier League matchday squads last season - against Tottenham, Everton and Nottingham Forest - but the youngster is still waiting to make his senior debut.",
      "Kone signed from Malian club Guidars FC for around £1million last summer.",

      "Manchester United's Premier League campaign is just three matches old and already there are concerns starting to come to light regarding injuries.",
      "The Reds have started the season with a mixed bag of results. United's Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town was undoubtedly the low point of the opening fixtures, but there have been signs of encouragement following the victory over Burnley and even in the defeat to Arsenal.",
      "When the Premier League returns a week on Sunday for United, all eyes will be on Ruben Amorim as they travel to Manchester City for the derby. A replica of the result from last season will do the Portuguese head coach wonders, but if he is to do that, he may have to do it without some of his key players.",
      "One star who is a huge concern for the game against City is Lisandro Martinez. The Argentine has been sidelined since February with injury, and while he is back on the grass at Carrington, it is unlikely that he will be able to come straight back into the starting line-up.",
      "Martinez, should he return against Pep Guardiola's team, will likely have to settle for a place among the substitutes. As for his defensive partner Diogo Dalot, he has become a fresh concern for United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The full-back has withdrawn from the Portugal squad recently due to a 'muscle discomfort'. United will be hoping this is merely a precautionary measure but could call upon Patrick Dorgu to fill in on the left were he to be out of the derby.",
      "Mason Mount hobbled off against City the last time United travelled to the Etihad Stadium and he could miss the side that faces them this time around after playing '30 minutes' with an injury against Burnley. His issue does not appear to be too serious and the hope is that he can at least make the bench.",
      "Finally, United will be holding their breath on Matheus Cunha. Despite having not scored for the club yet, the Brazilian has been a near-constant threat for the Reds, so it was a concern when he looked to have picked up a hamstring issue against the Clarets.",
      "Cunha has since taken to Instagram to suggest that he will be 'back soon'. However, it is unclear whether this means his return shall be swift for the City fixture or not.",

      "The transfer window is due to reopen on New Year's Day, and Manchester United may well look to return to the negotiating table for some of the names they were linked with this summer.",
      "United welcomed five new players; Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon. Although signing a new midfielder was also on the agenda - with Carlos Baleba under consideration - Brighton & Hove Albion's valuation of over £100million forced the club to potentially put that approach on hold until next summer.",

      "Here, we take a look at the latest headlines and gossip from in and around Old Trafford;",
      "Despite being heavily linked with a move to United, journalist Fabrizio Romano reckons Angelo Stiller was \"never close\" to leaving Stuttgart this summer. Real Madrid were also linked with his services, but apparently the Spanish giants \"never agreed\" personal terms.",
      "The same was said for United, but the midfielder is still believed to be open to a move abroad.",
      "United blocked Kobbie Mainoo from securing a move away during the transfer window, despite the youngster requesting a loan to gain more game time this season. According to The Daily Mail, three Premier League clubs - Tottenham, Aston Villa, and Everton - attempted to sign Mainoo.",
      "Meanwhile, Italian sides Napoli and Roma, as well as French team Marseille, also expressed an interest. However, Amorim was keen to retain the 20-year-old following injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",

      "The 26-year-old, who joined from Brentford in the summer for a deal that could rise to £71million, has scored in each of his last two games for United.",
      "Having scored 20 Premier League goals for the Bees last season, Mbeumo was brought in, alongside Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, to cure United's goalscoring woes from last term.",
      "So far, so good, for the Cameroon international.",
      "Starting on the right hand side of United's front three, Mbeumo has improved the team's pressing from the front and found the back of the net against Grimsby and Burnley.",
      "Ahead of next Sunday's Manchester derby, the former Troyes forward is arguably United's biggest goalscoring threat they will bring to the Etihad.",
      "As well as scoring goals, though, Mbeumo's assist record at Brentford was equally as good.",
      "Last season he registered nine assists in all competitions following on from seven in both 2023/24 and 2021/22, eight in 2022/23 and 12 in 2020/21 - the season Brentford were promoted to the Premier League.",
      "While he is yet to register an assist for United, he was at his creative best for Cameroon on Thursday as he helped the Indomitable Lions beat Eswatini 3-0 in their World Cup qualifier in Yaounde.",
      "Mbeumo created both of Cameroon's first two goals. The first was an excellent inswinging cross from the right-hand side which forced Eswatini defender Gift Gamedze to divert the ball into his own net.",
      "The second assist was almost identical, although this time his inswinging delivery was met by the head of Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to double their lead.",
      "The win left Cameroon one point adrift of group leaders Cape Verde with three matches remaining in the race to qualify for next year's World Cup.",
      "Yes, 155th world ranked nation Eswatini isn't an indicator of the level of opposition Mbeumo will come up against in the Premier League but it serves as a reminder of what else he will bring to United other than goals.",

      "However, the match has officially been called off as 10:23am on the morning of, because the coach carrying Luxembourg's players to the Stade du Moustoir in Lorient, western France, was involved in a traffic accident on Thursday.",

      "It read: \"Following the bus accident that affected the Luxembourg Espoirs team on Thursday evening after their training session, UEFA has decided, by mutual agreement with the two teams, to postpone the match scheduled for this evening (6:30pm CET) at the Allainmat / Le Moustoir stadium in Lorient.",
      "\"This match will be rescheduled for October 3, 2026, in a venue yet to be determined.\"",
      "From United's perspective, the silver lining of this unfortunate situation is that Yoro will not be playing during the September international break. The fixture against Luxembourg was France U21s' only scheduled meeting this month.",
      "It means the 19-year-old should be able to return to Old Trafford with a clean bill of health, avoiding any risk of injury through playing, and therefore ready to continue under Ruben Amorim where he left off.",

      "That, of course, can be heavily caveated by the fact he is yet to start in the Premier League and has accumulated just 80 minutes of action across United's opening three league games.",

      "Garnacho was heavily linked with Chelsea before he finally got his move to Stamford Bridge towards the end of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The flashy winger was deemed surplus to requirements at Man Utd after he fell out with head coach Ruben Amorim last season. He was part of their so-called ‘bomb squad’, which also included Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford.",

      "“£40 million is all profit for United, so they’ve done okay on the balance sheet with that. But I don’t know why they didn’t stick with him. Obviously there was a falling out there with Amorim.",
      "“Look, he’s a talent and I think he’s going to do well in the Chelsea set up. So I think Chelsea have stolen one again. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him move on for £70m/£80m at the end of next season.",
      "“Chelsea will be able to sell him on, having used him well this season, or next season as well.",
      "“So I expect that to be good business for Chelsea and they’ve had a fantastic window in terms of finances as well. So full kudos to them on that one.”",

      "“They made a call for Antony to understand the situation with Betis. They were interested in the situation of Antony, but it was never a permanent transfer.",

      "“At the moment the four players competing in central midfield are Jordan [Henderson], Declan [Rice], Elliot [Anderson] and Ruben [Loftus-Cheek]. They are all very mobile players and there is not one deep number six, maybe John Stones but he left this morning.”",
      "What an extraordinarily depressing quote that is, and for so many reasons. The way in which Thomas Tuchel breezes through several dispiriting barriers to England winning the World Cup next summer in the space of two sentences is almost impressive.",
      "We’re not done with anger yet in the five stages of grief at Henderson being selected again, so we’re a ways off accepting he’s genuinely competing for a midfield spot and yet, when you look at the alternatives, we wouldn’t be at all surprised to see him starting against Andorra on Saturday.",
      "We would much rather see Anderson or Loftus-Cheek alongside Rice, but with this being the former’s first call-up and the latter’s first for nearly seven years, we’re prepared for Hendo doing his shouty thing and plenty of finger-pointing while displaying that all-important trait: mobility.",
      "Quite apart from questioning whether a 35-year-old can even be counted in a class of “very mobile players”, it’s hardly the exciting midfield characteristic one would hope is being picked out by the manager of one of the best international teams in the world as being key to success. “Wow, did you see how mobile he was there?” Jesus.",
      "And why is there “not one deep number six”, Thomas? England need one. Obviously. Every football team in the world has one. England are not going to win the World Cup without one. So don’t replace an injured Adam Wharton – surely the best bet to fill that gap as things stand – with Loftus-Cheek. It makes no sense.",
      "What about Angel Gomes? He’s starting in midfield for Marseille and was arguably the standout player of Lee Carsley’s caretaker reign. Archie Gray, maybe? It doesn’t really matter. This is the first of three international breaks before the World Cup and England need to be playing games of football with a No.6.",
      "And no, not John Stones. Why would you look to fix England’s biggest problem by weakening its second biggest? All things being equal, it should be Stones and Marc Guehi as the Three Lions centre-back pairing. Again, obviously.",
      "Tuchel could do with a midfield bolt from the blue. Someone to come from nowhere to provide a solution; to vie with Wharton for that starting spot which he looks very much on course to merit but will also be his by default.",
      "Ruben Amorim could do England, himself, Manchester United and Kobbie Mainoo a massive favour in one fell swoop.",
      "He desperately needs a partner for Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro is no longer up to it and Manuel Ugarte is yet to show himself capable while offering very little hope of that ever being the case. Mainoo meanwhile continues to be told that his only option of breaking into the first team is through ousting captain and talisman Fernandes. But why?",
      "He’s a 20-year-old footballer who is by all accounts a hard-working professional who’s very clearly desperate to be playing football this season in order to go to the World Cup this summer.",
      "We can think of no individual more open to being coached (imagine that?) into playing a slightly different role which would see him play every game for club and ensure his place in the England squad next summer. There’s literally no downside.",

      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Ruben Amorim remains under fire at Man Utd and there are signs that the pressure is getting the better of him as the inexperienced head coach is running out of allies.",
      "A supposed transformative summer transfer window does not appear to have made much, if any, difference. There are the same problems at Man Utd, who are just as toothless in attack and easy to play through despite investing £230m on signings and ridding themselves of some deadwood.",
      "Amorim’s bullish insistence on sticking with his failing 3-4-3 formation continues to limit Man Utd, with his refusal to adapt, a la Ange Postecoglou, likely to be a key factor in his eventual downfall, which could be sooner than most expected.",
      "There is yet to be evidence of a Man Utd player performing better in Amorim’s formation than previous set-ups, with Kobbie Mainoo among the most high-profile victims of the head coach’s appointment.",
      "Mainoo has gone from legitimately being one of the best prospects in the world to a benchwarmer for a very poor Man Utd side, with Amorim a main contributor to the Premier League giants not seeing the best of the England international for many months.",
      "Man Utd supporters were glad that common sense prevailed in the final week of the transfer window as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. swiftly shut down Mainoo’s hopes of leaving on loan to secure regular game time ahead of next year’s World Cup, with his positive standing highlighted in a GiveMeSport article on the club’s midfield situation.",
      "The report claims ‘United have made a significant U-turn as internal discussions with Mainoo have resulted in him being increasingly confident that he can become a key part of Amorim’s plans’, while ‘there have been indications that they would be more keen to sell Bruno Fernandes’.",
      "Within a day of this revelation, a contrary report from Football Transfers claimed that Amorim was ‘left furious’ that Man Utd’s clear verdict on Mainoo prevented a late-window move for Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher.",
      "Would Gallagher have been a solid addition as a last resort? Yes, probably. But Amorim’s stance, both reported and public, does expose his carelessness regarding a Man Utd player with a higher ceiling than most in their current squad, who should be among the head coach’s main priorities.",
      "Amorim should be doing all he can to make Mainoo a vital component in his team, and it says a lot about the head coach’s position that club chiefs appear to have given Mainoo such a level of internal backing.",
      "Integrating Mainoo would be made easier had they cashed in on Fernandes when £100m from the Saudi Pro League was on the table in the summer, with Man Utd’s ‘willingness to sell’ (as per GiveMeSport) suggesting they already regret doing what they could to retain their club captain’s services instead of ushering him to the exit door.",
      "There’s no doubting Fernandes’ quality and he was easily Man Utd’s best player last season, but his early-season struggles from a deeper position has made it clear that the club’s decision not to maximise his value and use the profit to make the game-changing signing of a top-tier No.6 (E.g. Carlos Baleba) was a huge mistake that will hold them back for at least another year.",
      "READ NEXT: If Mainoo ‘doesn’t like’ Amorim who can blame him? Man Utd boss is clearly ‘the problem’",

      "How good is Senne Lammens?",
      "The stats suggest the new Manchester United goalkeeper knows his way around a six-yard box. And the YouTube compilations will tell you whatever you want to be told.",
      "So the short answer: f*** knows.",
      "Unless you’re an avid watcher of the Jupiler Pro League, then you will know as little as we do. And it’s ok to admit that you’ve never seen Lammens play and that until quite recently, you had never heard of the 23-year-old.",
      "There may come a day very soon that you will long for those times of blissful ignorance. Because Lammens is set to have every catch, kick, fumble and twitch scrutinised from every angle when he assumes responsibility for the ‘hardest job in football’.",
      "When he takes his place in the Old Trafford goal, United fans just need to hope that the recruitment figures at Old Trafford have thoroughly done their homework on Lammens. And that they have finally learned how to pick a goalkeeper.",
      "United will have seen the same stats we have – and reams more – that suggest Lammens is a very good goalkeeper indeed. In the Belgian Pro League.",
      "Last season, for Royal Antwerp, he conceded 32 goals, whereas xG tells us he ought to have been beaten 44.5 times. Not accounting for two own goals – one of which was scored by Lammens himself – the numbers suggest he conceded 0.5 goals per game fewer than expected.",
      "In that metric, he is unmatched in Europe’s top five leagues. None of which he was playing in, of course. But even accounting for the level, it’s a very impressive claim.",
      "He made a few of those last season. Lammens stopped 11.2% of the crosses swung into Antwerp’s box. Only six keepers in the top five European leagues were more effective. For comparison, Andre Onana stopped 5.4% of the crosses in his vicinity – half the number Lammens managed in two more matches.",
      "The stats paint a picture of a very competent goalkeeper, a ‘strong all-rounder’ as Lammens described himself this week, and that would make a very welcome change for United fans, their nerves frayed by watching Onana shamble around their goal for two seasons. And when he was finally replaced, in came Altay Bayindir, who seemingly reached the highest level having never had to face a corner-kick before.",
      "United, hopefully – we make no assumptions of them these days – have dug a little deeper on Lammens, though. Because nothing on a spreadsheet can tell them or us how the 23-year-old will cope with the step up and the spotlight about to shine upon him.",
      "In that respect, United’s decision to opt for Lammens over Emiliano Martinez remains a surprise. Martinez, outwardly, possesses more confidence than is healthy for a functioning adult in society, but an ideal level of self-belief for an elite goalkeeper. United’s keeper concerns down the years have generally been solved by experience and the simple answer to their current problems would have been someone with Martinez’s CV and presence.",
      "No question, this is a gamble for United. Going for a much younger, inexperienced, unproven option carries huge risk for the reward of a stable presence in their nets.",
      "Even if that’s what Lammens proves to be in the long term, things will almost certainly get dicey in the meantime.",
      "David De Gea was younger and had to grow into his United shirt – literally and metaphorically – when he arrived in 2012, but Sir Alex Ferguson saw something worth persevering with during a rotten 18 months at the start of his career at Old Trafford.",
      "Would De Gea have been afforded that settling-in period in today’s climate? Very unlikely. He was fortunate to be part of a very fine team while being shielded by the sheer force of Fergie. Lammens will enjoy the benefit of neither of those things, or anything even close.",
      "When he makes mistakes – he will because all goalkeepers do; the best just keep them to an absolute minimum – Lammens will be ridiculed, mocked and written off by a wider public that never tires of rejoicing in the Red Devils’ misery.",
      "But in between the inevitable misjudgements, if he can rise above the pathetically low bar the current keepers have set, then United have to show more resolve than we suspect they possess while allowing Lammens the necessary time to develop into the keeper they apparently feel he can become.",
      "Newcastle and Liverpool have already shown loyalty doesn’t work both ways. There is love – not – for Lee Dixon and have Chelsea cracked the transfer market?",
      "An England debutant has definitely solved their midfield problem and there are a few Arsenal fans who should be petitioned to apologise to Noni Madueke.",
      "*Former* Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson was a huge plus for Thomas Tuchel vs Andorra in the search for a solution to England’s biggest problem ahead of the World Cup.",
      "England will be aware of the similar situations involving Liverpool forward Rio Ngumoha and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal in the ongoing eligibility battle.",
      "Man Utd have been told by Ben Foster that they made a “panic buy” on the deadline day when they brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "It’s been a long old week of net spend chat and ‘This Means More’ self-love so we have banned net spend from this Mailbox."

      "We’ve ranked the 20 best Premier League players under the age of 21, as of September 4. Trust us, it wasn’t easy.",
      "The sheer volume of young talent in the league is outrageous. At one point we considered limiting it to teenagers, but that wasn’t the plan. Still, whittling it down to just 20 has been a migraine-inducing task, and some brilliant prospects have inevitably been left out.",
      "Our first draft was ridiculous; 39 names made the cut initially. Back then, Burnley, Wolves, Leeds United, Aston Villa, and Nottingham Forest were the only clubs without a representative. By the time we trimmed the list down, Bournemouth, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Sunderland joined them among the Premier League’s youth-neglecting b**tards.",
      "Since we dropped nearly as many players as we kept, we’ll throw in honourable mentions right up until first place (in no particular order). Just to give ourselves extra work. But everything we do, we do it for you.",
      "It’s tough to avoid a so-called ‘Big Six’ bias with lists like this. The best teams usually have the best players: young, prime, or old. That doesn’t mean every talented youngster starts at a big club, but the food chain tends to funnel them there sooner or later.",
      "This is a combination of the best players ranked in terms of ability, but it’s also a bit of a ‘players to watch’ feature. Talent-wise, you might argue that Rio Ngumoha and Max Dowman are shoo-ins, but we’re not convinced they’ll actually start a league game in 2025/26. There’s no need for those two to be added as honourable mentions then. Lovely.",
      "",
      "Signed from Slavia Prague for £19million this summer, Diouf has played every minute for West Ham so far this season. He’s registered an assist in each of his last two appearances, helping the Hammers earn their first win of 2025/26 at Nottingham Forest on matchday three.",
      "Honourable mention: Oliver Scarles (West Ham United)",
      "",
      "From one wing-back to another, we’ve seen Diouf play in a back four already, but every time Dorgu has started for United, it’s been in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. After costing around £25m, there are high expectations for the 20-year-old. We’re yet to be convinced, but he does seem well-suited to the wing-back role. It’s hard to judge any player while playing in Amorim’s dysfunctional system, to be fair.",
      "Honourable mention: Chido Obi (Manchester United)",
      "",
      "Brighton completed the signing of Tzimas in February, allowing the striker to stay at FC Nuremberg in Bundesliga 2 for the rest of 2024/25. He scored 12 goals in 24 league appearances last term and made a significant impact on his Albion debut, registering two goals and one assist in 24 minutes off the bench at Oxford United in a 6-0 Carabao Cup second round win.",
      "Honourable mention: Charalampos Kostoulas (Brighton & Hove Albion)",
      "",
      "Injuries curtailed Odobert’s debut season in north London, but he’s come off the bench in three out of three league games this term. The Frenchman is an exciting winger, as shown in his first few appearances under Ange Postecoglou. After improving Kevin Schade’s game at Brentford, you’d back Thomas Frank to get Odobert flying. Not literally, obviously.",
      "Honourable mention: Ben Gannon Doak (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "MORE FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Why the five post-Fergie Man Utd managers before Amorim were sacked\n👉 Are we seeing the return of the big man up top? Giants incoming this summer…\n👉 Chiesa has Liverpool fans, a goal and Rio Ngumoha to blame for second huge mistake",
      "",
      "Chelsea have a top talent in versatile defender Acheampong, yet without an injury to Levi Colwill, he’d have likely been sold in the summer transfer window. The 19-year-old can play right-back, left-back and centre-back, and started on matchday one against Crystal Palace, helping the Blues keep a clean sheet. He’s been an unused substitute in the other two fixtures, and even with Colwill out for the best part of a year, we fear for his game time across the campaign.",
      "Honourable mention: Tyrique George (Chelsea)",
      "",
      "Leoni’s chances of playing this season are higher after Liverpool failed to capture Marc Guehi. Possibly the only person to benefit from that transfer falling through, the young Italian will be waiting for Ibrahima Konate’s inevitable injury to take his chance.",
      "Honourable mention: Alex Jimenez (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "",
      "We’ve already seen a lot of young Hinshelwood; 52 times in the Premier League, to be exact. The 20-year-old is naturally a defensive midfielder, but has played a lot of his senior football in defence. His versatility is astonishing, starting up front and scoring a brace against Spurs on the final day of last season. Hinshelwood has seven goal involvements in his last 13 top-flight appearances. He’s a serious talent.",
      "Honourable mention: Tom Watson (Brighton & Hove Albion)",
      "",
      "Gray was milked dry by Postecoglou in 24/25, playing here, there and everywhere as Tottenham finished a dismal 17th in the Premier League, but won the Europa League. There’s no doubting Gray’s ability and he is another player you’d back to thrive under Frank, who wanted to bring the ex-Leeds United teenager to Brentford before he moved to Spurs in 2024.",
      "Honourable mention: Chris Rigg (Sunderland)",
      "",
      "Did you know: O’Reilly scored 21 goals and made 17 assists in 26 matches for Man City’s Under-21 side. As has been the case with several young midfielders breaking through, he has been restricted mainly to full-back appearances in the first team, but he has done very well with those opportunities. O’Reilly really grew into that role last season and will have been disappointed to see Rayan Ait-Nouri join, because he’ll be very difficult to dislodge from left-back.",
      "Honourable mention: Lewis Miley (Newcastle United)",
      "",
      "We’re yet to see why Tel is so highly rated, but he is a top talent, and we’re not just saying that because of his Football Manager potential. The 20-year-old only has three goals in 23 matches since leaving Bayern Munich. Come on, fella, don’t make us look silly.",
      "Honourable mention: Eli Kroupi (AFC Bournemouth)",
      "",
      "Lewis broke into an unmovable force of a Man City side as a teenager and his reputation has somewhat declined as City’s performances as a team took a nosedive. Regardless, we’re not writing him off. Nottingham Forest tried to sign him last month and Pep Guardiola’s side responded by offering him a new contract. After the Spanish manager didn’t sign a right-back in the summer, there’s a great opportunity for Lewis to re-stake a claim.",
      "Honourable mention: Eliezer Mayenda (Sunderland)",
      "",
      "Yoro is another young Frenchman yet to show us why he’s been deemed a wonderkid, but like Tel, he’s been showcasing his immense talent in a shambolic football team. Spurs are showing signs of competence, while United still look a mess under Amorim. That doesn’t stop us from rating Yoro and backing him to have a grand career. Probably at Real Madrid.",
      "Honourable mention: Ayden Heaven (Manchester United)",
      "",
      "A supreme talent, Dibling was signed by Everton for around £40m following Southampton’s relegation. We say that as if he didn’t leave until August 25. It’s probably unhealthy how much I like Dibling considering he’s 11 years my junior, but he’s an extremely exciting player. The Toffees have got themselves a gem. It’s quite surprising that there wasn’t more interest in the summer.",
      "Honourable mention: Romain Esse (Crystal Palace)",
      "",
      "Arsenal’s new starboy might already be behind Max Dowman in the pecking order, though there is a chance Nwaneri has been promised more minutes in midfield than on the right wing, where Dowman came off the bench at Anfield over his fellow Hale End talent. There’s an argument for the 18-year-old to be higher than seventh and out of everyone here, he might have the highest ceiling, but recency bias is kicking in a little.",
      "Honourable mention: Josh King (Fulham)",
      "",
      "Recency bias isn’t kicking in with Hall, who seems to be behind Kieran Trippier in the pecking order after the 34-year-old’s renaissance under Eddie Howe. He should be Howe’s long-term left-back, however, with Tino Livramento, 22, on the right. He proved he’s up to the task with a stellar 2024/25 campaign, but injuries hindered that season and will hopefully stop being a burden for a future England regular.",
      "Honourable mention: Chemsdine Talbi (Sunderland)",
      "",
      "Spurs made FC Barcelona look small to secure Bergvall’s signature in the 2024 winter window, completing the signing in the summer. He played a big role in the club’s Europa League success in May and should be a key player for years to come.",
      "Honourable mention: Noah Sadiki (Sunderland)",
      "",
      "One of the highest-rated young defenders in the world, Hato chose Chelsea’s project in the summer after deciding to leave Ajax. His talent is frightening, and like a few on this list, he is extremely versatile. Capable of playing anywhere in defence, Hato can take Colwill’s spot in centre-back and make it his own.",
      "Honourable mention: Antoni Milambo (Brentford)",
      "",
      "",
      "We are very, very excited about Estevao. It’s fun to see a genuine Brazilian wonderkid winger choose the Premier League over Real Madrid and Barcelona, and now it’s on Chelsea and Enzo Maresca to develop him properly. He shouldn’t play too many minutes, and with Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens also signed this summer, he probably won’t, but Estevao can’t be left to rot on the bench this season. His full debut against West Ham gave us a glimpse of Estevao’s talent, and we’re looking forward to seeing him grow at Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "Eighteen years old. Three England caps. One England goal. Forty-one Arsenal appearances. One Arsenal goal. Two Arsenal assists. Ten Champions League appearances. One s**thouse celebration. What a talent Lewis-Skelly is. The teenager is another midfielder to play left-back in the first team, and no other player on this list has taken to that role quite like him. Lewis-Skelly has world-class potential and might be the perfect inverted left-back for Mikel Arteta’s system. Seriously, what a talent.",
      "Newcastle and Liverpool have already shown loyalty doesn’t work both ways. There is love – not – for Lee Dixon and have Chelsea cracked the transfer market?",
      "An England debutant has definitely solved their midfield problem and there are a few Arsenal fans who should be petitioned to apologise to Noni Madueke.",
      "*Former* Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson was a huge plus for Thomas Tuchel vs Andorra in the search for a solution to England’s biggest problem ahead of the World Cup.",
      "England will be aware of the similar situations involving Liverpool forward Rio Ngumoha and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal in the ongoing eligibility battle.",
      "It’s been a long old week of net spend chat and ‘This Means More’ self-love so we have banned net spend from this Mailbox.",
      "Konsa knows Aston Villa have been hampered by The Rules but doesn’t know why or which rules have thwarted them. No wonder the fans think there’s a conspiracy."

      "According to reports, Manchester United reached an ‘agreement’ over signing Antoine Semenyo in the summer amid ‘interest’ from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd‘s first focus was on overhauling their attack and they invested around £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "United made this a priority as they were toothless in attack last season and Semenyo was mentioned as a potential alternative before they settled on Mbeumo and Cunha as their preferred No.10 targets.",

      "“They even had Amorim take him for a meal in London at the end of the season, so that Amorim could judge his character. Again, similar as to Cunha and Mbeumo.”",
      "Castles has also suggested that issues relating to the fee and salary for Semenyo were behind Man Utd’s failure to land the talented attacker.",

      "“And then, I’m told, Semenyo discovered that the salary he had agreed with Man Utd was going to be less than 70 per cent of what they were prepared to pay Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "“Bournemouth strategically used that to convince the player to sign a new contract until 2030, with the idea that he will spend at least one more season at Bournemouth before moving on to another club.",
      "“Guidance from Man Utd is that they saw Semenyo as an alternative to either Cunha or Mbeumo, but Bournemouth believe that they were prepared to do all three of those deals.”",

      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles return as defending Super Bowl champions after dethroning the Kansas City Chiefs in a 40-22 victory in New Orleans in February, denying Andy Reid's side a third straight championship.",
      "Josh Allen's Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens resume their pursuit of a Super Bowl berth in the face of Kansas City's monopoly on the AFC, while Jayden Daniels leads a new era for the Washington Commanders. The Detroit Lions loom as one of the league's most prolific offenses as the Minnesota Vikings seek to maximise a Championship-calibre roster, while Micah Parsons prepares to alter the NFC entirely after his blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers.",
      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""

      "Premier League clubs spent a record £3.19bn in the summer window; Liverpool and Chelsea broke spending and selling records; clubs targeted Premier League-ready signings; Sunderland had a net spend twice as high as European champions Paris Saint-Germain",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright, Jim Lethem, Joda Burgan, Dominic Ball",
      "Wednesday 3 September 2025 08:54, UK",
      "Premier League clubs spent a combined £3.19bn on signings this summer, smashing the previous record for a single transfer window as they scrambled to strengthen their squads.",
      "Liverpool's move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi collapsed on Deadline Day but they still recorded the highest-spending transfer window by any club in Premier League history.",
      "Their British-record £125m move to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle took their total spend to £446.5m, surpassing the £434.5m spent by Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "The Isak deal ensured Liverpool broke their transfer record twice in one window having already signed Florian Wirtz for £116.5m from Bayer Leverkusen. Having also brought in Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Etkike and Giovanni Leoni, the champions have strengthened their squad comprehensively.",
      "While Liverpool smashed the spending record, Chelsea had a record-breaking summer in terms of sales, becoming the first club to pass the £300m mark as they recouped a total of £314.4m.",
      "The Blues allowed a total of 23 players to leave the club permanently and received fees of £20m or over for nine of them. Their biggest sale was that of Noni Madueke to Arsenal for £52m, followed by that of Joao Felix to Al Nassr for £43.7m.",
      "Other sales included those of Christopher Nkunku, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Djordje Petrovic, which banked Chelsea a combined £90m as they joined AC Milan, Everton and Bournemouth respectively. It should be noted, though, that, of those three, only the sale of Petrovic generated profit relative to his purchase price.",
      "Chelsea's record-breaking sales total does not include the £70.5m obligation included in Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, a sum which will see the club more than double their money on the striker, signed from Villarreal for £30m in 2023.",
      "At the other end of the scale, newly-promoted Leeds were the only Premier League side not to generate any funds through sales.",
      "Both Liverpool and Chelsea spent more than Arsenal but it's the Gunners who come out top in terms of net spend having only recouped £10m in sales compared to Liverpool's £228.1m and Chelsea's record-breaking £314.4m.",
      "Arsenal did manage to trim their squad, with Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Jakub Kiwior, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko joining the list of exits on Deadline Day. But generating funds through sales remains a challenge for the club.",
      "There were expiring contracts in the cases of Thomas Partey, Jorginho and Kieran Tierney, while others were only shipped out on loan. The club will recoup £24m through the obligation in Kiwior's loan to Porto, but that will come next year.",
      "The only money received in sales this summer came from Marquinhos's £2.5m move to Cruzeiro and Nuno Tavares' £7.5m exit to Lazio, leaving them with a table-topping net spend having made eight signings at a cost of £267m.",
      "The books will need to be balanced further down the line.",
      "Another trend this summer was an increase in deals between Premier League clubs. Players with experience of the competition and its unique intensity are increasingly in-demand.",
      "As recently as six seasons ago, intra-Premier League club deals were relatively rare. This summer, though, the money spent on signings between Premier League clubs topped £1bn, up from £788m last year. The pattern of the last eight campaigns suggests the trend will continue as clubs target Premier League-ready additions.",
      "More than 60 per cent of the £3.19bn spent by Premier League clubs this summer went on forwards. There was a huge scramble to add firepower led by the competition's elite sides.",
      "Liverpool added the most expensive forward of the lot with their Deadline Day move for Isak, taking their total spent on forwards to £320.5m having already signed the second and third-most expensive forwards in Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Manchester United also invested heavily in their front line, signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £207m, while Arsenal and Chelsea also went big, with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap among their attacking additions.",
      "The money received by Newcastle for Isak went on Stuttgart's Nick Woltemade and Brentford's Yoanne Wissa, while other eye-catching deals saw Mohammed Kudus move from West Ham to Spurs for £55m and Dango Ouattara go from Bournemouth to Brentford for £42m. West Ham were the only Premier League side not to pay a fee for a forward in the window.",
      "It all added up to an eye-watering combined total.",
      "The scale of the spending by Premier League clubs dwarfed that of clubs in Europe's other major leagues.",
      "Italy's Serie A was the next-highest spending league but its total of £893.8m spent did not come close to the Premier League's £3.19bn.",
      "Spending in the German, Spanish and French leagues was even lower. While Premier League clubs finished with a net spend of £1.4bn, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 registered profits.",
      "In terms of net spend, the highest-spending European clubs were Atletico Madrid, Como and Real Madrid, but their totals of £109.5m, £83m and £80.4m respectively were only comparable to mid-ranking Premier League teams.",
      "Incredibly, newly-promoted Sunderland had a net spend more than twice as high as that of Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain's £64.9m, at £141.4m.",
      "The numbers underline the widening financial gulf between Premier League clubs and their European counterparts.",
      "Where did your club get stronger or weaker? Last week, Between the Lines broke down net spending figures by position to show the impact on the transfer window on Premier League teams.",

      "Tuesday 2 September 2025 13:06, UK",
      "Manchester United finally offloaded most of their 'bomb squad' as Antony completed a permanent move to Real Betis, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho joined Napoli and Aston Villa on loan respectively.",
      "The club had begun Transfer Deadline Day with Antony, Hojlund, Sancho and Tyrell Malacia exiled from Ruben Amorim's squad - with only the latter remaining at Old Trafford until January at least.",
      "Antony's return to Betis ended a summer of speculation over whether he would end up back in LaLiga, having spent the second half of last season at the club and racking up seven goal contributions in 17 games.",
      "He joined them for £21.7m, a loss of £64m from when Man Utd paid Ajax £86m for him in 2022.",
      "Jadon Sancho, who had been a target for Roma, joined Villa as one of a number of late additions to Unai Emery's squad, with Rasmus Hojlund making a temporary move, which could become permanent, to Napoli, who have been seeking further striking reinforcements all summer.",
      "Few incomings were expected after Brighton rejected an offer for Carlos Baleba last month, with Senne Lammens the only arrival in an attempt to solve the ongoing goalkeeping issues at Old Trafford.",
      "Andre Onana has not featured for Man Utd in the league all season and was at fault for one of Grimsby's goals in their shock Carabao Cup defeat last week, with Altay Bayindir also faltering in his place in United's opening three Premier League games.",
      "Lammens joined from Royal Antwerp on a five-year deal for a fee of around £18.2m, including add-ons. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez had been discussed, but it was decided internally that Lammens was a better option.",
      "Lammens' skill as a shot-stopper was what impressed the club most; no goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season and he had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe. He also made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "As it stands, United are expected to move forward with four goalkeepers, adding Lammens to their current group of Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton.",

      "Antony had made no secret of his desire to avoid returning to Old Trafford at the end of last season, including a tearful interview while on loan at Betis where he said he had fallen out of love with football at United.",
      "In the end, he got his wish - but he had to wait right up to the end of the transfer window for it to happen. He leaves Old Trafford having played 62 Premier League games across three seasons, but contributed just eight goals and assists.",
      "He arrived at the club in 2022 as one of the major signings of the summer, following former boss Erik ten Hag from Ajax, but never managed to recreate his Eredivisie form for United.",
      "A number of clubs had been interested in bringing in Sancho this summer, including Chelsea, where he spent last season on loan and featured heavily in their run to the Conference League title. But, having failed to agree terms with the Blues, he returned to Old Trafford - and they paid a £5m fine as per the terms of his loan.",

      "Monday 1 September 2025 23:01, UK",

      "\"He's very calm. The mentality is good, I've spoken to goalkeeping coaches and he's been seen as a rising star in Belgium for quite a while.",
      "\"He was at Club Brugge and couldn't get past Simon Mignolet, who was in excellent form. He went to Antwerp, and the number of shots he's saving beyond what the expected goals would expect him to concede has been very, very high.",
      "\"Antwerp have one of the best defensive records in Belgium last season. But it's a huge leap to be the No 1 at Manchester United.",

      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Lammens boasts some striking statistics last season, some simple and others complex. He saved four penalties in the Belgian league, twice as many as anyone else, and his total of 173 saves was the most of any goalkeeper in the top eight leagues.",
      "Given that information, it is perhaps not so surprising that the advanced metrics also suggest he was the outstanding performer. Based on the expected-goals data, he prevented half a goal every 90 minutes - more than any other keeper in Europe.",
      "He has earned a reputation as a ball-playing goalkeeper with a real range of passes at his disposal, although the statistics suggest he is not quite so accustomed to rushing off his line as regularly as some of the more high-profile sweeper-keepers around.",
      "In Belgium, his list of admirers include former national team goalkeepers Michel Preud'homme and Simon Mignolet but the step up to playing for Manchester United will still be a test of technique and temperament for this talented 23-year-old prospect.",
      "\"If your goalkeeper is making mistakes, it undermines everything that you do. And at Old Trafford, it's the most unforgiving ground for goalkeepers.",
      "\"The Manchester United goalkeeper spot is the toughest position in English football, bar none. If you give goals away at United as a keeper, you'll be scrutinised heavily.",
