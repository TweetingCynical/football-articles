      "Manchester United face ANOTHER issue as they attempt to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. The Red Devils have put the forward right at the top of their transfer shortlist as they aim to solve their goalscoring issue.",
      "United have already had two bids turned down to the Cameroonian, with the Bees remaining firm on their £63million valuation. United remain keen on signing him and are hopeful of a deal being complete ahead of their pre-season tour to the USA for the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "But there are some doubts. Tottenham were linked with a move, only for Mbeumo to prioritise a move to Old Trafford.",
      "And now, transfers elsewhere could see United’s chances of signing Mbeumo over the coming weeks dwindle. Nottingham Forest are attempting to sign his teammate Yoanne Wissa this summer having seen their previous attempts fail, with The Athletic revealing that they have lodged a fresh bid for his services.",
      "Forest are pursuing him as a replacement for Anthony Elanga, who is expected to complete a move to Newcastle over the coming days. Should Wissa move to the City Ground, that could see Brentford sharply increase their demands for teammate Mbeumo.",
      "And that could trigger United into ramping up their negotiations in order to get a deal over the line before that. Speaking recently, Brentford director of football Phil Giles denied that a deal was close to being done.",
      "“Let’s see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal’s right, there’s a deal to do, if not then he stays.",
      "“We’ve spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It’s not a given that he’s going to depart this summer. There is interest.",
      "“He had a great season last season so it’s inevitable there’s going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there’s potentially a deal to be done but there’s only so much we can say on that.”",
      "Mbeumo, 25, enjoyed a sensational season for Brentford last term having scored 20 goals in all competitions. As it stands, he has just one year remaining on his current deal in West London.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Whether £50m for Wissa would be good value for money given that he turns 29 in September, is another question however. Daniel Levy and his hierarchy have long turned away from deals for players of that age due to a lack of resale value.",
      "Joining Spurs would appeal to Wissa offering him a taste of European football in its biggest competition. Brentford have fended off interest in him before, with Nottingham Forest already having a £22m bid rejected for him in January.",
      "United will hope Wissa stays put to ensure they stay on track to sign Mbeumo.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim is desperate to overhaul his struggling attack and has already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a bid to aid the problem - with the £62.5m fee paid for the Brazil international increasingly being used by Brentford as a marker for the price tag they've slapped on Mbeumo's head.",

      "Manchester United have been “cheated” over the fees and salaries they have paid players in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, according to an Old Trafford legend.",
      "United have spent in excess of £1.5billion on players and paid exorbitant wages since Ferguson stepped down in 2013 after landing the club's last Premier League title. Since then, United have failed to challenge for the Premier League and ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish since they were relegated in the 1973/74 campaign.",
      "Former United defender Nemanja Vidic reckons his old club have been held to ransom by players who do not have the character to succeed there – but were only too happy to take the money.",
      "Asked if envisaged United not winning the Premier League for 12 years, Vidic said: “No chance. My feeling is that Sir Alex Ferguson left but so did David Gill as well – that’s two big personalities who had been with the club for 25-years.",
      "“They’re difficult to replace and Ed Woodward taking that position, I think was above his knowledge and his capability – that’s my opinion. Obviously, he did fantastic for the club in terms of the marketing and bringing money in, but dealing with agents and players, that role needs someone with experience.",
      "“Even having some ex-footballers around to understand how the players think and how the agent thinks [would have helped]. At the time, the club didn’t help themselves in terms of not bringing in the knowledge of ex-players like Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, or Ryan Giggs – someone who has experienced talking with agents.",
      "“I think sometimes with the salaries and the money we’ve paid to certain players, we’ve been cheated. That for me is the problem. Recruitment is the biggest thing, bringing in good football players, coaches, medical staff, and I think that they should be careful with what kind of people they bring into certain places.",
      "“To be at Manchester United you have to be one of the best in the market, and you have to invest in that – maybe even more than in the players and I think that we haven’t done that well.",
      "“It’s difficult to be at United now, to be a football player or the owner – whatever you do, it’s difficult so if you want to change the club, the club has to bring in the characters. If the characters aren’t in the club, it is difficult, and you will go through this situation.",
      "“If you bring in people who are going to be nice, smiling, and saying things that you want to hear, I don’t think that’s the way forward. You need people who will take responsibility and be strong enough to say the things they see, even if they have to deal with the consequences.”",
      "Vidic, who took his coaching badges while playing for United but who has so far resisted the lure of returning to work in football, claimed players have too much power these days, which makes it even harder for managers.",
      "“Football players have too much power and because of the money involved, the owner respects the opinion of an agent and player more than the manager,” said Vidic. “That’s the issue we have now. If you have a strong character and personality and have a conflict with a player now, I think the coach will be the one to leave the club.",
      "“This is the era of a new generation of a manager who needs to be careful with how they talk to players – to be a psychologist. You cannot treat all players the same, or owners, and fans. Sir Alex Ferguson was great at this, but it’s even more difficult now.”",
      "Nemana Vidic was speaking on The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet",

      "Rio Ferdinand has issued a stark warning to Manchester United's hierarchy, urging them to snap up Bryan Mbeumo this summer or risk embarrassment. The Brentford sensation has been a key target for the Red Devils since the summer transfer window opened up last month.",
      "However, the journey to securing Mbeumo's services has been far from plain sailing, given United have already seen two initial bids for the 25-year-old rebuffed by the Bees after failing to meet their valuation. Now the Old Trafford top brass are set to launch an improved third offer exceeding £60million to finally get a deal over the line - although there's no guarantee Brentford will agree to sell at the new price.",
      "Ferdinand, whose time at United spanned an impressive 12 years from 2002 to 2014, has labelled securing Mbeumo an essential move ahead of the upcoming campaign to stave off potential ridicule. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the ex-defensive stalwart said: \"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United.",
      "\"So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn't seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",
      "\"We haven't heard, really, any other names that it seems to be getting close with. So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant.",
      "\"It's gone public, they've allowed that to happen, and they're in a position now where they've got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.\"",
      "On why Mbeumo is a top fit for the club, Ferdinand added: \"He fits the bill for me physically. He's dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.\"",
      "Regarding Brentford's stance, the club reportedly want at least £65m to let their star winger leave this summer. Director of football Phil Giles has said on the matter: \"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised. He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer. If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Mbeumo had a stellar 2024/25 season with the Bees, netting 20 goals and setting up eight more in 38 Premier League games. As his contract with the club runs until next summer, with an option for Brentford to extend it for another year, the board are not under pressure to sell unless they receive an offer that meets their valuation for the Cameroon international.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

Ratcliffe has been on a crusade to cut costs since taking control of the club in February 2024 and views recruitment as one of the areas that most needs addressing.",
      "Since INEOS took control of the club, there have been a huge number of redundancies across the board – and the scouting department is no exception. The idea is to streamline the previously bloated department by better utilising data, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell at the helm.",
      "Vivell joined in February last year and has won support of the INEOS decision-makers through his work behind the scenes. Director of scouting Steve Brown, who was hired in 2016 by ex-football director John Murtough, has now left the club, with many other scouts following suit.",

By signing him, you’re harming Manchester United, you’re taking a brilliant player away from Brentford, and you make your squad better too. There’s three ways to win by signing him, even though I do think he’ll still go to Manchester United. He’ll be a brilliant signing.\"",

      "Brentford believe they may have undervalued Bryan Mbeumo at £63million after seeing several other offers and valuations around the Premier League with Manchester United still circling for their star man.",
      "The Bees have already rejected two offers for their leading light, who scored 20 times in the top flight last term. The west Londoners have shown themselves willing to sell their top talent, but only once they received the appropriate fee and they've held firm so far.",
      "They want just over £60m before they consider letting Mbeumo leave. United are yet to hit that figure and the Bees could still ask for more after seeing other clubs conducted their transfer activity.",
      "Newcastle have seen a £55m offer for Anthony Elanga accepted by Nottingham Forest. There is also continued talk of a possible switch for Noni Madueke, who could leave Chelsea for Arsenal, but only for more than £50m.",
      "The Evening Standard reports that Brentford have been encouraged by the fees touted for Madueke and Elanga, who both were less productive in the final third last term, which underlines their view that their valuation is not only fair but may even be lower than market value.",
      "Last summer it was Ivan Toney who left Brentford, heading for Saudi Arabia, and Mbeumo stepped up impressively with him gone. The Cameroon international has scored against the Manchester outfit but is now keen to join them in the coming weeks.",
      "Mbeumo has made clear he wants to move to Old Trafford and he would massively benefit financially with his wages skyrocketing if he did make the switch. Brentford have stood firm though and are open to other clubs making offers for their forward as they look to maximise profits.",
      "So far Matheus Cunha is the only new face in arrive on the red side of Manchester and Brentford chief Phil Giles has confessed he can still see a scenario where Mbeumo remains in the capital.",
      "The sporting director said: \"He had a fantastic season. We expected big interest in him, we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",

      "Scott McTominay claims he wants nothing but success for Manchester United after his exit was slammed as a mistake. The Scottish midfielder was sold by the Red Devils last summer as he completed a £25m move to Italian giants Napoli.",
      "His exit brought to an end a two-decade association with the club having progressed through their academy to make over 250 first-team appearances. McTominay’s sale was thought to have been a boost to United’s PSR calculations given any fee they received would have represented pure profit.",
      "Despite the circumstances of his departure, McTominay has said that he does not harbour any ill feelings towards his former club. He said: “I always want the absolute best for Manchester United. It’s been my life for 22, 23 years so for me, I wish the club all the success in the world.",
      "“I’m with them every step of the way. I want them to do well. I’m not someone who doesn’t want that.”",
      "McTominay ended up enjoying a dream debut season in Naples having played a key role in Napoli’s Serie A title success. He made 36 appearances in all competitions, scoring 13 goals.",
      "While the move was certainly a success from McTominay’s point of view, some were not particularly convinced that the decision to sell him was the correct one. Former United coach Benni McCarthy recently slammed his exit.",
      "He said: “There are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes. When they go, the profit lets you sign more players. Having said that, it was one of the biggest mistakes in football to let him leave.",
      "“He was born to play for United. Maybe he wasn’t the most technical, but he had fight, and I think it’s what they will get back with Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be. To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision.",
      "“For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club. People can say what they like but we tried to bring in great players that would fit. I know the manager always takes the blame, but sometimes the club needs to look at itself.”",
      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also a vocal critic of McTominay’s sale. Speaking to the BBC, he said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",

It now appears all but certain Vlahovic will leave Turin in the coming weeks as Juventus prepare to make Vlahovic an offer to rip up his contract.",

      "In March, the Red Devils unveiled images and scaled models of the new stadium which will cost an estimated £2billion and be built by Architecture firm Foster and Partners. Coe, 68, will be the face of the project.",
      "The Mail report that United have appointed the four-time Olympic medallist, who remains the only man to have won gold in the 1500m event twice. Club chiefs want the Red Devils to be in their new home for the start of the 2030-31 season, although there are multiple hurdles to get over first.",
      "United are said to be at loggerheads with a local business over a piece of land which is vital to the project, with new housing, an open cinema and much more part of their plans. The club's progress has been stunted by a failure to come to an agreement over the Freightliner Terminal which is behind the Stretford End.",
      "It's said that landowners Brookfield remain a substantial distance from United in terms of valuation. Coe will be publicly announced as 'Chair-Designate' of the Mayoral Development Corporation for the Old Trafford Regeneration project by Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester.",
      "The ex-Team GB hero had previously led a task force assessing the future of Old Trafford which also featured former United captain Gary Neville, who now owns multiple businesses in Manchester. Coe is also a close friend of Red Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who hopes that the new stadium will be his legacy as well as bringing sustained success back to United.",

      "United are desperate to get rid of Garnacho in the wake of his bust-up with Old Trafford boss Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old is one of five United players told by Amorim to stay away from pre-season training after they requested to leave.",
      "Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia will train away from the main United squad until their futures are resolved. United value Garnacho at £60m, but know they will not get that fee, given his public falling-out with Amorim and the club's desire to offload him.",
      "It is understood United remain in negotiations with Napoli, in the hope of striking a deal with the Italian champions over Garnacho. Napoli want Garnacho to link up with former Manchester City superstar Kevin De Bruyne, who joined them on a free transfer earlier this summer, and former United midfielder Scott McTominay, voted Serie A Player of the Season last term.",

      "\"Obviously it's hard for everyone,\" a clearly disgruntled Garnacho told reporters. \"Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more.",

      "When Manchester United appointed Ruben Amorim as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, few players in the squad stood to benefit more than Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The midfield enforcer, who had joined United from Paris Saint-Germain just over two months earlier, worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, racking up 85 appearances under his stewardship during his time in the Portuguese capital.",
      "Ugarte had arrived at Old Trafford from the Parc des Princes with the task of providing United's midfield with some much-needed defensive nous.",
      "Despite an excellent debut season at United in 2022/23, Casemiro regressed the following season, making the addition of a defensive-minded midfielder a leading priority for the 2024 summer transfer window. United spent several weeks in negotiations with PSG and eventually signed Ugarte on deadline day last August.",
      "After confirming Ugarte's arrival for an initial fee of £42.3million, former United sporting director Dan Ashworth said of the Uruguayan international: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer. He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.",
      "\"His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "Evidence of that was on show in the latter stages of Ten Hag's tenure when he appeared reluctant to select the former Sporting midfielder. He played just seven times under the Dutchman prior to his exit on October 28, making just three starts, of which only one of them was in the Premier League.",
      "It meant the appointment of Amorim felt significant in Ugarte's hopes of nailing down his place in the team. Many anticipated he would join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",
      "Despite playing 34 times between Amorim's arrival and the end of the season, Ugarte's omission from the starting line-up for the Europa League final and the Premier League finale against Aston Villa felt telling.",
      "Casemiro got the nod against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, starting in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes. Ugarte failed to make it off the bench that evening.",
      "Throughout his debut season at Old Trafford, United fans saw the good and the bad of Ugarte. They witnessed how he has the credentials to maintain order in midfield out of possession, helping United keep their shape and win possession back, but they also witnessed flaws in his game when in possession.",
      "Unlike in France and Portugal, Ugarte is not blessed with as much time on the ball in the Premier League. The division is played at a frantic pace and you need eyes in the back of your head.",
      "As a defensive shield and midfield battering ram, Ugarte offers all of the varying qualities you need to fulfil that duty. On the ball, though, he is far from perfect, meaning it is easy to understand why United want to sign a midfielder this summer who can offer a little bit of everything.",
      "However, amid United's desperate need to strengthen their attack, the addition of a midfielder might be put on the back burner.",
      "Fernandes is poised to occupy one of the two No.8 spots and he will need a defensive-minded operator alongside him to ensure United maintain a sense of balance in midfield.",
      "Ugarte is best qualified to offer that defensive nous, but he must raise his game if he is to make one of the two central midfield spots his own. As a result, pre-season will be vitally important for him this summer.",
      "He joined United on August 31 last year, meaning he was thrown in at the deep end. Adjusting to a new club is hard enough, but when you join a club of United's stature, and are tasked with the challenge of fixing the team's biggest weakness, the job becomes even harder.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt this summer, Ugarte should be all the better for it. If he makes the most of it, there is no reason why he cannot reach his best levels under Amorim again."

      "Sporting a Michael Jordan graphic t-shirt, Hojlund will hope that he can embody the Chicago Bulls legend at Old Trafford this season. However, time is of the essence to prove that to his own Phil Jackson - Ruben Amorim.",
      "Last season was one that is best forgotten from Hojlund's perspective. While his performances in the Europa League were manageable, it was the Premier League that proved to be his nemesis.",
      "Hojlund has shown he can score in the English top flight, with his ten in 30 appearances during the Dane's debut campaign being evidence of that. But with all those struggling around him, the 22-year-old wilted as United plummeted.",
      "The rhetoric surrounding the club this summer has been the need to sign a centre-forward. Hojlund has been linked to the exit door to make that happen despite insisting that he expects to stay at United this summer.",
      "Whether he leaves or not, a new centre-forward is certainly needed. Joshua Zirkzee clearly plays better in the No.10 role and even if Amorim is going to persevere with him as a striker, at least one new centre-forward is needed to provide decent cover to the team.",
      "On Friday, there are just 37 days remaining before the start of the Premier League season. Before then, United will face four Premier League opponents and Fiorentina to prepare for that opening day against Arsenal.",

      "Strikers at the top of their games this summer have all been valued around this mark. Ollie Watkins, Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres could all improve United but will cost a king's ransom.",
      "However, if Hojlund proves himself to be capable of being a main striker who can reliably score, a move for a free agent could be seen as viable for Amorim. Signing a player like Callum Wilson or Jamie Vardy could be ideal for United and provide the Dane with a valuable partner to learn from.",
      "But these are all big ifs at the moment. Based on last season, Amorim will feel as though he needs to spend big to strengthen his attack.",

      "In addition to Watkins, Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha were spotted in the comments.",
      "The Reds captain simply responded with a GiF of young David Beckham during his days at the club - potentially referencing Mount's No.7 squad number.",
      "Cunha on the other hand, replied with the index pointing, love heart and fire emojis. The Brazilian completed a £62.5million move to Old Trafford from Wolverhampton Wanderers this summer."

      "Few Manchester United players were spared Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary 'hairdryer' treatment.",
      "The iconic manager's fiery temper was as well-known as his managerial success, with incidents like the flying football boot that injured David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy's dressing-down for swapping shirts after a derby loss.",
      "Yet, it appears some players were exempt from such confrontations. Eric Cantona, despite his infamous kung-fu kick incident at Crystal Palace, seemed to sidestep such disputes.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was also treated delicately by Ferguson, a strategy that seemed to work wonders given Ronaldo's accomplishments at Old Trafford. This softer approach towards certain players may have been influenced by an altercation with Ronaldo, as former club captain Nemanja Vidic, who made 300 appearances for United, suggested. Speaking on The Overlap, Vidic reflected on his time at the club from 2005 to 2014.",
      "\"With the manager, I never had a close relationship,\" he said, via the Express. \"If he asked me something, I would tell him, but I never had that relationship. Rio (Ferdinand) or Darren Fletcher would talk more.\".",
      "Vidic indicated that Ferguson, now 83, recognised that not all players reacted positively to harsh criticism, stating: \"What he realised, it's not that he didn't shout at me because he was scared of anyone, but he realised that with certain players, it would not help if he's shouting.",
      "\"I think he changed that after he shouted at Cristiano Ronaldo. I don't think Ronaldo took it well, maybe good for the English and British players, but he was careful with the foreign players.\"",
      "Ferguson secured 13 Premier League titles throughout his tenure, along with two Champions League trophies and numerous domestic honours. He has certainly maintained Ronaldo's admiration well beyond the Portuguese star's departure for Real Madrid in summer 2009.",
      "The 40-year-old continues to address his former boss as exactly that - \"boss.\" He described Ferguson as a \"father figure\" during his formative years, having arrived at United from Sporting CP at the age of just 18."

      "There have also been persistent rumours that United want to sign a new striker this summer, despite having Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund in their squad. Liam Delap was a player of interest to United earlier in the summer before the centre forward went on to join Chelsea instead.",
      "Reports have now emerged claiming that former Leicester City star Jamie Vardy is a target for United. Vardy is now a free agent after his contract expired at the King Power Stadium at the end of last month, meaning United would be able to sign the striker for free.",
      "However, recent reports have also claimed that Serie A outfit Genoa are also interested in signing Vardy on a free transfer this summer. But it has been claimed by La Repubblica that the Italian club's manager, Patrick Vieira, said 'no' to the transfer.",
      "Vieira has been the manager of Genoa since last November, following his time in charge of Crystal Palace and later having a spell at Strasbourg. During his playing days, the former Arsenal midfielder often went head-to-head with United legend Roy Keane in the middle of the park.",
      "If the report from Italy turns out to be true, it could mean that Vieira has now given United the chance to sign Vardy to solve their striker transfer dilemma. Whether United actually turn out to have a genuine interest in signing Vardy, though, remains to be seen."

A whole host of rumours have already been circling which have claimed to provide updates on the players that are of interest to United.",
      "Matheus Cunha is the only new signing for United, to date, with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo also a target this summer. With United having agreed to pay £62.5million for Cunha, there have already been two bids rejected for Mbeumo, with the latter believed to be worth in excess of £60million.",
      "Away from their own transfer business, it seems one of United's old players could be on the move once again in the near future. Fabrizio Romano has reported that Alvaro Carreras is close to completing a permanent switch to Spanish giants Real Madrid from Benfica.",
      "United sold Carreras to Benfica, last summer, in a deal worth £5million. United also included a sell-in clause in that agreement 12 months ago, although it remains unclear what exact percentage of any future fee they'd be entitled to as and when his switch to Real is formalised.",
      "Reports have speculated that Carreras could be set to join Madrid for €50million (£43million), the value of the left-back's release clause at Benfica. If this was to be the case, United could be entitled to as much as £4.3million with a 10 per cent sell-on clause or £8.6million with 20 per cent.",
      "If United are merely entitled to a percentage of any profit, that would see the figures decrease marginally. A 10 per cent sell-on clause would see United given £3.8million - and a 20 per cent clause would result in a £7.6million bonus for United.",
      "If Carreras does go on to join Madrid and United receive a sell-on clause value, it could be part of a double transfer windfall for the club. Ex-United winger Anthony Elanga is reportedly close to joining Newcastle in a £55million deal.",
      "United sold Elanga to Forest last summer for £15million - but did include a 20 per cent sell-on clause for any future profit. That means United could receive as much as £8million if Elanga does go on to complete a move to St James' Park.",
      "Combined, it's possible that United may receive as much as £16.6million from two deals that don't involve any of their own players. These funds could go a long way to helping the club complete their own transfer business this summer."

      "MEN Sport says:As much as Vardy is a respected figure in English football, having enjoyed a remarkable career with Leicester City, the opportunity for him to join United has passed. At 38 years old, bringing him in, especially on a free transfer, would contradict the club’s current strategy of building a younger, more dynamic squad focused on long-term development.",

      "Storytelling has become one of the areas that football clubs have sought to improve in recent years.",
      "In a competitive marketplace where many major clubs are all jostling to be seen and in the eyes and ears of a global audience, the go-to move has been to create a documentary to allow current and future fans a chance to peek behind the curtain and gain an affinity with the club.",
      "The success of ‘Welcome to Wrexham’, the Disney+ show that has charted the rise of Wrexham under Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney is something many clubs want a slice of, with the popularity of the Welsh side having soared across the Atlantic in the United States and positively impacted revenues to the tune of millions.",
      "Birmingham City, who count NFL legend Tom Brady among their ownership group, will launch their own documentary later this year on Amazon Prime Video, while Amazon’s ‘All or Nothing’ series has been hugely popular in recent years, featuring the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "On Monday it was reported by The Athletic that Manchester United had turned down the opportunity to become the latest stars of the small screen for Amazon, with the call being made to end the talks after boss Ruben Amorim expressed his dissatisfaction.",
      "The report claimed that United executives had been in talks with Amazon for several months with the idea being to produce a documentary on what is set to be a hugely important season for United on the back of their worst in the Premier League era in 2024/25. The money on offer was set to be ‘significantly more’ than £10m and the most money that any team had ever received for an ‘All or Nothing’ documentary.",
      "Despite the on-pitch struggles in recent years for United, the club retains its status as one of the most iconic brands in world sport, and after such a period of tumult, the potential to film what comes next was an enticing prospect to the streaming giant.",
      "In saying no, the club not only misses out on the millions from the deal, but it also reduces its global exposure to audiences at a time when they are going to find themselves out of the European football spotlight. In terms of what that can deliver for the club, it can attract new fans, who build a lifelong connection with the club and become active customers during that period. But the upside wasn’t enough to convince Amorim, and that might not be the worst thing.",
      "By virtue of being Manchester United, every element of what the club does is scrutinised. For Amorim, the 2025/26 season will be one where he has to return the club back to basics to try and address the alarming decline, and for the sake of £15m or £20m, money that could be accrued through player trading, of which United have many saleable assets they can book a profit on, the potential intrusion and impact that may have caused to a squad where plenty have already shown the weight of history and expectation to hang heavy, wasn’t deemed worth the risk.",
      "This was likely a pretty easy no to take for United and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, particularly if it was felt that it would hamper the club’s chances of returning themselves to European football’s elite Champions League group by the end of this season, a feat that would yield far greater financial gains that a documentary would.",
      "But storytelling is only going to become more prevalent, and clubs are going to find more ways to try and find a narrative that has broad appeal, especially as the game continues to become more global and when traditional domestic broadcasting rights are being squeezed.",
      "United know they have reach, that has never been a problem, the issue that they have had for some time is a negative perception of the football club, and that isn’t great for fans, current or future, or commercial partners. The lack of competitive success has come at a time of a succession of PR disasters, such as mass redundancies of non-playing staff in a bid to cut costs.",
      "They will need to present a better image in the coming seasons and it should be no surprise if a documentary forms part of that. But for this coming season, the overriding need for the club to get its house in order behind closed doors and have that reflected through improved performances on the pitch is paramount."

      "And if Amazon had had their way, they would have had every angle covered. Just as they had done with Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in previous years, they wanted to produce an access-all-areas documentary to offer an insight into what goes on behind the scenes at one of the world's biggest sporting institutions.",

      "It has been reported that Amazon's offer 'was significantly more than £10million', meaning United would have banked the largest ever payment for an 'All or Nothing' series.",
      "It is claimed Amorim, who has just embarked on his first pre-season as United head coach, was 'not comfortable with potential intrusion on the first-team'. The documentary would have followed every aspect of the Reds' 2025/26 campaign, meaning team meetings, dressing room exchanges and much, much more would have been under the spotlight.",

On the flip side, however, it would have opened the door for further ridicule if United were to struggle again next season.",
      "Having failed to qualify for next season's Champions League, United have missed out on several important revenue streams. A successful Champions League campaign can be worth more than £100m, factoring in prize money, gate receipts, sponsorship deals and various other means.",
      "As a result of losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as what it would have otherwise been, meaning they are having to box clever in this summer's window. Progress has been slow thus far, reflected in the Reds' tally of just two new arrivals, and player sales are key to funding new additions.",
      "With that in mind, the chance to bank more than £10m would have had United's decision makers licking their lips. Every cash injection, however big or small, will be welcomed with open arms this summer.",
      "However, United find themselves walking a fine line between the financial side and the sporting side of the operation. The club's hierarchy knows Amorim has got to oversee a serious improvement next season and it is evident the Portuguese chief believes his players will have a better chance of helping the club climb the table without a TV crew following their every move.",
      "To have adhered to Amorim's request shows that United's decision makers are in full support of the former Sporting Lisbon boss. They have put plenty of trust in him and this decision only strengthens their case to show they are backing him in every possible way.",
      "Ensuring everyone is on the same page is a strong recipe for success, and it is vital for any head coach to have the backing of those above him in the chain of command.",
      "The fact United's top brass have backed out of a deal that would have brought in much-needed funds, to ensure Amorim is more comfortable with hopefully overseeing a season of progress, can only be considered as a positive on the sporting side of the operation.",
      "Amorim clearly felt the timing was all wrong for a documentary to be manufactured and his concerns have been noted."

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "8) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders but their business might be almost done now.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £96.76m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "They will do so if their deal to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen falls through, but it’s claimed that United ‘remain strongly interested as well’.",

      "They’ve spent over a month working on a deal for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo, submitting two failed bids in the process.",

      "Ornstein, writing for The Athletic, confirms that Forest’s interest in Wissa was revived after their failed winter bid.",
      "They offered £25m in January, only to be rejected. Their ‘fresh offer’, however, is reportedly still below Brentford’s asking price of ‘more than £50 million’.",
      "Forest are in need of attacking reinforcements after agreeing to sell Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, while Tottenham Hotspur, now managed by former Brentford head coach Thomas Frank, have activated the release clause for Morgan Gibbs-White.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Wissa’s contract expires in 2026, but Brentford’s option to extend it until 2027 strengthens their negotiating position.",
      "Wissa was in impressive form last season, scoring 19 goals in the Premier League, helping Brentford finish tenth.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Napoli\nA fake quote from Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has been doing the rounds. Fabrizio Romano says Napoli aren’t interested. So they probably aren’t interested.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nRomano reckons Newcastle are sniffing around the £85million-rated striker, joining a gaggle of clubs that includes Chelsea and Liverpool. Can Newcastle afford Ekitike without selling one of their biggest assets? Almost certainly not.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "16) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nWages are what’s stopping this from happening. Sancho wants around £200,000 and Juve aren’t having it.",
      "",
      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern were looking for a wide forward even before Jamal Musiala’s injury at the Club World Cup. Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",
      "",
      "13) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe noise around this one is increasing by the day, with Madueke perhaps the most achievable left winger target, assuming Eberechi Eze is a separate pursuit. Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and they are expecting an offer from Arsenal. They have received a call, in which the Blues told their London rivals they expect in excess of £50million. Worth it?",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "2) 🆕 Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one is moving fast. Who knew Gibbs-White had a £60m release clause in his contract? Because we sure didn’t. He’s set for a medical on Friday.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has told the club that they have “got to” secure the signing of a Premier League star as they’ve waited “far too long” with no “alternative” in the wings.",
      "United have spent a lot of the last month or so focussing on Bryan Mbeumo. They have already improved the final third with Matheus Cunha, and having Mbeumo in the other No.10 position",
      "United legend Ferdinand feels the saga has been going on too long for United to fail, as he suggested it’s unclear where they’d turn if they didn’t get Mbeumo.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “David Ornstein, who’s a friend of the channel, has reported that he [Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he’s told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford’s valuation.",
      "“I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn’t seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it’s been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn’t happen.",
      "“I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",
      "“We haven’t heard, really, any other names that it seems to be getting close with. So, I’ll be surprised if this deal doesn’t go through, because Man United have been adamant. It’s gone public, they’ve allowed that to happen, and they’re in a position now where they’ve got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.”",
      "Ferdinand is clearly a fan of Mbeumo’s profile, though, stating: “He fits the bill for me physically. He’s dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.”",
      "A recent report suggested United are positive about their chances of landing the Brentford forward before their tour of America.",
      "That begins on July 22, so the Red Devils are ‘confident’ that they’ll have Mbeumo in under two weeks.",
      "Indeed, discussions are continuing and the club feels, though there is currently a gap in valuation between United and Brentford, that they will be able to get their man in time to see him bed in on the tour.",
      "Nottingham Forest have reportedly made a bid for Brentford striker Yoane Wissa, which could have implications for Man Utd’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘confident’ that they will not miss a set deadline as they pursue Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has set a new deadline to complete a deal to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are not sold on their potential deal to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer as “they’re worried” he’s not the “answer”, according to one pundit.",
      "Man Utd transfer target Bryan Mbeumo is ‘growing increasingly frustrated’ at the lack of progress between the Red Devils and Brentford.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price."

      "A Manchester United flop has been told by a broadcaster to return to his old club, as they “love him” as there may not be a chance of “winning something” at a proposed destination.",
      "United have a number of players who they are looking to push out the door this summer. It was recently revealed that Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho had all asked to leave.",
      "For various reasons, it’s unlikely that the club will stand in the way of any of them going.",
      "Sancho has spent the last season and a half out on loan, with Borussia Dortmund and then Chelsea, but the former couldn’t pay his wages permanently, and monetary reasons contributed to the Blues sending him back to United.",
      "He is now being pursued by Juventus, who seem eager to land the winger, if they can finance a deal.",
      "But talkSPORT broadcaster Alan Brazil feels a return to Dortmund – where Sancho scored 50 goals and chipped in with 64 assists in his spell as a permanent player there from 2017 to 2021 – is the best course of action.",
      "“I think he had his best time at Dortmund. If I were him, I’d go there because they love him there, he feels comfortable,” he said.",
      "“Are Juve going to be up there? You want to go there with a chance of winning something.”",
      "But interest from Dortmund is not currently evident, while Juventus are clearly eager to land the winger. Interest from the European giants has been reported for months, and there are various avenues being followed for them to land him.",
      "It has been suggested that there are a couple of potential swap deals in the works, with Juventus pair Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic both separately having been offered to United.",
      "Whether that is the avenue which will land Juventus Sancho remains to be seen, but it seems he’s open to the move.",
      "Reports have suggested that he’s willing to take a pay cut to land in Turin, with a £115,000-per-week (€133,000) contract is being discussed, which would see Sancho’s wage cut by more than half.",
      "It is said he has taken ‘drastic action’ in terms of lowering his demands in order to ensure that move happens.",
      "As a result, it’s stated ‘everyone is waiting’ for him to sign, and all parties are ‘almost at a virtual handshake. Should that happen, a Dortmund return would have to wait, and there’s a distinct chance it never comes.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is ‘closer’ to securing an exit after ‘taking drastic action’ to secure his desired transfer.",
      "Man Utd will welcome any suitor for their band of misfits and here are eight possible reunions which could aid what currently looks like a woefully inadequate summer rebuild.",
      "Former Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bring Jadon Sancho to Besiktas this summer and has made enquiries, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘agreed’ to sell Jadon Sancho to Juventus, but wage demands and transfer terms are proving tricky.",
      "According to reports, the ‘latest development’ at Manchester United has angered four ‘unhappy’ players as INEOS look to cash in on several unwanted talents.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window."

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal is a done deal. Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "Arsenal have announced that they have completed their third summer signing, while Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that another transfer is “absolutely on”.",
      "Arsenal continue to make moves in the summer transfer market with their third signing set to be confirmed this week.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",

      "United have scoured Europe for different striker targets this summer. They know a move for Viktor Gyokeres now won’t be possible, and attempts to land Benjamin Sesko could go the same way.",
      "As such, a move for Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic is being pursued. The Serbian striker cost £67million when Juve signed him in 2022, though it’s recently been suggested that he could be available for as low as £25million.",

      "Juve are eager to get rid of the high wages of Vlahovic, while United just want rid of Sancho in any way possible.",

      "9) Cristhian Mosquera (Valencia)\nAvailable for around £17million, Mosquera is only 21 and out of contract next year, prompting Arsenal to make an offer to sign him this summer. Valencia said no, but personal terms are already in place for the Spaniard to move to the Emirates.",
      "The one-cap Spanish international played in 37 of Valencia’s 38 La Liga matches last season. In the one game he missed, Carlos Corberan’s side lost 7-1 to Barcelona. He probably knew what he was doing with that 94th-minute suspension-clinching yellow card the week before.",
      "Mosquera is one of the most promising central defenders in Europe and it’s no surprise to see Arsenal interested. He’d be outstanding right-footed cover for William Saliba.",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joins Real Madrid.",
      "Still only 21, Silva has played 140 times for Benfica. Extraordinary stuff.",
      "MORE ‘BEST AVAILABLE’ FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Arsenal targets second and third in ranking of the best available strikers this summer\n👉 Best available attacking midfielders: Arsenal-linked Premier League stars in top two\n👉 Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd, Man City outcasts and Spurs captain Son…",
      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often. For my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t prise Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",
      "There’s no real competition for Guehi here, in my opinion. He’s absolutely brilliant. He’s the future of England’s defence and deserves to be playing for a Champions League club.",

      "Including Scandinavian starlets Oscar Bobb and Chido Obi, these 10 Premier League youngsters are ready to go out on loan to a domestic rival this season.",
      "",
      "Oscar Bobb (Manchester City)\nA serious injury robbed Bobb of the chance to establish himself at Man City, and now he’s further down the midfield pecking order than his ability and potential deserve. We can’t think of a Premier League player more in need of a summer loan. He needs to play to realise that incredible potential, which will benefit both City and Norway in the long run.",
      "He’s a special player and needs regular first-team football. There’s a strong chance Pep Guardiola looks abroad. Borussia Dortmund seems an excellent fit, though they’ve just signed Jobe Bellingham, while Bayer Leverkusen could also be an option.",
      "In the Premier League, a mid-table side like Everton, Bournemouth or West Ham would make perfect sense. There’s no doubt Bobb improves those teams, and obviously any of those expected to finish below them. If a newly promoted club like Leeds United manage to get the 21-year-old for the season, they’ll be bloody delighted.",
      "",
      "Tyrique George (Chelsea)\nEvil Saka is a cracking player. Effective on the left, right and even through the middle, the 19-year-old winger could hang around and get insufficient minutes at Stamford Bridge, or get regular minutes elsewhere in the Premier League.",
      "From just 10 starts across all competitions, George has scored three goals and made five assists — a pretty impressive return. He started up front against Manchester United in the Premier League after impressing Enzo Maresca in earlier appearances off the bench.",
      "George would be a real attacking asset for a bottom-half Premier League team; we’re thinking Wolves or Burnley.",

      "The 18-year-old would surely benefit from being as far away as possible from the Old Trafford dumpster fire. They can learn from the Alvaro Carreras mistake by properly developing Amass and ensuring he doesn’t slip through their fingers with measly buy-back options. They really screwed the pooch there, with Carreras off to Real Madrid as the perfect left-wing-back in Xabi Alonso’s system. Ruben Amorim will be raging.",
      "",
      "Mikey Moore (Tottenham)\nA very positive and confident player who’s ready for more minutes than he’s going to get in this Spurs team. It’s maybe a case of quantity over quality, but there’s a lot of competition for places in wide areas, which makes a loan move a sensible option.",
      "Moore is only 17 and someone Spurs rate very, very highly. Loaning him out at such a young age isn’t crucial for his development, but if it goes well, the upside is gargantuan.",
      "",
      "Vitor Reis (Manchester City)\nCity aren’t completely sold on loaning out Reis, just six months after signing him for £30million from Palmeiras. But it does make sense, doesn’t it, lads?",
      "City have so many centre-back options, and if Reis isn’t loaned out, Abdukodir Khusanov surely will be. The players above the two January signings in the pecking order are Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Ruben Dias and Manuel Akanji.",

      "Dario Essugo (Chelsea)\nHopefully this guy isn’t another Lesley Ugochukwu, who Chelsea are desperate to sell after two years and ends up on loan at a historically s**t Premier League team.",
      "Essugo has joined from Sporting for £20m and it’s difficult to envision him getting sufficient minutes in a Chelsea midfield that has several options ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "He spent last season with Las Palmas in La Liga, playing 27 times, and that experience stands him in good stead to consistently feature in a Premier League team next season.",
      "",
      "Chido Obi (Manchester United)\nIt’s anyone’s guess who takes on young Obi, but he has incredible potential and United might view a season of regular first-team football as the best thing for his development. Whatever they decide is best will ultimately turn out to be the worst.",
      "Similarly to Moore, Obi is at an age where it makes sense to keep him around playing youth football and the occasional first-team minutes. But with no Europa League, there won’t be minutes against clubs from Kazakhstan or a Thursday-Sunday schedule that demands rotation.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\n“My plan for Josh Acheampong is very clear. I want him to stay with us. He’s absolutely part of our project,” said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca of the 19-year-old defender, who can play right-back, left-back and centre-back.",
      "A permanent transfer is off the table, but surely Chelsea would be open to loaning Acheampong to another Premier League club to pick up some vital experience before selling him next summer for £25million.",
      "Crystal Palace have reportedly enquired, which could see Acheampong follow in the footsteps of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Conor Gallagher by spending time at Selhurst Park on loan from the Blues.",
      "",
      "Tom Watson (Brighton)\nThere’s more chance of Watson going to the Championship than another Premier League club, unless he returns to Sunderland for the season.",
      "The 19-year-old scored the goal that got the Black Cats promoted, netting in injury time in the Championship play-off final against Sheffield United. His only post-season minutes came in that Wembley showpiece — and he made them count.",
      "",
      "Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)\nWe were reluctant to include players who’ve already spent time on loan in their short careers, but Kroupi is more a new signing than a returning loanee. Signed from Lorient in January, the teenage striker stayed where he was for the remainder of the campaign and helped the club win Ligue 2.",
      "The 19-year-old scored 22 goals in 30 appearances last season to help Lorient win promotion, after scoring five in just over 1,000 minutes in the top flight in 2023/24.",
      "He’s one for the future, and Bournemouth know it, having spent around £10m to sign him in the winter transfer window.",

      "Manchester United are really paying for previous mistakes which has left them unable to copper up for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Send your views on this and all subjects to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Man Utd paying for years of incompetence\nThe chickens are really coming home to roost this summer at United. The problems are too well known and widespread to warrant another yet another email about them but this summer’s transfer struggles are hopefully the natural end point of all of the nonsense of the previous 12 years.",
      "Firstly, United have no cash. Despite a relatively healthy PSR headroom for last FY (which must be healthier now we haven’t bought Mbeumo as expected), by all accounts United are running out of actual money to spend and need to sell to buy. This is a result of what now must be considered generational incompetence in the transfer market and a willingness to hand out extreme wages to players of a questionable age or suitability for Our League.",
      "The result of all this is that we can’t simply go around slapping £5M (add extra 0s where appropriate *cough* Anthony *cough*) extra on the table for any player we are interested in. We also can’t afford to take on big, big wages even where a transfer makes good sense for all involved (Osimhen).",
      "Basically haggling every deal within an inch of its life is the reality for United now. There is clearly frustration that United haven’t agreed or walked away from the Mbeumo deal but it seems to me he’s one of two players the club identified and went for early and were working on a deal that we can afford. There’s no way we’ve been speaking to Brentford for a month and we don’t know what the cost is. No, I think we’ve got our backs to the wall and we’re counting the pennies.",
      "I wonder also if this is holding up sales as well. Sell Garnacho for instance and there’s suddenly not quite as much need to be tight on Mbeumo. Brentford will know that and, to quote Van Der Sar, will challenge us to go as high as we can. That’s the right time to walk away.",
      "And on the subject of sales, that’s a massive clusterf**k. Naive from Amorim and the club to think they could publicly exile these players and expect that teams would still be lining up to sign them. The scarcity of cash and Ratcliffe’s wish to monetise everything at the club should mean that these players are treated like assets.",
      "If you want to get rid then fine but lower the price and move on. If you want to maximise your profit, make them look better than you have. Obviously none of the players have really done themselves any good in a United shirt and their loan spells have been a mixed bag. At the moment, everyone knows they’re overpaid and United are desperate to get rid. Not great conditions for a quick sale.",
      "But of course all these issues stem from past mistakes at the club: the distribution of excessive wages after short term performance (Rashford), terrible planning/negotiating (Anthony) and poor man-management (Sancho – all of them?). As with everything United, it’s systemic.",
      "We’re not going to see a United in the transfer market buying predatorily or selling efficiently until we fix the performance of the squad which we can’t do quickly until we’re better in the market. So it’s going to painful for some time.",
      "Be prepared this summer for no striker, centre mid or goalkeeper. This is just the reality for United now. I can live with it if in five years things have very much improved.",

Ridiculous.",
      "I’ve seen it insinuated so many times lately. I’m not saying they wont be challenging again – I’m sure they will be up there – but every year every team starts afresh. The league starts on zero points. Being 2nd the previous year doesn’t give you some sort of points advantage going into next season.",
      "Arsenal have not won the title the last few years simply because other teams were better than them and they were never as good as they and many others portrayed them to be. Liverpool won it last year because they were the best team from the kick off. And there is nothing to suggest they wont be the best team again next season. But they like everyone else are starting afresh (though obviously for tragic reasons theirs will be a strange and unusual campaign to start with).",

      "Man Utd are also working hard to try and get a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line but the Red Devils are yet to agree a fee with Brentford for the Cameroon international.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Tuesday 1 July 2025 11:40, UK",
      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
