      "Ruben Amorim has identified where Manchester United let the game slip against Bournemouth following an end-to-end 4-4 draw in the Premier League. United led three times at Old Trafford but ended the match with just a point after the Cherries hit back time and again.",
      "Amad Diallo put United ahead with a close-range header before Antoine Semenyo found the bottom corner to equalise for the away side. United went into the half-time break 2-1 up thanks to Casemiro's back-post header from a corner.",
      "But Bournemouth roared back through Evanilson's precise finish and Marcus Tavernier's blasted free-kick to lead 3-2. Bruno Fernandes curled a free-kick of his own into the top corner before Matheus Cunha kept his cool to finish a simple chance and make it 4-3 in the 79th minute.",
      "However, United's leaky defence was evident once more when Junior Kroupi beat Senne Lammens five minutes later. Lammens had to be alert late on to keep out David Brooks' effort as it finished all square.",
      "United were much the better side early on and, on reflection, Amorim believes that is when they should've made their dominance count to kill the game.",
      "\"It's really disappointing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We are really disappointed. Crazy game. It might look like we lost the two points in the second half, but I think we lost them in the first half.",
      "\"We dominated and created so many chances. We had to go to half-time with a different result. In the end we deserved more. It was a fun game for everyone at home.",
      "\"People especially at Old Trafford want to win but they want to be inspired to see a team play good football. We did that well in certain moments. It was a good performance but we need to be more clinical because created so many chances.",
      "\"Lammens did really well. There were opportunities for both sides. We created more. We need to find ways of closing the games because this happened many times. That's part of the process. We try to do things the best we can but in some moments it's not enough.\"",
      "\"The result should be completely different. And then again, six minutes of the second half, similar to Nottingham [Forest], we lost the concentration, and they score two goals. But we managed to get back to the game, we scored two goals again, and then we have to finish the game. Just a throw-in in our possession, we have to close and think about not to go again, to stay calm and close the game.",
      "\"I saw the effort of the players, I saw the effort of the defence, and at the end of the game, you make 4-3, I had the feeling that we would continue to push and score another one. We tried but in the end it was a draw.",
      "\"A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work [on]. We are not winning games sometimes in the details. It's not because it's a back four, back three, back five.",
      "\"It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game and we need to be clinical. Again, today against a very good team, we created many chances to win the game, and we should have won the three points.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's woes continued on Monday night as wasteful Manchester United allowed Bournemouth to claim a point at Old Trafford. United had 25 shots to their opponents' 14 and led three times but the game ended in a 4-4 draw after Eli Junior Kroupi's late equaliser.",
      "Next up for the Red Devils is a trip to Aston Villa, and Amorim already knew he would be without three players due to the Africa Cup of Nations. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both played against Bournemouth, though Noussair Mazraoui didn't, and all three will be away with their national sides.",
      "Not only that, but Casemiro will be unavailable on Sunday. The Brazilian will serve a suspension for an accumulation of yellow cards, having picked up a booking for a foul on Marcus Tavernier.",
      "To make matters worse, the card was for bringing Tavernier down as he threatened to run through on goal, only for the midfielder to score from the resulting free-kick anyway. It's Casemiro's second ban of the campaign, with the first arriving when he was sent off against Chelsea.",
      "That Tavernier goal was enough to leave United 3-2 down at Old Trafford early in the second half. Amad and Casemiro himself both scored for the hosts, only for Antoine Semenyo and Evanilson to equalise before Tavernier's free-kick.",
      "Bruno Fernandes managed to equalise for United with a free-kick in the 77th minute, before Matheus Cunha put United ahead a few minutes later. It wasn't enough, though, with Kroupi making it 4-4 and both sides having chances for a fifth.",
      "Casemiro's yellow card his seventh in the league this season but his fifth individual caution not including the two yellows he received in the win over Chelsea in September. The former Real Madrid man will now serve a one-match ban, which means he will be absent for the away game at Villa Park this weekend.",
      "United will be without the services their AFCON trio, though the extent of their absences will depend on how far their national sides progress in the competition. In addition to this. Mazraoui's Morocco are the hosts, while Amad's Cote d'Ivoire are reigning champions and go up against Mbeumo's Cameroon in the group stages.",
      "Amorim was unable to select Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt for the Bournemouth match due to injury, though Benjamin Sesko was involved after a recent injury absence of his own. Lisandro Martinez was also involved as he continued his comeback after missing several months of action.",

      "Gary Neville has revealed why the \"right decision\" was made not to have Antoine Semenyo sent off during Manchester United's dramatic draw with Bournemouth. United hosted the Cherries at Old Trafford in the Premier League as they sought to maintain their winning streak, but were forced to settle for a point in a hugely entertaining 4-4 draw.",
      "The Red Devils opened the scoring against the visitors through Amad Diallo's close-range header in the opening period, before Semenyo levelled matters for Bournemouth. Shortly after the Ghana international found the net for the Cherries, an incident involving Semenyo sparked discussion over a potential red card.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Semenyo contested an aerial duel, resulting in the Bournemouth forward hitting the deck. Semenyo then confronted Dalot and seemed to make contact with the United full-back's neck area using his hand, prompting referee Simon Hooper to step in and calm the situation.",
      "\"I can see why Semenyo's snapped. Dalot bumped him while he's in the air - it's a bit naughty.",
      "\"He's [Semenyo] gone for his [Dalot] neck but he just pulled back. Two yellow cards [one for each player] is the right decision.\"",
      "United managed to regain the lead in extra time, courtesy of a Casemiro header from a corner kick, before Evanlison levelled the score for Bournemouth early in the second half and Marcus Tavernier put the visitors ahead with a free-kick. Bruno Fernandes then equalised for United with a free-kick off his own midway through the second half, with Matheus Cunha putting the home side in front a couple of minutes later as the drama continued at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim told BBC Sport at full-time: \"It's really disappointing. We are really disappointed. Crazy game. It might look like we lost the two points in the second half but I think we lost them in the first half.",

      "When Matheus Cunha restored his team’s lead deep into an exhilarating contest, Ruben Amorim was the calmest man inside a volcanic Old Trafford.",
      "In fact, for a moment, he looked a little lost in thought. Perhaps he knew what was coming. Perhaps he knew his team is one that can always find new ways of NOT winning football matches.",
      "On that score, they duly obliged and Amorim will be under renewed pressure after allowing Junior Kroupi to earn Bouremouth a point. In fact, Amorim had late Senne Lammens saves to thank for avoiding what would have been a humiliating loss.",
      "This really was a hammer blow for United because with their reduced schedule and reasonable squad depth, this is a side that can have no excuses for not operating at full pelt in each and every Premier League fixture.",
      "Coupled with the dip in the competition’s overall standard, that is why a top-four finishing position is there for the taking. Anything less should be unacceptable.",
      "The intensity, muscularity and urgency shown in the first half of this contest should be standard for the rest of the season. Amorim also has resources to deal with the absence of Bryan Mbeumo and Diallo when the pair - along with Noussair Mazraoui - are on Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "Not that United will not miss their contributions. Diallo nodded in from inches after a Diogo Dalot cross had caused confusion and that was his simplest piece of work.",
      "Aside from that, his quick-footed trickery was always a threat to a Bournemouth side that looked a little surprised at United’s pacy directness.",
      "The home team had sent in a dozen efforts on goal before the away team had one. Mind you, Marcus Tavernier really should have buried his header rather than send it straight at Lammens. And one of the fundamental problems with this United team is its tendency to concede plenty of decent chances.",
      "Indeed, after Antoine Semenyo had expertly drilled in an equaliser, Andoni Iraola’s side could easily have gone ahead but, instead, some poor goalkeeping from Djordje Petrovic allowed Casemiro to restore United’s lead with a regulation header.",
      "But that penchant for affording the opposition opportunities was soon back in evidence, a clever but simple pass from Tavernier setting up a smart finish from Evanilson within a minute of the second half starting.",
      "The inconsistency of this United side - and we are talking inconsistency within a single game - really is startling. As vibrant as they had been for the early stages of the first half, they were insipid for the early stages of the second half.",
      "After a sloppy pass from Bruno Fernandes, Tavernier ran half the length of the field before being found by Casemiro. And an elaborate defensive wall set-up fell apart when Tavernier took the free-kick and, suddenly, what had shaped up to be United’s best performance of the season saw them in arrears before the hour mark.",
      "This, though, was a Bournemouth side who had taken just one point from their last five games. And their nervousness surfaced to allow United back into the lead. First, Bruno Fernandes curled in a beautiful free-kick and then Matheus Cunha gleefully tucked in United’s fourth.",
      "But this really is a United team that finds fresh ways of not getting over the line and Kroupi duly slid home the final equaliser of a remarkable night.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Manchester United to sign Antoine Semenyo after he scored in Bournemouth's 4-4 draw at Old Trafford. Semenyo scored the first of the Cherries' goals on an unforgettable Monday night to continue his impressive campaign.",
      "The Bournemouth forward made the most of a mistake by Luke Shaw to race through and find the bottom corner via the inside of the post in the 40th minute. His goal made it 1-1 after United had dominated the opening stages of the match.",
      "Semenyo now has seven goals in the Premier League this season and has attracted a lot of transfer attention ahead of the January window opening in the New Year. Clubs including Liverpool and Manchester City are aware that the Ghana international has a release clause for £65million in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "But former United defender Ferdinand wants Semenyo to end up at Old Trafford, instead of Anfield or the Etihad Stadium and made his feelings clear on social media.",
      "United tweeted: \"Goal. Antoine Semenyo levels for the visitors.\" Ferdinand replied: \"Don’t let him leave after the game,\" along with a crying laughing emoji.",
      "That was just one of his many observations while watching the mad-cap match from home. He was delighted with the first half, that saw United go into the break 2-1 up following goals from Amad Diallo and Casemiro.",
      "He wrote: \"Best 45 minutes under [Ruben] Amorim at Old Trafford… tempo, passing thru the lines, chances created. [Ayden] Heaven + [Lenny] Yoro looking assured. Lapse in focus for the goal, but reacted well!\"",
      "Ferdinand is likely to be disappointed on Semenyo, given United shelled out over £200m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the summer transfer window. But Ghana head coach Otto Addo is sure that Semenyo will make the step up from Bournemouth soon.",
      "“He has done very well at Bournemouth, but with all the respect for Bournemouth and what they’re doing, surely it is natural for him to take the next step,\" he told The Athletic.",
      "“Whether it's in the winter or summer, it is a difference question but it won’t make a difference for us. I’m looking forward to him showing more of what he can to the world.”",

      "One of the matches of the Premier League season saw both Bournemouth and Manchester United in touching distance of victory. In the end, though, both had to settle for a point after a Monday night classic.",
      "Ruben Amorim's hosts dominated en route to a 2-1 half-time lead before proving their own worst enemies as Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier struck in quick succession before drama struck in the final 15 minutes. Goals in double-quick time from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha put the hosts back in front, only for Eli Junior Kroupi to level from the bench.",
      "United dominated early on but only had one goal to show for it as they entered the closing stages of the first half, and were punished as Antoine Semenyo cancelled out Amad's opener. The hosts were back in front at the break, though, with Casemiro on target deep into stoppage time when visiting keeper Djordje Petrovic was too weak to keep out the Brazilian's header.",
      "Moments after the restart, though, it was all square again as Evanilson escaped a sleeping United defence before rolling home. and it was 3-2 to the visitors shortly after as Tavernier put away a free-kick after being felled by United scorer Casemiro.",
      "United rung the changes, with the returning Benjamin Sesko among those thrown on by Ruben Amorim, and were ultimately rewarded. Seconds after Fernandes' free-kick equaliser, Cunha collected a weak Adrien Truffert clearance and slammed the ball home, but Bournemouth weren't done and substitute Kroupi kept a cool head to give Senne Lammens no chance with barely six minutes to go.",
      "United threatened inside 90 seconds with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo leading a rapid attack, only for Bournemouth to get bodies in the way of Bruno Fernandes' eventual shot. Mason Mount was the next to go close, with his driven effort beaten away by Petrovic.",
      "They didn't have to wait that much longer. When the opener arrived, it came after the two wing-backs combined, with Petrovic only able to touch Diogo Dalot's teasing cross into the path of a grateful Amad who couldn't miss.",
      "Bournemouth offered little going forward in the opening half hour and Andoni Iraola may well have felt Marcus Tavernier's header straight at Senne Lammens was a chance they couldn't afford to miss. At the other end, a flying volley from Mbeumo might have lifted the roof off Old Trafford had it crept a little lower.",
      "United had a remarkable 17 shots in the first half, but it was only in the final knockings that they ensured they went in ahead at the break. Casemiro got the goal, but he could easily have scored earlier.",
      "The midfielder has only scored more than four league goals in two of his seasons as a pro, dating back to 2010. This was his fourth in 15 appearances this term.",
      "His joy didn't last long, though, with a yellow card early in the second half ensuring he'll miss the weekend meeting with Aston Villa through suspension. It's his second ban of the campaign, with the other coming after a red card against Chelsea, and Kobbie Mainoo was given half an hour in his place on Monday - perhaps with one eye on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the match, Ruben Amorim indicated he might switch from his trusted back three to a back four. His selection left either as an option, with questions over whether Diogo Dalot would operate as a wing-back or a full-back, and things appeared fluid to begin with.",
      "There were moments when United appeared to revert to a four, with one of the nominal wing-backs dropping deep as the other advanced. However, a full departure from the Amorim system this was not.",
      "Frustratingly for United, it was a night to forget for the entire back-line. That includes the often reliable goalkeeper Senne Lammens, who arguably could have done a lot better with Tavernier's effort.",
      "Amad was at the centre of so much of United's good work in the first half, but Amorim will now be without the Ivorian for as long as the Africa Cup of Nations holders remain in the tournament. And that's a problem, because few can replicate his role in the team.",
      "The former Atalanta man probably won't score an easier goal than the one he put away early on, while a mazy run shortly after the half-hour mark caused real problems. It may be that United experiment with different ways of attacking during his absence rather than trying to put square pegs in round holes.",
      "Not only that, but Bryan Mbeumo will be absent as well. Noussair Mazraoui was already unavailable, with the Moroccan robbing United of cover across the back-line while on duty with the AFCON hosts.",
      "On Sunday, there was plenty of chatter about Erling Haaland taking advantage for Manchester City after barely getting a sniff of goal early on. The next day, Antoine Semenyo showed two can play at that game.",
      "The Ghanaian needed barely a sniff to level things up in the first half after Luke Shaw was caught in possession. It was moments like this which will leave Bournemouth delighted Ghana failed to qualify for AFCON this time around.",
      "Whether they keep hold of Semenyo throughout January is another matter, with a number of the league's big hitters involved. And throughout this season we've seen why.",
      "In 17 matches this season, Manchester United have kept just one clean sheet. That came against Sunderland, more than two months ago.",
      "Their defending against Bournemouth suggested they may have to wait a while for their next one as well. United had more of the shots but still provided far too many opportunities to the visitors.",
      "They might want to cling onto the memory of shutting out upcoming opponents Villa when the sides met on the final day of last season. At this rate, though, it would take a miracle for Villa to draw another blank.",

      "Harry Amass had the perfect response to Ruben Amorim’s criticism of Manchester United’s academy graduates, but wasn’t brave enough to leave his post up. Amorim has turned heads in the build-up to United’s game against Bournemouth on Monday night by slamming the level of the club’s young players.",
      "Amass, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi are the only three United academy graduates to have made their first-team debuts for the club since Amorim arrived over a year ago. That is a departure from the club’s proud history of bringing through homegrown youngsters, but Amorim had a stern response while speaking about Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer.",
      "\"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here,\" he said. “He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "“It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!”",
      "His comments didn’t go down well with United supporters and they appear to have riled Amass too. The 18-year-old left-back is currently on loan with Sheffield Wednesday, where he has been performing well, despite the club’s difficulties, with points deductions for financial struggles leaving them rock bottom of the Championship on -9.",
      "Amass has been one of the shining lights during a tough spell in the club’s history and reacted to Amorim’s comments by posting a photo of himself holding Wednesday’s player of the month award for November on his Instagram story. Perhaps sensing a backlash from his employer, he later deleted the post.",
      "The young defender has only made seven appearances for the United first team, having been handed his debut in March. He was loaned out to gain more experience, with Amorim able to call upon Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot at left wingback.",
      "He has made 15 appearances for Wednesday so far, contributing one goal and one assist. Amorim may not have been impressed, but Owls boss Henrik Pedersen is delighted with his player.",
      "“I think he has had a fantastic development,” Pedersen said of Amass recently. “A bit like Charlie [McNeill], a big talent, but what is big talent? With young players, we know they can do something, and then they are a little bit sometimes good, sometimes not good. Sometimes there’s a big difference in the level of the performance.",
      "“I think Harry started the season very well, then he had a little bit where he went down. Not down, but where it was more unstable. But then in the last five, six games he has been very strong.",
      "“He does a great job, and he does a great job together with his teammates because, again, nobody can do something alone – and it is the same for Harry. But Harry has played a fantastic season. I’m sure that we will do everything to keep him, and I’m also sure that for Harry and for United it’s a good match right now.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly set their sights on Bournemouth's Tyler Adams ahead of the January transfer window. The United States midfielder is valued at £40million with the Reds Devils having a chance to take a close look at him when they dace the Cherries on Monday night.",
      "United have been linked with a host of Premier League midfielders since the summer window - as they aim to bolster a perceived weak area in their squad. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba have been frequently mentioned, but their hefty price tags could prove to be a hurdle.",
      "As such, Adams might be a more feasible target for the club ahead of the January transfer window. According to The Daily Mail, the 26-year-old has 'cropped up in conversations' regarding United's potential midfield acquisitions in January or next summer.",
      "Adams has previously expressed his fondness for playing at the Theatre of Dreams, hinting that he would be open to a move. He said: \"It's just a special occasion.",
      "\"This is what you grow up watching, whether you're a [United] fan or not. A fan of Manchester United walking into Old Trafford will change your perspective on everything.",
      "\"I played against Manchester United at Old Trafford during COVID with RB Leipzig. That was the first time I walked into Old Trafford and I was like, my dream is really to play in the Premier League because this is what it's about right here.",
      "\"Now, being able to go back and play there multiple times and have good results, especially makes it a little bit better. So yeah, I always get excited to play against United.\"",
      "Adams' potential arrival at the Reds could, in turn, see academy product Kobbie Mainoo edged towards the exit door. The 20-year-old has found opportunities limited under Amorim, and is yet to make a single Premier League start this season.",
      "The Portuguese has encouraged Mainoo to approach him directly, though, if he's considering a January departure. \"The team comes first and if Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk with me about that. I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.",
      "\"The frustration doesn't help anybody. But, again, the focus is on this game - and we will see if that happens.",
      "\"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players but about that subject, no. I didn't speak with him.\"",

      "For the second consecutive Monday, Manchester United will close out the latest Premier League gameweek, this time welcoming Bournemouth to Old Trafford. Last Monday, the Red Devils cruised past bottom-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Bournemouth’s struggles continued with a goalless draw against Chelsea.",
      "When Jean-Ricner Bellegarde equalized for winless Wolves at Molineux, United fans may have feared another disappointing result against a side threatening to become one of the league’s worst ever. However, Bruno Fernandes led by example, inspiring United to a commanding 4-1 victory. The Portuguese star found the net twice, assisted Mason Mount, and Bryan Mbeumo also got on the scoresheet in what could be his final club appearance of 2025.",
      "Having lost just one of their last nine matches and picking up seven points from their last three games, United’s faith in manager Ruben Amorim appears to be paying off. The former Sporting Lisbon boss has guided his team into the Premier League’s top six. Over their last nine fixtures, United have collected 18 points—more than they managed in their previous 17 matches—though consistency at Old Trafford remains elusive. After a run of four straight home wins from late August to late October, United have now gone two home games without a victory and have conceded in 14 of their 15 league games this season.",
      "Bournemouth, meanwhile, matched United’s clean sheet tally for the season with their draw against Chelsea in gameweek 15—a result that, while respectable against the Club World Cup holders, did little to end their winless streak. Since defeating Nottingham Forest 2-0 at the end of October, the Cherries have failed to win any of their last six top-flight matches, earning just two points from a possible 18. This poor run has seen them slip into the bottom half of the table, largely due to a decline in attacking output. On Monday, Bournemouth risk failing to score in three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since the 2022-23 season.",
      "Once a nightmare for opposition defences, the highly sought-after Antoine Semenyo has now gone seven league games without a goal or assist, perhaps distracted by ongoing transfer speculation. His dip in form has coincided with Bournemouth’s slide down the standings. Nevertheless, the Cherries have remarkably beaten United 3-0 at Old Trafford in each of the last two Premier League seasons, contributing to a four-match unbeaten streak against the Red Devils in the competition.",
      "This match clashes with the mandatory release date for the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) but Amad Diallo (Ivory Coast), Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon), and Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco) have not yet been ruled out of Monday’s match. The same is true for Benjamin Sesko, who is recovering from a recent bout of food poisoning after a knee injury, but Matthijs de Ligt (back) and Harry Maguire (hamstring) remain unavailable for Manchester United.",
      "Nineteen-year-old Ayden Heaven made his second consecutive Premier League start in De Ligt’s absence against Wolves, and the former Arsenal youth player has likely done enough to keep his place on Monday, provided Lisandro Martinez is still not fit to start.",
      "On the Bournemouth side, manager Andoni Iraola was forced to substitute Marcos Senesi in the 62nd minute of last weekend’s draw with Chelsea, but he is optimistic that the Argentine was only suffering from cramp and should be available for Monday’s game. Senesi’s presence will be particularly important, as fellow defender Veljko Milosavljevic is sidelined for two to three months with a knee ligament injury, joining Ryan Christie (knee) and Ben-Gannon Doak (hamstring) on the injury list.",
      "Lewis Cook will serve the final match of his three-game suspension on Monday night, but Tyler Adams is available again after serving a one-match ban for yellow card accumulation and is expected to return to the midfield.",

      "In that game - like the previous 56 under Amorim - United lined up in his preferred formation, 3-4-2-1. Former players, fans and pundits alike have spent months urging the Portuguese to be less fixated on that shape and move to a four-man defence, one more traditional in the English game.",
      "The formation, however, that worked a treat during his time at Sporting Lisbon and Braga beforehand. But during a team meeting before the victory over Wolves, Amorim effectively told his players that 'a change is coming'.",
      "For the past week, a significant amount of time in training was dedicated to playing in a 4-3-3 formation, sources revealed to the Athletic. Such a change would make Bournemouth's visit to Old Trafford a key point in Amorim's reign.",
      "Monday's fixture also represents the first time that United could be without three starters who are due to play for their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations. Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco), Amad (Ivory Coast) and Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon) have all received call-ups, but it's unknown how many - if any - of the trio will be involved due to the tournament which begins later this week.",
      "Mazraoui, Amad and Mbeumo have made up the entirety of United's right-hand side in recent games, giving Amorim a headache for when they're absent. Also, in his Friday pre-match press conference, the Red Devils boss hinted that the out-of-favour Kobbie Mainoo could be given more game time by playing with three central midfielders instead of two.",
      "\"The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing,\" Amorim explained. \"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot.\"",
      "The 40-year-old was then asked how Benjamin Sesko's impending return from injury would impact his decisions, having used Matheus Cunha as a striker last time out. \"I think it's not just Ben but everyone,\" Amorim replied.",
      "\"We need to adapt a little bit the way we are going to play the games, and that is a good opportunity to do that because we cannot think that we are going to play the same way without Amad, Bryan and Nous (Mazraoui), but especially Amad and Bryan because of the characteristics. That is really hard to get.",
      "\"They have more or less the same characteristics, the both of them, and we are losing them for a few games. But it's a good opportunity for us to try to play in a different way.\"",

      "Manchester United fans have been left stunned after Ruben Amorim took a swipe at the club's famous academy. United manager Amorim has been criticised for not involving enough homegrown players during his troubled 13-month reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Only three youngsters - Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi - have debuted under the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, who flooded his team with academy products at his former club. Amorim, though, has suggested that two of those three alongside Toby Collyer - who made his debut under Erik ten Hag - were promoted to the first-team too early.",
      "Obi featured in the senior squad last season but has mainly trained United's under-21s this term while Harry Amass has been a regular since joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan. Collyer, meanwhile, is back at United recovering from an injury after making four appearances on loan at West Bromwich Albion.",
      "While discussing the future of Kobbie Mainoo, United's star academy graduate of the past few seasons, Amorim began criticising the club's youth system. \"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here,\" the Red Devils boss began.",
      "\"He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Amorim was likely referencing Wednesday's troubles as opposed to Amass' own performances. The Championship club want to extend the left-back's loan until the end of the season.",
      "United fans reacted with fury, with one posting on X: \"What is Amorim trying to achieve with those quotes about Mainoo and the academy? Honestly just self sabotage at this point.\" Another said: \"Slagging off our academy players to defend his stubbornness is a new low for Amorim.\"",
      "A third followed up by writing: \"Ruben Amorim throwing the academy players under the bus, knowing full well the fundamentals of the club's history is built on the academy surely has to be the final straw for (Jason) Wilcox and INEOS. He's not the right man for the job and we must act before we lose more youth talents.\"",
      "United supporters also fear that the club's remarkable record of featuring a homegrown player in every matchday squad for the last 88 years (more than 4,300 games) will come to an end under Amorim due to his lack of trust. In November, midfielder Jack Fletcher was called up for the Red Devils' trip to Tottenham, ensuring that the record stayed intact.",
      "\"There is something special in our club which has to be bullet proof. The way we behave, the way we feel [about] the club. We are not going to stop with academy players. It doesn't matter about the result.",
      "\"We will continue with these small details which are the foundations of our club. We have that record, we won't break that record. And Jack is ready to help us. We will show that our academy is our future. The players in our academy must be ready to help us.\"",

French media coverage was dominated by Greenwood's match-winning heroics, though goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli also earned his share of the acclaim.",
      "Le Figaro branded Greenwood \"indispensable\" after his late dramatics, a familiar theme following his double against Union Saint-Gilloise that secured a 3-2 Champions League victory last week. The paper's glowing assessment read: \"Lively at times, then quiet, the English striker once again produced a moment of brilliance to rescue his team.\"",
      "Rulli and Nayef Aguerd delivered their own crucial interventions in the dying moments to maintain the shutout. Once more, Foot Mercato reserved its highest praise for Greenwood following his magical intervention.",
      "A section from the match report read: \"Under pressure for much of the match, Marseille secured this hard-fought win and can thank Rulli and Greenwood for this laborious victory.\"",
      "Le Phoceen heaped even greater plaudits on the former England international. Greenwood earned a match rating of 8.5 out of 10, matching Rulli as the top-rated performer at the Velodrome.",
      "\"Another commanding performance from Greenwood, who played with the impression that he could decide the fate of a play at will,\" it said. \"His first half was bursting with activity: he dropped deep, accelerated 20 metres, broke lines, and forced Monaco to defend deep.",
      "\"Even when the team was under pressure, he continued to create danger with his dribbling and changes of pace. And then there was that clinical goal: control, a quick finish, top corner, no question about it.\"",
      "Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi, who recently tipped Greenwood as a potential Ballon d'Or contender, revealed post-match that he had nearly substituted the winger moments before his decisive strike. He emphasised the player's unpredictability, capable of changing the game's momentum in an instant.",
      "Le Meridional went even further with its praise, branding Greenwood \"unstoppable,\" particularly in that crucial moment. The victory ensured Marseille retained third spot in Ligue 1, made all the sweeter considering the decisive moment came against bitter rivals.",
      "\"Unstoppable, 1-0 to Marseille,\" read one extract. \"The goalscorer takes off his shirt in euphoria, receives a yellow card, but most importantly scores his 11th Ligue 1 goal of the season, cementing his status as the linchpin of Marseille's attack. His 32nd goal in 49 league matches.\"",

      "Manchester United could finally land one of Louis van Gaal's former targets with Sergio Ramos now a free agent. The Real Madrid legend signed for Mexican outfit Monterrey back in February after one season back at his beloved Sevilla.",
      "His Mexican adventure wrapped up after 10 months, with Ramos confirming his exit from the club earlier this month. With no indication he's ready to hang up his boots just yet, the 39-year-old hasn't yet revealed his next destination, though United are among several clubs reportedly keen.",
      "Spanish publication Cadena SER made the initial claim, though ESPN have subsequently suggested the Premier League giants aren't actively pursuing the centre-back. If Ramos were to make his maiden voyage to the Premier League, it would represent a decade-long pursuit finally coming to fruition.",
      "He featured prominently on Van Gaal's shopping list when the Dutchman took charge at Old Trafford in 2014. He had plans to partner Ramos alongside former Germany international Mats Hummels, who was shining in his first stint with Borussia Dortmund at the time.",
      "Discussing the players who got away during his United tenure, Van Gaal told FourFourTwo: \"I wanted [Robert] Lewandowski, but when this proved difficult I tried to get Gonzalo Higuain instead. Before I had arrived, I also spoke with the board about Neymar. If you are at United, you have to think big.",
      "\"He was also interesting for the club in terms of selling shirts, and I wanted to have quick wingers. For that reason, I also tried to get Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez. Thomas Muller was on my wish list, too, and in central midfield I wanted N'Golo Kante.",
      "\"I even tried to sign James Milner, who was already quite old but very multi-functional and possessed leadership skills. For the defence, I wanted Ramos and Mats Hummels, because ours wasn't the strongest in building from the back.",
      "\"Those were my top targets, but we couldn't get any of them. I don't know why, because as the manager I wasn't involved in any negotiations. After I left, players like Mahrez and Kante ended up at Manchester City and Chelsea, while United couldn't get them. I found that very odd.\"",
      "With the January transfer window approaching, Ruben Amorim may well be considering defensive reinforcements, particularly given the injury problems affecting Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt. The availability of the fit-again Lisandro Martinez also raises concerns as the Argentinian has managed just 61 Premier League outings since his 2022 arrival.",
      "Discussing potential squad additions, Amorim recently said: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen. But of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and in January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "FIFA has set a release date of Monday, December 15 (today), for all clubs to release players for the tournament, which starts in Morocco on Sunday. This, however, has created a predicament for United, as their match against the Cherries is scheduled just five days before the tournament begins.",

Elsewhere, defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out injured, while striker Benjamin Sesko remains a doubt due to food poisoning, despite having returned to first-team training after a knee injury.",
      "When quizzed about the availability of United's players on Friday, Amorim revealed that some decisions might be made at the last minute. He disclosed: \"Maguire is out, De Ligt is out. Ben [Sesko], we have to see.",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "\"We have two trainings still. The other two are out, Benjamin, we will assess.\"",
      "Amorim later elaborated on De Ligt's injury, which saw him miss the draw against West Ham and then the victory over Wolves on Monday night.",
      "\"I think he has something in his back, I don't know for sure,\" he continued. \"Sometimes you see it's not a big injury, because he finished the game quite well against Crystal Palace, but he has some pain.",
      "\"You sometimes think it will be solved during this week, but sometimes he feels a little bit of pain, and we have to be a little careful with that.\"",
      "Regarding those heading to AFCON, he added: \"I expect today [Friday] to have a decision or maybe tomorrow, but we are waiting until the last moment to have all the players available - to choose the best team to start the game.\"",

      "The final call-up was Amad, who has been included in the Ivory Coast squad for AFCON. As it stands, Amorim is unsure over whether any of the trio can play but their exits give him some selection headaches for the clash with Bournemouth.",
      "Starting in goal, the choice is obvious for Amorim, with summer signing Senne Lammens having now firmly locked down the number one shirt at Old Trafford. The defence in front of him could look slightly different, however.",
      "Both Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire missed training before the game as they contend with issues, while Mazraoui is potentially not available. That could see Luke Shaw retain his place, while Lisandro Martinez could be a potential option as he steps up his return.",

      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end. Kobbs is one more player that I understand all the interests. I understand how important it is. The hopes that you guys and English guys have. I also just want to win. If he's the right guy, I will put him in. No problem.\"",
      "The United manager was asked a total of seven questions about Mainoo during his press conference, most notably adding that he's willing to sit down and discuss a January exit.",
      "\"First of all, the team comes first. If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody. But again, the focus is on this game. We will see if that happens.\"",

      "Manchester United saw the chance to go fifth in the Premier League slip by once again as they shared eight goals with Bournemouth in a wild game at Old Trafford.",
      "United produced a better attacking performance and led at the break thanks to goals from Amad and Casemiro, with Antoine Semenyo's strike separating them.",
      "But they were woeful at the back. Semenyo's goal was a gift and Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier put the Cherries ahead. Two goals in three minutes from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha restored United's lead only for Junior Kroupi to snatch a point for the visitors.",
      "Here are your player ratings from Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One good first-half save, but flat-footed when beaten by Evanilson and should have saved Tavernier's free-kick. Good save late on. 5",
      "Leny Yoro: Not at the scene of the crime for some dire defensive mishaps but doesn't always spread calm amongst his teammates. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Slow to spot the danger and close down Semenyo for the first goal and then the wrong side of Evanilson for the second. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Bullied off the ball by Kluivert for the first goal when he really has to be stronger. Moved back to left-back in a back four midway through the second half. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Excellent cross for the first goal and started brightly. Moved from left-back to right-back midway through the second half. 6",
      "Casemiro: In the right place from a corner again, but Djordje Petrovic should have saved it. Not always convincing on the ball and a desperate tackle conceded a free-kick for the third goal. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Caught on the ball for a break that led to the free-kick for Bournemouth's third, but a magnificent free-kick got United level and managed an assist to boot. 7",
      "Amad: Made a mess of an early pass to Bryan Mbeumo but made up for it with his goal and some really incisive attacks. Hardly alone in struggling a bit more after the break. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Not at his best. Volleyed over a difficult chance and shot too close to Petrovic for another first-half opportunity. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Excellent in the first half when his passing and pressing really shone, and he was the heart of so much good, but in influence waned after the break. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: An exhibition of quality as a false nine in the first half. Two brilliant passes to free Amad and a lovely cross for Mbeumo. Deserved his goal. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Got half an hour and showed some quality in a chaotic game. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: One crunching tackle. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Did well for Cunha's goal. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: No time to make an impact. N/A",
      "Patrick Dorgu: No time to make an impact. N/A",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Fredricson, Malacia, Ugarte",

      "It has taken Ruben Amorim 13 months and 59 games as Manchester United head coach to bend to his principles and give in to pressure from pundits, supporters and even some players, but after a night of high drama and even higher stress, he might be reluctant to do so again.",
      "Amorim had hinted on Friday that the loss of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Africa Cup of Nations might force him into a tactical rethink, and this was the first sign of that plan. The one change from Wolves looked like-for-like, but when the game began, it was clear this was more back four than back three.",
      "There was plenty of versatility there. At times, it reverted to the familiar shape with Amad at wing-back, but more often than not he was further forward, with Leny Yoro at right-back and Diogo Dalot at left-back. Throughout the first half, it looked like Amorim had been missing a trick all along. By full-time, there were as many questions facing a back four as there were a back three.",
      "When will the real United under Amorim reveal themselves? They were electric in the opening exchanges in the first half and then out of battery at the start of the second. The contrast was baffling, as it was at both ends of the pitch. United were brilliant going forward but hopeless at the back and once again they saw the chance to go fifth get away from them.",
      "Bruno Fernandes couldn't hide his frustration at full-time. He was animated in arguing with Casemiro but looked to be venting his wider complaints at the Brazilian. He knows this chaos can't continue.",
      "It had looked like a different story on at least a couple of occasions. Three times United lead and after starting without intensity against Everton and West Ham, they tore into Bournemouth.",
      "Amad's goal in the 13th minute was United's eighth shot of the evening and the least they deserved for the enterprise they had shown in the opening exchanges. It was noticeable that Amorim's tactical shift was getting more players into the box. Bournemouth had been overworked in blocking shots from Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Amad, while Djordje Petrovic saved from Mason Mount.",
      "Petrovic could only stick an arm out when trying to smother Diogo Dalot's dangerous cross with Cunha lurking. The Brazilian didn't get a touch, but the ball bounced up for Amad to head into an empty net from a couple of yards out.",
      "The chances kept coming. Cunha stroked a shot just wide and Mbeumo forced Petrovic into another save. Cunha was pulling the strings as a false nine. Another excellent pass from his own half released Amad, whose shot was blocked by Adam Smith, and a perfect Cunha cross was met acrobatically by Mbeumo, but he could only volley over.",
      "United had racked up 12 shots to zero by the half hour but had a warning when Semme Lammens saved Marcus Tavernier's header from six yards, only they didn't heed it. Luke Shaw was bullied off the ball by Justin Kluivert and Ayden Heaven too slow to Antoine Semenyo, before his finish off the post.",
      "Casemiro restored the lead before half-time, with Petrovic making a mess of his header from Fernandes' corner, and it felt like that should have been that. But if United started the first half well, they were sleeping after the break.",
      "Within seconds of the restart, Tavernier's pass found Evanilson on the wrong side of Heaven, and he finished past a flat-footed Lammens. Soon after, Fernandes was caught on the ball in midfield and Casemiro forced into desperate action, conceding a free-kick 20 yards out. It proved pointless, Tavernier's low effort beating Lammens, who should have been protecting that side of the goal.",
      "United were beginning to look out of ideas as Amorim turned to Kobbie Mainoo to try and save his blushes. The roar that greeted Mainoo's emergence for Casemiro made it clear that Old Trafford regulars have no desire to see the academy graduate spend the second half of the season out on loan, but that noise was soon eclipsed.",
      "Fernandes made up for his mistake for Bournemouth's third by curling a magnificent free-kick into the top corner with 13 minutes to go, waving his arms to demand urgency on the pitch and in the stands. He got it immediately. Mbeumo forced his way through a tackle, Benjamin Sekso carried on the move and Cunha capitalised on a defensive error to fire in his second goal for the club.",
      "Fernandes made a beeline for the subs before running in front of the Stretford End to join his delirious teammates. Cunha kissed his shirt in front of the stand and Old Trafford came alive.",
      "But these supporters know by now never to take anything for granted. Junior Kroupi found space on the edge of the area and delivered a stunning finish and Bournemouth looked the more likely to win it. In eight added minutes, Lammens saved twice from David Brooks to ensure a disappointing night didn't become disastrous.",

      "Ruben Amorim won't turn to the transfer market to solve Manchester United's defensive woes despite admitting that his side \"lack quality\" defensively after their chaotic 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in the Premier League. United led three times at Old Trafford and produced a vibrant attacking display but they were undone defensively too often.",
      "Amad and Casemiro scored in the first half, but they fell 3-2 behind, when two goals in three minutes from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha looked to secure victory, only for Junior Kroupi to equalise.",
      "Only Manchester City have scored more goals in the Premier League than United's 30 this season, but they have shipped 26, a tally only exceeded by the bottom four and Bournemouth, and while Amorim is happy with some elements of United's defending, he is concerned at their efforts around their own penalty area.",
      "\"I think we are pressing better, we are controlling the game better, far from our goal, [but] we are lacking quality when we defend our goal. It's something that we need to address,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it's different when you suffer so many goals and the opponent doesn't have the same amount or not even near that we create to the opponent. It's really frustrating, but we need to work a lot in the way we defend the box.\"",
      "United spent £215million to improve their attack in the summer, focusing resources on signing attackers. The trio of Bryan Mbeumo, Cunha and Benjamin Sesko were all involved in the fourth goal and they have improved United's attacking output.",
      "The concerns now lie at the back but despite Amorim's issues with United's defending, he doesn't intend to resort to the chequebook to solve the issues.",
      "\"No, I think we have talent in the back, we have quality players in the back, we just need to be better as a team defending,\" he said.",
      "\"But that is a good point, that at least shows that we took care of the offence, we are improving, but I think it's not the same situation. We have the characteristics, we just need to work together and improve our players because they have the quality to defend better.\"",

It’s a great example of what Mount can do and he is setting a good example tonight. This is up there with the best 25 minutes so far of United’s season. The shots are raining in on Petrovic’s goal and a second before half-time feels like it’s on the cards at the moment.",

They could have had two or three already. They are getting plenty of players into the box and into good attacking positions. Credit to Dalot for an excellent ball in and Amad couldn’t miss. They should be looking to drive home this advantage now.",

There has been conflict between former club greats and the current crop of players, as well as recent managers, in the last few years over some heavy-handed criticism from the comfort of TV studios and podcast booths.",

      "FIFA has set a release date of Monday, December 15, for clubs to release players for the tournament, which kicks off in Morocco on Sunday. This, however, has created a predicament for United, as their match against the Cherries is scheduled just five days before the tournament kicks off.",
      "Club officials have been in discussions with the football federations of Cameroon, Morocco, and the Ivory Coast regarding all three players in an attempt to secure an extension. The extension would allow them to participate in the Bournemouth match before jetting off to the tournament.",

      "According to CaughtOffside, United chiefs are 'increasingly open' to selling club captain Bruno Fernandes in the near future.",
      "He may have the most combined goals and assists of any player at the club this season, however at 31 years of age a lucrative sale would allow for reinvestment in potential transfer targets such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The report suggests 'strong interest' will arrive from Saudi Arabia, in particular from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad.",
      "Ruben Amorim labelled Antoine Semenyo a \"special player\" ahead of Manchester United's Premier League fixture with Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night. United showed an interest in the forward during the summer before making moves for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to strengthen their attack.",
      "Semenyo remained with the Cherries and enjoyed another strong start to the season, although his form has wavered in the past few weeks. The 25-year-old hasn't scored or assisted in any of his last seven games, although a return of six goals and three assists in 14 Premier League games is still impressive.",
      "The Ghana international, who will remain available for Bournemouth for the next month after his country failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), will be a threat to United tonight. Amorim spoke highly of Bournemouth, Semenyo, and their head coach, Andoni Iroala, despite their failure to win any of their last six games.",

      "Amorim has settled on a midfield partnership of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes this season and has said Mainoo is competing with Fernandes for a starting role. His chances of playing as a No. 10 have receded with the summer additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United's dazzling attacking display against Bournemouth had inspired their fans after the two teams combined to deliver the game of the Premier League season at Old Trafford. United produced one of their best attacking performances under Amorim, with 25 shots and a string of stylish moves as Amorim tinkered with his system and saw more players getting into positions around the opposition penalty area.",
      "The vibrancy came with risks at the back, however, and after Bournemouth made it 4-4 with six minutes to go, they threatened to win the game three times in added time, with Senne Lammens rescuing United. It was a wild and chaotic game and ultimately one United should have won, although Amorim was keen to take the positives from a performance he felt was in keeping with the club's ethos.",
      "\"If you understand a little bit, if you follow the club like I follow Premier League for so long, you have not just the duty to try to win the games, but the way you try to win the games is so important for the fans,\" he said.",
      "\"They are desperate to win, but they are also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford. Today was inspiring, I think also because of Bournemouth, but in the end, that's the feeling of frustration not winning the game.\"",
      "Only Manchester City (38) have scored more than United's 30 Premier League goals this season and their attack has been transformed by a £215million summer spending spree on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim feels that has made his team more watchable but he knows they can't sacrifice defensive quality at the altar of scoring more goals.",
      "\"I think people enjoy more to see Manchester United this season, but we need to put both things together,\" he said. \"Sometimes closing the games is so important to give different issues to everything that we did really well. \"",
      "United have made a habit of throwing away leads recently and they led three times against the Cherries, but Amorim rejected the idea that it was a mentality issue affecting his team.",
      "\"It's understanding of the moments of the game, understanding that a lot of goals, it's after half-time, we need to start the second half in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"So it's everything together, it's not a mentality thing, it's the understanding of the game and how to play the game in different moments.\"",

Amorim has not started Mainoo in any of United’s 16 Premier League games so far this season, with the midfielder’s only start coming in the Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "Paul Scholes warned the England international recently that he is “being ruined” by his lack of chances under Amorim and suggested he needs to leave Old Trafford for the good of his career. The 20-year-old had the world at his feet after a stunning breakthrough campaign in 2023/24, which ended with him scoring the winner in the FA Cup final and breaking into the England team.",
      "A January departure from Old Trafford is already being talked about after Mainoo saw his request for a move away during the summer rejected. And now his brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, has taken to social media to post a picture of himself wearing a t-shirt saying “FREE KOBBIE MAINOO” at Old Trafford during United’s dramatic 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night.",
      "Amorim was asked in the buildup to Monday night's game if the 20-year-old had spoken to him regarding a temporary move, and he replied: “If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "“I’m not going to say what I’m going to say to Kobbie but I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals.",
      "“The frustration [of any player] doesn’t help anybody. But again, the focus is [Bournemouth] and we will see if that happens.",
      "“I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players but about that subject, no I didn’t speak with him. I am completely open [to talk].”",
      "Before the United boss added: “I know that for you guys there are some players that you believe in a lot and I believe a lot but sometimes I have to make choices.",
      "“We play with two midfielders. We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it’s really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.”",
      "Mainoo replaced Casemiro just after the hour mark during United’s 4-4 draw with Andoni Iraola's side. The Reds took the lead through Amad before Antoine Semenyo restored parity for his side.",
      "But United headed into the break ahead thanks to Casemiro, but two quick goals from Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier at the start of the second-half turned the game on its head. But Bruno Fernandes' free-kick and Matheus Cunha's effort within two minutes of each other swung the game back in United’s favour before Eli Junior Kroupi rescued the visitors a point.",

      "Ruben Amorim did not confirm whether Manchester United will play against Bournemouth with a different formation. Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-3 formation since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon, but there has been a suggestion that he could tinker with his approach to face Bournemouth.",
      "United returned to winning ways in the Premier League with a victory against Wolves last time out, with Bruno Fernandes scoring a brace and Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount scoring a goal each.",
      "The Reds have the opportunity to win back-to-back league matches against Bournemouth. United will move to fifth in the table if they beat the Cherries at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim has made one change from last week's win. Noussair Mazraoui has dropped out of the squad to report to the Africa Cup of Nations, which has opened the door for Leny Yoro to be recalled.",
      "\"Of course, we need to think about the future, we need to have more variety in our game, we are going to lose two wingers [to AFCON] so we need to adapt to the players we have and learn from some mistakes in the past.”",
      "Amorim was asked whether it would be three at the back against Bournemouth and responded: “You can find out. And you can see the line-up is the same, so you tell me.”",
      "Asked about United's form, Amorim said: “Inconsistencies. We are winning more games, we are not losing so many but that is not enough.",
      "\"We had some moments that could have been crucial for more points this season and we need to acknowledge that. We are improving in certain areas, we are having more shots and scoring more goals.",
      "\"We need to be careful with the other side of the game, we are suffering too many goals and that could be a problem in the future.”",
      "The United boss discussed Matheus Cunha's form, adding: “You have to see that Cunha had an injury, Bryan [Mbeumo] is the type of player who can give us more pace, more threat when he makes the runs, Cunha is completely the opposite and sometimes one is finishing more plays than the other, sometimes it is a matter of luck.",
      "\"Cunha did a really good job that last game, he had some chances, he needs to score more goals but he is creating overloads in certain areas and Bryan is being the threat that we knew from Brentford.”",

      "Manchester United will arrive at Old Trafford tonight with all eyes on the team bus to see if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo get off it. On Friday, Ruben Amorim suggested he was still in the dark as to whether the trio would be involved or not against Bournemouth.",
      "Negotiations with the stars' respective national teams have been ongoing for weeks but the outcome up to now has been unknown. Amorim attempted to twist this into a positive by suggesting it will also keep Andoni Iraola guessing but undoubtedly it will be frustrating for United to be in the dark.",
      "So with little known as to the availability of the trio, our best guess is that the three men remain with United for this game before jetting off for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). If this is the case, Mazraoui is likely to keep his place on the left side of the back three to allow Leny Yoro a further rest from the start.",
      "Ayden Heaven has been trusted to start the last two games and there is no evidence to suggest Amorim will change his mind on that approach tonight. Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire's absences will be felt hard",
      "As the club's best wing-back, Amad will keep his place in the starting XI with Diogo Dalot likely to keep the left wing-back role after scoring against West Ham and being unlucky not to add to his tally vs Bournemouth. Patrick Dorgu's chance should come once Amad leaves for AFCON and Dalot is moved to right wing-back.",
      "Having Mbeumo available would be ideal for United and including him in the starting line-up takes some pressure off the stretched attack. Benjamin Sesko is back to full fitness but a bout of food poisoning has put his place in the team in doubt.",
      "Sesko's absence since the draw at Tottenham should mean Amorim starts the striker on the bench particularly with other options available to him. Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are both capable of playing as false nines if required and this should allow the Slovenian to be eased back into first-team football.",
      "United predicted XI vs Bournemouth: Lammens; Mazraoui, Heaven, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha",

      "Since Ruben Amorim's arrival at the Theatre of Dreams, Manchester United's formation has been questioned seemingly non-stop. But no matter what's been said on the outside, the Portuguese has remained wedded to his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "It's taken some getting used to. And not all former Manchester United players are on board - perhaps most notably Paul Scholes, who even after last week's 4-1 win over Wolves saw fit to let rip about Amorim's favoured shape.",
      "\"Right away, that’s a no. Man United never do that,\" the Old Trafford icon said on The Good, The Bad, The Football podcast. \"They can’t do that. They just can’t, it’s been proven over years and years and years.",
      "\"And I’m talking about even before Sir Alex Ferguson, it was always 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2. Entertaining people. He hasn’t got that in him.\"",
      "But perhaps the ex-Sporting Lisbon and Braga boss could be about to rip up the rule book. During a team meeting before the thrashing of lowly Wolves at Molineux, Amorim is believed to have told his players \"a change is coming\".",
      "Since then, as first revealed by The Athletic, United have been dedicating time in training to stepping away from a back three and moving forward with a back four, utilising a 4-3-3 formation. Such a move would mark a major change for the United boss.",
      "But with the Africa Cup of Nations fast approaching, Amorim is aware that three of his key men - Amad, the ultra-consistent Noussair Mazraoui and this season's biggest goal threat thus far, Bryan Mbeumo - are all heading to the tournament. That trio have made up the entirety of United's right-hand side in recent games but Monday night against Bournemouth might well be the last time he can call upon them for some time. Thus, a solution is required.",
      "Speaking pre-match, Amorim hinted he is open to change - as well as offering that a switch to a three-man midfield could afford Kobbie Mainoo more game time.",
      "\"The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing,\" Amorim explained. \"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot.",
      "\"We need to adapt a little bit the way we are going to play the games, and that is a good opportunity to do that because we cannot think that we are going to play the same way without Amad, Bryan and Nous (Mazraoui), but especially Amad and Bryan because of the characteristics. That is really hard to get.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed a decrease in sponsorship revenue in their first quarter financial results. The sponsorship revenue was £47million, which is a decrease of £4.8 million over the prior year.",
      "That means sponsorship revenue has dropped by 9.3 per cent due to changes with the club's sponsorship agreements, following the expiration of the training kit deal with Tezos.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured in a Tezos-sponsored hoodie in unveiling pictures when he signed from Wolves, but the deal had expired by the time of Bryan Mbeumo's arrival.",
      "Although the sponsorship revenue has decreased in the latest figures, United sources have stated that sponsorship revenues were up slightly, if the training kit blow is excluded.",
      "United are braced for further sponsorship uncertainty, though, because their sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the season.",
      "In the summer of 2022, DXC began to sponsor the sleeves of United's kits under an agreement believed to be worth £20million per season, but the deal will conclude after 2025/2026.",
      "For four seasons, DXC has been featured on the club’s home, away and third kits, providing global brand exposure for the global tech company. The multi-year partnership has also seen DXC use their expertise to improve the way United engage with fans through their digital platforms.",
      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in and sponsoring the sleeves.",
      "The expiry of the DXC deal means United are in discussions to find a new sleeve sponsor and training kit sponsor.",
      "Sources have outlined that there is a 'strong pipeline' of potential new sponsors.",

      "Sam Mather is set to leave Manchester United in the January window. Mather missed out on an exit in the summer window due to talks collapsing with Turkish club Kayserispor, but his situation will be revisited.",
      "Mather, 21, is keen to leave United in an effort to kickstart his career in the professional game, and he is attracting interest from clubs in Turkey, Germany and Greece ahead of January.",
      "Discussions have taken place regarding the youngster's future, and United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward. United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",
      "United insisted on including a buy-back clause during discussions to sell Mather, which is common practice for departures from the academy, but the UAE club did not agree.",
      "Mather was forced to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start. He has continued to train with the first-team and has made appearances in four academy fixtures to keep ticking over.",
      "The winger scored a brace against Norwich in his first appearance of the campaign, but he has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career.",
      "Mather has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role.",
      "His contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "Andrei Kanchelskis looked totally unrecognisable upon his return to Manchester United this week for a tour of the Carrington facilities.",
      "The Russian winger, who was instrumental in ending United's 26-year wait for a league title, is fondly remembered for his hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over local rivals Manchester City in 1994. The club shared heartwarming footage of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season during his tour, a campaign in which he played a pivotal role in securing the domestic double.",
      "Known for his blistering pace and nimble footwork, Kanchelskis' lean, tall physique often gave defenders a lot to deal with during his time in the Premier League. Almost two decades after hanging up his boots, he still sports a full head of hair, albeit styled more slickly than the curtain hairstyle he wore during his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The skillful winger had a successful footballing career, representing both the Soviet Union and Russia internationally. He also played for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division team Dynamo Bryansk. After retiring, he served as sporting director at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before transitioning into management with various teams across central Europe.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, the ex-winger was gifted a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season and enjoyed a trip down memory lane as he toured the training facilities.",
      "The United icon will be using his trip to England to gather fresh insights and inspiration before his side's domestic campaign begins in March. Kanchelskis had an exceptional 1994/95 season with the Red Devils, during which he claimed the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "The attacker then made a surprising switch to Merseyside when Everton secured his signature for a club record £5million. Since then, he has maintained cult hero status at both clubs, a reflection of his exceptional ability on the pitch.",
      "Kanchelskis was accompanied by his son Andrei - a devoted Everton supporter - and also dropped by the Toffees' training complex this week. He met up with David Moyes and witnessed their victory against Nottingham Forest at the new ground.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Old Trafford, he said: \"Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",
      "\"He was always angry for me and Giggsy. But it was an excellent time and thank you very much Man United, it is still in my heart.\"",

      "Diego Leon's future is up in the air ahead of the January transfer window. Leon has exclusively played in Manchester United academy fixtures this season and staff have been pleased with his progress.",
      "That does not necessarily mean Leon will receive an appropriate loan offer in the January window. The youngster has played for the Under-21s and interest may be thin on the ground.",
      "Leon's representative, Renato Bittar, spoke in Paraguay about January, saying: \"We still don't have it clear if he's going to go out on loan now, we have to keep watching. He's evolving and that's positive.\"",
      "Bittar added that it “would not be ideal” to interrupt his current season with a move away.",
      "For Leon to leave in the winter window, a club would have to submit a convincing development plan with the promise of regular game time, which could be unlikely to arrive in the middle of the campaign.",
      "It's understood that coaches believe Leon has plenty to work on. Academy fixtures have helped Leon improve, while staying in the building would allow him to continue joining first-team training sessions.",
      "United unveiled Leon as a first-team signing alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in August. The defender was included in the United States pre-season tour squad in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "Before Leon travelled to Manchester, he spoke to local journalists at an airport in Paraguay, saying: “I’m going to kill it in the pre-season, and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them [first-team].\"",
      "The youngster's transfer made headlines in his homeland and Leon discussed the impact of his move.",
      "\"For Paraguay, to have a player playing here at United is huge,\" he told club media. \"I think for Paraguayans, they’re very proud to have someone from there playing in a club as big as Manchester United.",
      "\"It is an amazing, unique feeling to represent your country for all the people of Paraguay. I don’t know, it has no explanation - for my family it is an immense sense of pride to see me play with my national team.\"",

      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",

      "Ruben Amorim is set to be hit particularly hard by the tournament's selection, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both big losses. They'll link up with Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, while Noussair Mazraoui will represent hosts Morocco.",
      "The tournament hosts have made it to at least the semi-final stage of the past two AFCON competitions. This is worth bearing in mind given Morocco tend to be a perennial contender and enters their own competition as favourites this year.",
      "It's also worth highlighting that in addition to being absent for fixtures, those venturing deeper in the tournament won't return to club duty straight away. And any players that get their hands on the title may be entitled to a few extra days to lap up their achievement before coming back to England.",
      "Morocco are the clear frontrunners with the bookmakers to win a first AFCON crown since 1976, while seven-time champions Egypt are second in the stakes. The Atlas Lions are heavily backed to top Group A ahead of Zambia, Mali and Comoros, while Egypt appear to have a slightly harder line-up against South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe in Group B.",
      "The competition doesn't get underway until December 21, although players will start to link up with their sides imminently. The tournament will conclude in Rabat on January 18, meaning some players could be away for a full month.",
      "During that span, there are six rounds of Premier League action due to be played. This includes a particularly demanding three-week period between December 20 and January 8, across which each top-flight club will play five times.",
      "Some of those Premier League outfits missing players over the next month face more testing periods than others. At least on paper given the current table and how teams are performing at present.",
      "For example, Aston Villa will face United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace (in that order) between December 21 and January 7. Brighton also has a testing run of fixtures over the next month or so, with Sunderland, Arsenal, City and Bournemouth each on the agenda while the AFCON is on.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“The front four have been excellent for United, they really have,” Gary Neville said towards the end of the first half in a game in which the Old Trafford fans were treated to the most dynamic and fluent attacking display of the Ruben Amorim era while also enduring one of the weakest defensive performances, as four at the back brought out the best and worst of them.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Amad Diallo were indeed brilliant, zipping passes into each other and creating chances seemingly at will with the ball on a string between them against a horribly shaky Bournemouth defence that had conceded 13 goals in five games before stopping the rot with a clean sheet against Chelsea.",
      "MAILBOX: Mainoo ‘almost Maguire levels of slow’ as loan now best option for Man Utd",
      "And yet, had it not been for a pretty horrific goalkeeping blunder from Djordje Petrovic, who would have saved Casemiro’s tame back-post header on the stroke of half-time had he merely stood still rather than collapsing into his own net and allowing the ball to bounce over his gloves, Manchester United would have gone into the break level with a side they had almost entirely dominated after those forwards didn’t quite deliver “everything you want”, as Neville claimed was the case on commentary.",
      "Amad Diallo’s header from roughly half a yard into an open goal contributed 0.99 to a first-half xG of 2.62 compared to Bournemouth’s 0.99. The hosts’ 17 shots was more than any other Premier League side in a half of football this season.",
      "Those ‘underlying numbers’ are typically used to offer hope of a better future. “If they could only finish their chances” – that sort of thing. But we would contend with the suggestion that United being 18th in the Premier League for goals minus expected goals (G-xG) with a score of -2.8 – above only Wolves (-5.6) and Crystal Palace (-7.2) – is a good thing, particularly when joined on negative scores by Brentford, Liverpool, Leeds, Brighton, Everton and Nottingham Forest. That doesn’t feel like a gang you want to be a part of.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ sublime free-kick, which kissed off the bar to draw United level at 3-3, and Cunha’s relatively simple finish to make it 4-3 means they actually finished the game with a positive score having accrued an xG of 3.27, but that pair were 459th and 465th respectively among 468 players for G-xG before this game and played their part in failing to get this game won in the first half before their defensive teammates ensured they didn’t claim all three points in the second. Cunha had eight shots and just two on target.",
      "Luke Shaw was horribly weak before the break in being brushed off the ball before Antoine Semenyo bore down on goal as Ayden Heaven watched on. We know he’s young, but you need only know that the currency of football is scoring goals to come across and close Semenyo down in that situation. It was bizarre.",
      "The cobbled-together defence were ripped open within 40 seconds of the second half as Evanilson gulped down the medicine prescribed by Dr Manchester United to score his first goal since August after Semenyo netted for the first time since early October.",
      "Familiar problems in playing Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes at the base of midfield were exposed by Marcus Tavernier five minutes later as he tore through the centre of the pitch before being brought down by Casemiro and firing in the resulting free-kick past Senne Lammens as the United goalkeeper mistimed his jump to give himself little chance of making the save.",
      "And after Fernandes and Cunha got Manchester United back in front, Junior Kroupi came off the bench to again take advantage of the Red Devils’ soft centre with a brilliant touch and finish past Lammens to make it 4-4 after Bournemouth swarmed United from a throw-in. David Brooks could so easily have made it 5-4 but was denied twice by Lammens.",
      "All United fans should, and we suspect the vast majority will, vote for Amorim to persevere with four at the back. It made for a performance of stunning attacking verve and while Bournemouth’s typically intense style of play poked at gaps in the rearguard, Heaven and Shaw won’t ever be paired at centre-back together again and teething problems are to be expected.",
      "Please, Mr Amorim, don’t make us beg. More of that. Much, much more of that.",
      "Amorim has confirmed that two players on top of Sesko and Maguire are injury doubts ahead of Man Utd vs West Ham.",

      "Manchester United star Matheus Cunha answered with just three words when asked by an Arsenal fan if he was going to join the north London club.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘wants another attacker in January’ and it’s easy to see why, as Manchester United are already overly reliant on two summer signings…",

      "Unfortunately I think we’ve reached that point where Mainoo leaving, albeit on loan, is best for all parties.",
      "I understand why Amorim is reluctant to play Kobbie in the midfield pivot. He is almost Maguire levels of slow and too often have opposition players simply glided past him through the middle. The work demanded of the two midfielders is beyond what Mainoo can offer, fair enough.",
      "What I fail to understand is why he’s not at least getting some minutes as one of the 10s. Mainoo excels in the small spaces, his control and dribbling are fantastic, he can beat a few men then shoot, or pass well enough to create a shooting chance for a team mate, or simply rotate his position to drag away a defender. This is the essence of what Cunha is tasked with in Amorim’s system.",
      "Cunha has only played 63% of the available league minutes so far and decent chunks of that in the striker role. So really that left 10 position has been available for about half the games so far and Mainoo hasn’t been played there once. It’s kind of baffling really. Mount has had a few good games and I’m pleased about that but even Zirkzee is getting more minutes at the moment and he’s been consistently bad.",
      "If there was some personal thing, or disciplinary issue then we’d know about it. Amorim has not been hesitant in publicly revealing such things previously. He seemingly just does not rate him. Whatever Amorim looks for in his players, that one indescribable quality which makes us like people, he doesn’t see in Mainoo.",
      "A loan away to Napoli seems like a great option at the moment. Let him go and play, rekindle his development in a league where his qualities should shine. Then in the summer we’ll see, perhaps the manager changes his mind. That feels unlikely though and so if Amorim continues in the job then a sale would be the only realistic option.",
      "Some fans will never forgive the manager if that is the case and they shouldn’t. There is very little which emotionally connects us with our football clubs anymore. A prodigiously talented local lad coming through the club’s academy to score the deciding goal in an FA Cup final is just about as good as it can get. Keeping that player from the fans is bad enough, selling him would be tragic.\nDave, Manchester (writing before the Bournemouth game so perhaps I’ve poked fate sufficiently and Kobbie comes on to score the winner)",

      "Amorim needs to shut the f*** up and start winning games, stop naming and shaming our own players for no rhyme or reason other than to justify his own stupidity. Stop talking, start winning. All he has done since coming to United is talk a big game with zero follow up in results.",

I have supported every United manager since Fergie till the day they were sacked, no questions asked, even LVG & ETH. But never has one manager been so hellbent on randomly just putting down his own players for no actual reason. When others did it at least there was an agenda to either motivate them or throw them out of the team.",

Davies was actually a good shout. But that’s a change to be made at half time along with some tweaks to a moribund attack. You’re probably going to get a lot of letters about this, but Davies and Paulhina coming on at 2 – 0 down is madness. A lot of fans want this to work out – they don’t want another manager, but those substitutions are impossible to understand.",
      "Luckily, Spence mugged him off again. Which means he’s going to have to bare his teeth. Frank has hit rock bottom, but he’s not dead and buried. Spence can’t play on Saturday if Frank wants to be taken seriously. He talks about burning inside, but I don’t see any fire in his belly. He has a pragmatic style of football and a pragmatic personality. Romero seems to like him. Others think he’s a doughnut. Those that think he’s a doughnut need to be dealt with. There’s also the small matter of the football getting better and him settling on a system that works against an improving LFC but learning that he can’t be everyone’s mate is his biggest challenge.",
      "Two choices – either he throws Spence under the bus – no one’s going to use it on LinkedIn as a way to motivate teams, but it might buy him some respect and time. Or he goes full Pacino in ‘Any Given Sunday’, pours his heart out and tells them he doesn’t like the face he sees in the mirror anymore. Either is fine. Either will show he’s burning inside…but it’s now time to mean it.",

      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made ten appearances off the substitutes’ bench in the Premier League – but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",

      "READ: Ruben Amorim stands accused of ‘rampage’ as THREE kids ‘brutally’ attacked",
      "The report adds: ‘Mainoo’s exasperation over his current situation at Old Trafford barely needs stating. He feels frozen out by a manager who has yet to start him in a Premier League game this season and wants to leave on loan next month in pursuit of regular playing time. Napoli are heading a disorderly queue of more than a dozen clubs eager to take the 20-year-old.’",
      "It is also understood that ‘there are figures within the club who are very uneasy about the player’s predicament and what a potential exit could signify’.",

      "Brown told Football Insider: “Mainoo will push to leave in January, I have no doubt.",
      "“It’s crazy the way he’s been treated, but Amorim isn’t the only one to blame, Man United were testing the waters about interest in him during the summer.",
      "“All of the noise coming out of the club was that they would be prepared to let him go for the right price because of their financial situation.",
      "“Nothing ended up happening, but it’s something they looked into, and the player was made aware of that which left him a bit unsettled.",
      "“If you keep telling a player he’s not wanted by the club and the manager, even if you later change your minds, he’s not going to want to stick around.",
      "“Mainoo works hard, he’s a creative player, an excellent passer of the ball. He’s not a powerhouse or a flying machine, but he’s a very, very good footballer.",
      "“The fact he continues to be left out of the side and isn’t even coming off the bench, he could go and start every week for a lot of top clubs in Europe.",
      "“He knows that, and he knows there’s interest, it won’t come as a surprise to anybody but if the chance comes up he will want to jump ship.",

      "Sources close to the club have told The Athletic that ‘a significant amount of time during training sessions in preparation for the visit by Bournemouth today (Monday) has been dedicated to the side lining up’ in a 4-3-3.",
      "The report adds: ‘That can, in part, be attributed to United practising pressing schemes, with Amorim working on a 4-3-3 defensive system. But together with his message to the players before the Wolves game, and his statements in press conferences, an evolution from his back-three dogma seems to be a call he is seriously deliberating.’",

      "“We need to adapt a little bit the way we are going to play the games, and that is a good opportunity to do that because we cannot think that we are going to play the same way without Amad, Bryan and Nous (Mazraoui), but especially Amad and Bryan because of the characteristics. That is really hard to get.",
      "“They have more or less the same characteristics, the both of them, and we are losing them for a few games. But it’s a good opportunity for us to try to play in a different way.”",
      "Amorim later added: “I think we need to work on the variability of the way we play, especially in the build-up. I think I need to find different ways to take all the juice from the team, from the squad. I’m just trying to find out solutions to win more games.”",

      "Man Utd concentrated on new attacking signings, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all joining, as they were the fifth lowest scoring side in the Premier League last term as they finished 15th.",
      "However, by concentrating mainly on the attack, many fans and pundits think they made a major error by failing to sign a new midfielder.",
      "But transfer expert Fabrizio Romano recently insisted that Man Utd are now looking to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "Romano told his YouTube channel in November: “Ruben Amorim sends clear indications in public and in private for Manchester United in the January transfer window. In private, the conversations have started between Amorim, the board, and the management of Man Utd ahead of the January window.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim stands accused of ‘rampage’ as THREE kids ‘brutally’ attacked",
      "“I told you about the midfielder. I told you that Man Utd are looking for that position. But just in general, Amorim and the management of Man Utd are talking about the January window, the opportunities, and what to do with the players who want to play more: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "“For Zirkzee, West Ham and also Roma have called in recent weeks. So, this will be an opportunity for several clubs, and we have to see what Man Utd want to do, if they want to let him go or not.”",
      "It’s unlikely Man Utd will be able to stretch their January transfer budget to meet the asking prices of reported targets like Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson or Carlos Baleba.",
      "Real Madrid midfielder Valverde is another midfielder who’d require a huge fee, more likely to be met in the summer, and reports in Spain claim that Man Utd ‘are prepared to offer a staggering €120m (£105m)’ to convince the La Liga side to sell ‘Xabi Alonso’s biggest critic’, which would be a club-record deal for the Red Devils.",
      "The report adds: ‘In England, Valverde is considered an ideal player for the dynamic and physical style United seeks. His ability to arrive late into the box, his power, stamina, and versatility fit perfectly into Amorim ‘s plans . The English club doesn’t want a loan; they want a permanent signing to strengthen their midfield and give them complete control of a player they consider strategic for the coming seasons.’",
      "The Uruguay international is ‘seriously considering a change of scenery’ in the summer with the ‘prospect of being an undisputed starter and leader of the midfield is an attraction that is beginning to outweigh his attachment to Real Madrid’.",
      "The report continues: ‘Manchester United understands that this could be the perfect opportunity to acquire an elite player who still has great potential. The €120m offer not only demonstrates the English club’s ambition but also makes it clear that they are prepared to negotiate quickly if Real Madrid agrees to let them go. Those close to Valverde view the possibility of leaving and playing in his ideal position favorably.’",

      "Ruben Amorim goes on rampage against Man Utd academy with three popular stars singled out",
      "The use of the word ‘rampage’ by The Sun here is – and we do not say this lightly – absolutely mental.",
      "A ‘rampage’ is ‘a period of violent and uncontrollable behaviour by a group of people’. It is not ‘a slightly odd series of comments by one man quite obviously getting fed up of being constantly asked about Kobbie Mainoo‘.",
      "Let’s park the concept that Amorim is probably right for a minute, and wonder if a man can go ‘on the attack’ by pointing out that he played Toby Collyer, Harry Amass and Chido Obi last season, so it’s hardly like he is averse to playing Manchester United Academy players.",
      "He was literally asked if Mainoo could play in the Casemiro role and pointed out that Collyer had played there last season but added:",
      "“He is from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich and he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it’s not because he’s from the academy or whatever. It’s the situation that’s happened.”",
      "Amorim has a point. And it was clearly neither a ‘rampage’ nor an ‘attack’, just a man getting rather frustrated at being asked seven straight questions about a player not currently in his team.",
      "This is so very clearly the result of one of those post-press conference huddles where everybody decides that the ‘line’ is an Academy attack, despite it being very clearly absolutely nothing of the sort.",
      "What Amorim said was this about Mainoo:",
      "“Of course, he’s not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone had.",
      "“Especially last year, everyone had. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying, sack the manager.”",
      "Again, he has a point. He was playing Academy players when United were losing games and he was under pressure, so why is he getting flak when he is not playing Academy players and United are in better form?",
      "As for ‘popular stars’…what an absolute load of bollocks. There is no world in which Harry Amass is described as a ‘popular star’ unless you are trying to have a needless dig at Amorim.",

      "That hyphen makes us itch, but not as much as this blatant weaponisation of some pretty anodyne quotes to suggest that Amorim has launched an unsolicited attack on the United Academy.",
      "‘Amorim has insisted he won’t be swayed by sentiment’? What an absolute dick. Won’t somebody please think of the children. Especially the 21-year-old ones.",

      "In an effort to rationalise keeping Mainoo on the bench, Amorim said: “He (Collyer) played (for the United first team). He’s from the academy. He played here.",
      "“He went to West Bromwich. He’s not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it’s not because he’s from the academy or whatever.",
      "“It’s the situation, what’s happened. I don’t know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let’s see after this match.",
      "“Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in the Under-21s.",
      "“All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!”",
      "United legends Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, and Nicky Butt have all claimed that Mainoo – who has zero Premier League starts this season – should leave Old Trafford for the good of his career.",
      "“Sometimes they don’t have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here, always winning. So it’s hard for them to see their club in this situation,” Amorim said.",
      "“I take that naturally. It’s a fact that me as a manager of Manchester United, I think we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season.",
      "“The problem is that me, as a manager, I’m not doing good enough and I can accept that. So that is the only problem. Not winning is the issue.",
      "“If I’m winning I can go to the games on a horse, arrive there, play with just two defenders and everything will be fine.",
      "“At Sporting there was no issue because we were winning all the time. So I understand and that’s okay.”",
      "Amorim continued: “No, I didn’t speak with him, not about that (transfer interest). I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but not about that subject.",
      "“The team comes first and I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy, and I understand that every individual has their goals.",
      "“The problem is that we are playing with two midfielders and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I’m seeing him. Maybe if we play with three midfielders, Kobbie will have more minutes.”",

      "But we do once again find ourselves with a pretty clear favourite to become the fifth manager out on his ear this season, with Thomas Frank in big, big trouble after Tottenham’s latest abysmal showing in a 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Arne Slot has had a couple of wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, while Scott Parker and Daniel Farke still remain in both relegation and sack race trouble.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Victory over Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now 10 wins in 11 Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though, but spangling Tottenham will have gone down enormously well with his boss for sure.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest and Leeds have to be a concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "But derby defeat at Sunderland will inevitably sting, and the reality is that Howe and Newcastle remain for now behind Tottenham in the league, and that is not the place any self-respecting club should currently find themselves, all things considered.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Victory at Burnley has made it three wins from four, lifted Fulham away from the relegation battle and towards the mid-table strivers, and significantly lessened the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options that prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. Dubravka has made more saves than any other keeper having faced 17 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding three to Manchester City from a PSxG of 1.7. The number is damning but the Palace keeper passed the eye test, especially around Erling Haaland’s brace, and to expect more in the face of Phil Foden’s 20-yarder feels harsh.",
      "",
      "Only Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. On Saturday, like Pickford, he conceded two from a PSxG of 1.2 at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest.",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and looked a little lost. Made one excellent save v Sunderland and stopped all fur shots on his goal taken by Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1’. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regain shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest and not great against former club Manchester United. Then, at Arsenal, he was just plain unlucky.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Conceded eight goals in his last four Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he?",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "Sunderland will need all their momentum to avoid their season being AFCON-ed, while Man Utd are sure to suffer too. But Arsenal are unaffected and Leeds may profit…",
      "Newcastle, Spurs, West Ham, David Moyes and Scott Parker receive particular kickings, but Arne Slot, Sunderland and Unai Emery deserve plenty of praise.",
      "Eddie Howe will likely never respond to defeat by saying ‘it was nothing to do with me’. But Newcastle could do with figuring out who and what the issue is.",
      "Why don’t Manchester United try Kobbie Mainoo as a 10? If not, send him out on loan to a club like Napoli.",
      "Arsenal are top of the actual table – but these standings prove why the Gunners would be right to be wary while Manchester City sniff blood…",
      "Arsenal winning the title? That was always possible. Viktor Gyokeres flopping hard? That was always possible. Both those things happening? A great bit."

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly vetoed Kobbie Mainoo’s potential move to Serie A side Napoli ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Amorim over the summer with Man Utd investing over £200m in five new players, including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After being the fifth lowest scoring side in the 2024/25 campaign, Man Utd prioritised improving their attack with many fans and pundits frustrated they failed to bring in a new midfielder.",
      "With the area still being a problem, the Red Devils are set to bring a player in that position over the January transfer window, which could lead to Mainoo leaving Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim made it clear publicly that Mainoo would be fighting it out with captain Bruno Fernandes for a position in the Man Utd starting XI this season.",
      "That led to Mainoo attempting to engineer a loan move before the summer deadline before Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox convinced the youngster to stay.",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo in Premier League XI desperate for January move before 2026 World Cup",
      "However, Mainoo hasn’t started a Premier League game this season and there are rumours he now wants to leave Man Utd in search for regular game time before the 2026 World Cup in the summer.",
      "Napoli have been heavily linked with Mainoo as they hoped to bring him to Italy on a loan deal in the summer but Il Mattino (via Arena Napoli) insists that Amorim is now looking to block that deal.",
      "The report insists that Napoli are in ‘frequent contact’ with Mainoo’s representatives over a potential deal, Il Mattino states:  ‘The time for decisions is approaching, especially since Napoli wants to do everything possible to ensure a contract for a new midfielder can be filed as early as the reopening of the winter transfer window. Manchester United’s Mainoo is much more than a whisper, as sporting director Manna has been in frequent contact with the staff of the 20-year-old Three Lions international talent for days.’",
      "But Man Utd head coach Amorim is said to have ‘put up a wall’ over a deal for Mainoo, the report adds: ‘The point is another: Mainoo is completely appreciated, also because McTominay probably had a hand in recommending the good air of Serie A and Napoli. But United are in dire straits and Ruben Amorim, the highly controversial Portuguese manager, has put up a wall against his sale, despite his use being used sparingly.’",
      "The report continues: ‘The reality is that Red Devils fans are threatening fire and brimstone if one of their jewels leaves. So, it’s not easy. But Mainoo has said yes, he’s even open to leaving in January: the World Cup is upon us, his place in the England team is secure, but he wants to arrive in America after a season as a protagonist. At least half of it, given that the first half is now compromised.’",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has warned Ruben Amorim that he will always be a few defeats away from the sack after a challenging first year.",
      "Why don’t Manchester United try Kobbie Mainoo as a 10? If not, send him out on loan to a club like Napoli.",

      "On AFCON, Amorim added: “I don’t know if it’s going to be the same situation [with each player]. It depends on the games of every national team. They have their ideas about when they want the players.",

      "The Liverpool legend added: “The one line that stands out for me is ‘thrown under the bus.’ He’s thrown the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months. With the manager right now, he should be doing as much as he can to help the club get out of the worst run they’ve had since the 1950s and he hasn’t done that.",

But we accept it because he’s a superstar and he’s scored 250 goals and he’s given me as a Liverpool supporter some of the greatest nights of my life.”",
      "“You weren’t a big star before you came to Liverpool, you haven’t really won much for Egypt, no matter how big you are, you need help from your team-mates, your manager and fans, it’s important that he remembers that. When he talks after Leeds, it’s all about me, me, me.”",

      "‘I think there’s a strong possibility that he leaves the club in January on loan,” Meulensteen said in an interview with BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“I think he tried to leave in the summer to follow Scott McTominay to Napoli, but the club blocked the move. Players want game time and Kobbie is no different from any other player; he wants to play as much as possible and improve his game, which he can’t do from the bench at Man United currently.”",
      "He added: “Kobbie Mainoo played himself into the United team and the England set-up by playing absolutely fantastic football for someone so young. He established himself in this team as a starter, and the club and United fans love to see a young player from the academy being successful in the first team.",
      "“For whatever reason, Amorim doesn’t seem keen to play Kobbie which frustrates the fans and myself as I think he is a really talented player.",
      "“I think the reason his game time has been significantly reduced is due to the signings United made over the summer and the formation they play. Signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo meant Bruno Fernandes has slotted back into a more defensive position, where we have seen Mainoo play in recent years.",
      "“I can’t fathom why Mainoo and Bruno can’t play together, but maybe Amorim thinks they’re too similar. I would definitely like to see them play together. Kobbie is a top player with plenty of potential, but United are winning games at the moment, so he may have to wait it out for a while for a chance to start in this team again.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has warned Ruben Amorim that he will always be a few defeats away from the sack after a challenging first year.",
      "Why don’t Manchester United try Kobbie Mainoo as a 10? If not, send him out on loan to a club like Napoli.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is looking for a way out in January with some Red Devils figures ‘very uneasy’ by Ruben Amorim’s handling of the situation.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is set to change his formation in preparation for three players leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations, according to reports.",
      "There’s a bloodbath at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim goes on a ‘rampage’, with THREE kids in his crosshairs.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has cited three other academy players as examples to defend his decision not to play Kobbie Mainoo."

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘accelerated contacts’ to land a Real Madrid star who is also on the radar of another top Premier League club.",
      "United moved to improve their attack heavily in the summer transfer window. They landed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, each of which have had a positive impact on the attack.",
      "Mbeumo has had the biggest impact, but will soon leave for the African Cup of Nations, while Sesko is currently sidelined through injury.",
      "United are being linked with more attacking talents, and according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, have ‘accelerated initial contacts’ to sign Real Madrid star Arda Guler.",
      "The Turkish forward/attacking-midfielder has 10 direct goal contributions this season and is largely starting games in one of the most star-studded squads in world football.",
      "Arsenal are also said to be emerging as one of the most active contenders for Guler.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly a strong contender, as well, said to be looking to revitalise their attack with potential departures on the horizon – Mohamed Salah the biggest.",
      "Previously, reports have also suggested that Tottenham have watched him in action, alongside a number of other top clubs.",
      "But crucially for all of those clubs, the decision will depend on Real’s stance, per the report. They state if Real decide that Guler doesn’t fit into their long-term plans, compelling offers could be made.",
      "But there seems almost no chance that Real would give up on Guler.",
      "He’s 20 years old, is able to play in multiple positions, already has 32 direct goal contributions for Real and has started 18 of a possible 22 games this season.",
      "He has played a part in every game Real have played this term and has largely impressed in them.",
      "As such, were anybody able to prise him away, it would take a ridiculous offer, that it’s almost certain nobody is going to make.",

      "Xabi Alonso’s recent comments on Guler essentially guarantee that Real will not easily let him go.",
      "He said: “He has the ability to have different heights, as well as different influences, depending on what the team needs. He has very good feet, he knows how to organise the game and at the same time, when you are already in the final third, give the decisive pass.",
      "“Even arriving a little in the second line: in the goal against Valencia he made a break and crossed to Kylian [Mbappe]. And it depends on what we have around us, it can be adapted.",
      "“That quality gives us flexibility in our approaches. But Arda is growing a lot and we have, I think I said it at the Club World Cup, to invest a lot in him. Because he is a special, different player.",
      "“We need to demand from him, but also understand the different phases he has. Support him and push him a lot so that he continues to perform at the level he is doing. And that there is still room for improvement, without a doubt.”",

      "A very silly report has claimed that FC Barcelona have decided to include Marcus Rashford in a swap deal with La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy for around £26m from Premier League giants Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The England international secured his dream move to the Spanish giants after returning to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of last season.",
      "Barcelona were linked with alternatives, but they opted to take a punt on Rashford after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the forward’s versatility attracting head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "Rashford was only expected to be a bit-part player for Barcelona, but his great form has forced Flick into playing him consistently, as he has sparkled this season. He has six goals and eleven assists in his 21 appearances across all competitions.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Sunderland v Newcastle, Aston Villa, Xavi Simons, Oliver Glasner",
      "Therefore, it feels pretty likely that Rashford will join Barcelona permanently, though a new report from an outlet in Spain claims they have an ‘unexpected alternative’ in mind.",
      "Instead, Barcelona are said to have an outlandish plan to sign and offload Rashford in the same window, with the club reportedly including him in a £61m [70 million euros] swap deal with Atletico Madrid to sign former Manchester City star Julian Alvarez.",
      "Will this happen? No. But who would we be if we faulted their imagination?",
      "The report goes onto say that the ‘conditions are set’ for this deal, with a £61m fee and Rashford said to be used by Barcelona to acquire Alvarez.",

      "The report explains: ‘Atlético Madrid haven’t ruled out signing the English striker if Julián Álvarez ultimately ends up at Barcelona. Diego Simeone greatly appreciates Rashford ‘s profile, particularly his speed and directness in exploiting space from any attacking area. For the Argentine coach, acquiring a player of that calibre would be a way to compensate for such a significant loss as that of the Argentine striker.",
      "‘Thus, Atlético has set its conditions. They value Julián Álvarez at €120 million and Rashford at around €50 million, which is why they are demanding an additional €70 million for the deal to move forward and be finalised.’",
      "Regarding Rashford’s resurgence over the past year, former Man Utd player West Brown has explained why he was “always going to do well” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "“Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He’d been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple,” Brown told BetWright Casino.",
      "“He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don’t blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn’t in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn’t working.",
      "“It’s great to see how well he is doing now at Barcelona, he’s absolutely flying and he deserved to get back into the England squad. I’m sure he will have a great World Cup.”",
      "Marcus Rashford could reportedly return to Man Utd in the summer transfer window as Barcelona hit a ‘major problem’ over a potential permanent deal.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has suggested Spurs are “scraping around for players” amid links to Marcus Rashford, who he wouldn’t sign given a lack of loyalty.",
      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "Barcelona are uncertain about signing Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United, according to reports in Spain.",

      "Manchester United and Bournemouth put on one of the games of the Premier League season so far, trading blows in a thrilling 4-4 draw that saw Ruben Amorim experiment with his formation.",
      "The Portuguese has had to mount a staunch defence of his 3-4-3 system at times, but looked to be playing a tweaked or even entirely altered formation from kick-off. In fact, by the middle of the second half, he had thrown caution to the wind and gone for a 4-2-4.",
      "Whatever tactics Amorim deployed, they certainly worked with Manchester United dominant in the first half. Their 17 shots were the most by any Premier League team in the first 45 minutes of a game this season.",
      "Manchester United made a deserved breakthrough in the 13th minute as Amad Diallo nodded home on his final appearance before the Africa Cup of Nations. There was a brief VAR check for offside, with Matheus Cunha also scrutinised, but the goal stood.",
      "Despite all their good play going forward, defensive errors reared their heads again for Bournemouth's equaliser. Luke Shaw was too easily barged out of the way, allowing Antoine Semenyo to power forward. He then swept home, with the goal coming against the run of play.",
      "Deservedly though, Casemiro nodded Manchester United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner - the hosts' seventh from the set piece this season, with only Arsenal (9) scoring more.",
      "But just seven minutes after the break, the Red Devils somehow found themselves 3-2 behind. Bournemouth equalised with a brilliant finish from Evanilson 38 seconds into the second half, before Marcus Tavernier curled a wonderful free-kick into the bottom left corner.",
      "Then it was Manchester United's turn to score two quick goals to restore their lead as the pendulum swung back the other way. Bruno Fernandes scored a wonderful free-kick to level, before Cunha turned home inside a packed box as the ball fell kindly his way.",
      "You always felt another goal was coming and it was Bournemouth who hit back again to round off an incredible eight-goal thriller. Eli Junior Kroupi - just on as a substitute - added to the raft of high-quality goals as he squeezed through the central defenders before arrowing home his effort.",
      "The result moves Manchester United into sixth place on 26 points - level with Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Sunderland. Bournemouth are nudged up into 13th spot.",
      "\"We have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far. That's what makes the Premier League the greatest league, the greatest product or whatever you want to call it, in the world.\"",
      "\"I think it's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There was lots of that.",
      "\"Bournemouth were not at the races in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half.\"",
      "\"A fun game. We started really well, did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"We lost the concentration and they scored two goals. But we managed to get back to the game, we scored two goals again and then we have to finish the game.",
      "\"We need to think about not to go again, but to take calm and to close the game. A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.",
      "\"We need to focus on the performance today, different from the last two at home. That is also a point that we pay attention to. The result is the same and at one point, it's frustrating, but the performance is different.\"",
      "\"It had everything. Moments where you think it's a loss, moments where you think we have this one, we are comfortable.",
      "\"Even at the end, at the last minute, two clear chances, and I was thinking, 'maybe win this one'. It's just a point, it's not a lot in the standings, but I think we can take good and bad things from today.",
      "\"We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended. The second goal is a cheap goal, a cheap one for us to concede. The corner is not even a great header.",
      "\"We finished really well the first half. When we scored the 1-1 we were feeling comfortable and were finishing the half much better. That's why the goal we conceded just from the corner has hurt me because we were in a good moment.",
      "\"You didn't even know if we were happy finishing the game, or give us one minute more.\""

I thought it was really bland. The Everton one where obviously he kept three at the back against 10 men and there's no urgency, there's no throwing a kitchen sink at it. Same against West Ham, letting large parts of the game drift.",

      "\"If you're a kid coming to United - my two girls have come tonight, and they'll be thrilled walking back. They won't be happy that United haven't won, but they'll have seen a great game of football and that's what you come to Old Trafford for.",

      "\"I enjoyed what I've seen tonight from those red shirts.",

      "Gary Neville hails mid-game tactical tweaks from Ruben Amorim as Man Utd manager shows more flexibility in draw with Bournemouth but says 'big problems' remain",
      "Monday 15 December 2025 23:53, UK",
      "Gary Neville said Ruben Amorim finally got his system \"spot on\" during Manchester United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday Night Football - but the head coach was again left frustrated as he watched his side \"lose concentration\" to give up their lead three times at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim appeared to have departed from aspects, at least, of his trademark 3-4-3 formation from kick-off against the Cherries and watched his side rack up more first-half shots than any Premier League side has managed in a single game this season.",
      "There had been question marks before the game whether he would ditch the system altogether for the first time in his professional managerial career - and ahead of kick-off he had suggested he would need tactical flexibility when losing players to the Africa Cup Of Nations despite repeatedly defending the rigid set-up - but there appeared a new sense of fluidity not seen before by his United side to date.",
      "\"But Ruben Amorim has certainly done something different here tonight. Maybe it's Leny Yoro is coming over towards Antoine Semenyo.\"",
      "Later into the second half, with the hosts trailing 3-2, Amorim switched to a clear four-man defence with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Amad Diallo and Matheus Cunha either side of Bryan Mbeumo and substitute Benjamin Sesko in attack.",
      "\"We've been critical of Amorim for not having the right system and players on the pitch with the stubbornness for the system he plays, but in this period of the game, he's got it spot on,\" Neville said.",
      "\"The players you want on the pitch are there. Amad on the right, Mbeumo and Sesko up front, Cunha to the left, Mainoo and Fernandes as the midfield pair and then the back four.",
      "\"There's no excuses now.\"",
      "But for all their good play, United's continued inability to hold onto a lead saw them drop two more points through Eli Kroupi Jr's 84th-minute leveller, meaning they have let 10 points slip from winning positions this season - enough to put them joint top of the Premier League.",
      "He said: \"We need to focus on the performance today was different from the last two at home.",
      "\"That is also a point that we pay attention to. It's completely different. The result is the same. At one point, it's frustrating, but the performance is different.",
      "\"We lost the concentration and they scored two goals. But we managed to get back to the game. We scored two goals again and then we have to finish the game.",
      "\"We need to think about not to go again, but to be calm and to close the game. There were a lot of good things, but a lot of things to work on.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game.",
      "\"You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher was similarly unimpressed by Manchester United's defending but felt the quality of their attacking, particularly before half-time, was as good as he had seen from an Amorim side in the 59 games since he joined the club.",
      "\"It's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim,\" he said. \"They were fantastic, especially in that first 25 or 30 minutes.",
      "\"It was almost a throwback to Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, with Gary Neville playing. Fast attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There were lots of that.\"",
      "On the club's ongoing lack of clean sheets - of which Amorim now has the seventh-worst ratio in Premier League history - Carragher added: \"It's a big problem for them. They had problems at both ends of the pitch last season.",
      "\"We highlighted pre-match that they're improving in attack and we saw that again tonight. I thought the attacking players for Manchester United were fantastic.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Monday 15 December 2025 15:46, UK",
      "Morgan Rogers was Aston Villa's match-winner against West Ham on Sunday. Erling Haaland scored another two goals for Manchester City in their victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "But who is the Premier League's biggest game-changer?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically.",
      "Bruno Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough season for Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes's three goal involvements in Manchester United's last game against Wolves were the difference between a draw and a victory, winning the side two points. Before that, he won them three points by assisting both goals in the 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven of them have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo hasn't registered a goal involvement since scoring two goals and setting up another against Fulham in October but he still ranks third for points won, level with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 25 points after 15 games.",
      "Semenyo is second despite his recent goal involvement drought, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Mohamed Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed dip in form this season.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, has boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "And while Fernandes leads the way this term, Salah is undoubtedly the Premier League's biggest game-changer of the last 15 years.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",

      "Monday 15 December 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he is open to speaking to Kobbie Mainoo about his Manchester United future if the midfielder still wants to leave on loan in January.",
      "Mainoo, who requested a temporary switch in the summer, is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite the United head coach saying he views the academy graduate \"as a starter like the other players\" after the 4-1 win at Wolves.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has infuriated club legends Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Nicky Butt who have all said the 20-year-old should leave United rather than waste his career waiting for opportunities.",
      "Mainoo started for England in the Euros final in July 2024 but his lack of playing time has left him out of the picture under Thomas Tuchel, with reports claiming he wants to join Napoli on loan to get into the World Cup squad.",
      "Asked if he would sanction a January loan move should Mainoo request it, Amorim said: \"If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.\"",
      "Amorim insists Mainoo's reduced role is solely down to the fact he is competing for a starting position with Bruno Fernandes, who he says is \"really hard to take out of the team\".",
      "United captain Fernandes has started every league game and only been taken off early twice, in the 87th minute against Chelsea and 85th minute at Liverpool, highlighting how limited the opportunities are for Mainoo to play in that position.",
      "Amorim believes Mainoo has the characteristics to play in the other role in his midfield pairing that Casemiro regularly occupies but says the 20-year-old needs to think more about his defensive duties if he is to make it his own with so many attackers in the team.",
      "\"If you look at our team with [Matheus] Cunha, Bryan [Mbeumo], Bruno [Fernandes], that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "Casemiro had to work hard to convince Amorim he should be a regular starter after initially being displaced by academy midfielder Toby Collyer last season.",
      "Collyer has been on loan at West Brom this season and struggled for game-time in the Championship before being sidelined with an injury that he is currently having treated at United.",
      "\"[Toby Collyer] is from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich and he's not playing,\" said Amorim, who has faced criticism for his use of the academy.",
      "\"He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.\"",
      "Asked if he actually rates Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, like everyone else. The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing.",
      "\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot. Sometimes it's just the moment.",
      "\"I think I proved that if you change my mind [you can get into the team]. Casemiro is the biggest example. He was behind Toby and now he is a starter.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year.",
      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end.",
      "\"Kobbs is one more player that I understand all the interests. I understand how important it is. The hopes that you guys and English guys have. I also just want to win. If he's the right guy, I will put him in. No problem.\"",
      "Quite a few players over the past few days have had their say about Kobbie Mainoo over the last few days. I don't want to ask you about Mainoo again, but how frustrating is it for you to have ex-players and pundits having their say like this?",
      "\"I think it's normal. I think it's a fact that me as a manager of Manchester United, I think we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take it that naturally.",
      "\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here, always winning. So it's hard for them to see their club in this situation.",
      "\"About Kobbie, I can speak about Kobbie every press conference. Sometimes it's harder for me to speak after the game. It's always the same situation for me. All of them are the same.",
      "\"I know that for you guys, there are some players that you believe a lot and I believe a lot. But sometimes they have to make choices.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders in these games. We could change in the future. But Kobbie is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes. Sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "If Mainoo comes to you and says [a loan] is want I want in January, will you sanction that given how little play time he is getting?",
      "\"First of all, the team comes first. If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.",
      "\"But again, the focus is on this game. We will see if that happens.\"",
      "Have you not had that real conversation this season then in terms of him airing his frustrations?",
      "\"Not about that. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him.\"",
      "Are you a manger that wants your players to discuss that?",
      "\"I'm completely open. I think that is clear.",
      "\"What I don't promise is to… I have my ideas. That is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it, but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",
      "Could Mainoo not play in Casemiro's position because Casemiro sometimes comes off after 65 minutes…?",
      "\"Yes, he can. Against West Ham was Manu [Ugarte] that comes for Bruno's position. Bruno goes up because I was feeling with 10 minutes [to go], it is going to be long balls and second balls. I was thinking about that.",
      "\"I think it was against Everton I took Casemiro out, and I put Kobbie in because we were trying to play a different game.",
      "\"He can play in that position but it's hard sometimes. If you look at our team with Cunha, Bryan, Bruno, that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"Toby and his injury, he's returning here. He's from the academy, he played here. Went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to be the future. We'll see after this match.\"",
      "Do you rate Mainoo as a footballer?",
      "\"Of course, like everyone else. The problem is we are playing with two and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing.",
      "\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot. Sometimes it's just the moment.",
      "\"I think I proved that if you change my mind [you can get into the team]. Casemiro is the biggest example. He was behind Toby and now he is a starter.\"",
      "On that note, would you like to be more proactive in coming to him and saying, look, head coach, what do I need to do? What part of my game do I need to improve?",
      "\"It's like any other player. The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone had [opportunities].",
      "\"Especially last year, everyone had. [Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in U21. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying, sack the manager. You can see that I'm not worried. In that time, everybody [said that].",
      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Kaveh Solhekol",
      "Wednesday 10 December 2025 16:29, UK",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wants to stay at Manchester United to fight for his place in the squad amid interest from Roma.",
      "United are aware of the interest but are not thought to be actively looking to sell Zirkzee when the transfer window opens - and he has recently made an impact in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",
      "The United forward has a contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2029, with the option of another 12 months.",
      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",
