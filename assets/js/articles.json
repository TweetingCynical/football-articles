      "Manchester United are set to launch their opening bid for Botafogo star John Victor as they search for a new goalkeeper. A reshuffle between the sticks was anticipated this summer, with Andre Onana’s future looking uncertain.",
      "The former Inter Milan man has endured an inconsistent spell at Old Trafford since his arrival from Italy. It has been suggested that the Red Devils are open to letting Onana leave on loan this summer.",
      "And a few potential replacements have already been touted for him. Aston Villa star Emi Martinez is expected to be right at the top of their list, while Porto star Diogo Costa and Cruz Azul number one Kevin Mier have also been linked.",
      "Meanwhile Botafogo stopper John Victor emerged as a potential target following his starring role for the Brazilian side at the Club World Cup. It now appears that United are ready to make a tangible move.",
      "According to Goal Brazil, United have already submitted an enquiry to Botafogo and after a few meetings, they are ready to table an official offer. Victor would certainly be a more affordable option for the Red Devils given he has a £5.8m release clause written into his contract with his current club.",
      "Speaking last year, Victor’s agent Pedro Gutierrez admitted that there was growing interest in the goalkeeper. He said: “I have had many phone calls from clubs in Europe enquiring about John and that is no surprise after what he has achieved with Botafogo.",
      "\"There has been interest from clubs in England, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, but John would prefer to play in the best league in the world – the Premier League. Liverpool and Manchester City both have Brazilian goalkeepers in Alisson and Ederson and they have both been successful in England.",
      "\"John would like the opportunity to emulate those two and become the latest Brazilian goalkeeper to showcase his talents in the Premier League\".",
      "A potential move for Victor comes just weeks after Onana failed to commit his future to the Red Devils. Asked if he was set to stay at Old Trafford beyond this summer, he replied: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "Meanwhile, alternative target Emi Martinez also made some telling comments regarding his own commitment to Aston Villa. Speaking in the summer, he said: “My future? I don't know, I come here to play for the national team, and that's the only thing that matters to me right now,\" Martinez said. \"Do I want to move to a new club? The transfer window just opened, so there's still a long way to go.\"",

      "Newcastle United are pushing to sign Nottingham Forest star Anthony Elanga after making a second bid worth in the region of £55million. And Manchester United may be among the parties hoping to see a deal done.",
      "After seeing a £45m offer turned down, the Magpies have come back with a £50m bid with up to £5m in add-ons. If Newcastle can finalise an agreement with the Tricky Trees, United could reap the benefits of the sell-on clause they put in place two years ago.",
      "The Red Devils sold Elanga for £15m in 2023 and the Sweden international has thrived since. The Forest winger featured in all 38 Premier League games in 2024/25 and scored six goals and providing 11 assists as the club qualified for the Conference League.",
      "United are reported to hold a clause that entitles them to 15 per cent of any profit Forest make on Elanga. That would see Ruben Amorim's side rake in around £6m if their Premier League rivals do earn a £55m fee.",
      "Personal terms are unlikely to be an issue between player and club, per the Mail. Though Newcastle may yet find rivals for Elanga's signature, with Aston Villa also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "Newcastle, who can offer Elanga the opportunity to play in the Champions League, have a long-term interest in the player. The club failed to land the 23-year-old last summer when an approach was knocked back.",
      "On that occasion, the Tyneside team were willing to pay £45m fee which included an initial £30m payment, a swap deal for Miguel Almiron and two potential further £5m payments. Newcastle could find more success this summer however, and a greater fee for United.",
      "“ There is a lot of talk,\" Elanga said while on international duty last month, per Sport Witness. \"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",
      "“I guess there will always be scouts wherever I play,\" he added. \"As long as I stay focused and do my best in the match.",
      "\"I just keep my focus and what I can control. That’s what I can do on and off the field. I focus on the next day and action. That’s what I can do.\"",
      "United would be happy to see a boost to their funds as they attempt to add to their squad this summer. The Red Devils have already seen two bids rejected for Bryan Mbeumo and are looking to add a new striker to their squad."

      "Manchester United are set for a major reset this summer as they look to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign. The Red Devils finished 15th last season and were also beaten 1-0 by Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim has been backed to turn things around and United have already strengthened their squad with the £62.5million addition of Matheus Cunha, while teenage full-back Diego Leon has also joined.",
      "Plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut, with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Ollie Watkins both being targeted. Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all expected to complete permanent exits.",
      "According to a report from the Standard, Brentford have refused to lower their £63m asking price for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Mbeumo is keen on a move to Manchester United this summer, but Brentford have already rejected two bids for the forward. United's last bid was worth an initial £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons and Brentford are said to want more than the £62.5m the Red Devils paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"He had a fantastic season,\" Brentford's director of football Phil Giles recently said when asked about Mbeumo's future. \"We expected big interest in him; we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly demanding £25m for Jadon Sancho this summer, with the winger expected to complete a permanent exit after spending last season on loan at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues paid a £5m penalty fee to avoid signing Sancho permanently after he produced just eight goal contributions in 31 appearances in the Premier League. According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are ready to offer Sancho a fresh start.",

      "Elanga joined Nottingham Forest from United in 2023 and the report claims that the Red Devils will be owed around £15 per cent of the profits made if the winger is sold. Should Forest accept Newcastle's bid, United will receive £6m.",

      "Marcus Rashford has made contact with Barcelona, after their £58million deal to sign Nico Williams collapsed in spectacular fashion. Williams, 22, was in talks to join Barca but their well-documented financial issues meant that they were unable to guarantee the Spanish winger that they could register him with La Liga.",
      "After weeks of fraught negotiations, Williams decided to instead sign a new 10-YEAR contract with Athletic Bilbao. That's left Barcelona looking for alternatives to strengthen their attacking department.",
      "Liverpool star Luis Diaz is their first-choice target, although the Reds are reluctant to sell the Colombian forward. Bayern Munich recently made an approach for Diaz, 28, which was firmly rebuffed by Liverpool who insist he's going nowhere.",
      "As such there is a gap to be filled at Barca, who have reportedly identified Rashford as their Plan B - with Rashford dreaming of joining the La Liga giants. He wants to test himself in another country rather than staying in the Premier League and Barca are his No.1 choice.",
      "However, with United demanding a fee of £40m, any deal with Barca for Rashford would likely be a loan - unless they can negotiate a drop in United's price tag.",
      "Rashford has told the Spanish champions that he'd be willing to take a pay cut on his £325,000-a-week salary. His brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, was spotted meeting Barcelona sporting director Deco in May.",
      "United say that Rashford has informed the club that he wants to explore a move away, as have Red Devils team-mates Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. Matheus Cunha has also taken Rashford's No.10 shirt.",
      "Last month, the 27-year-old revealed that he wants to play alongside Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in a thinly-veiled come-get-me plea. \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" Rashford told Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Now the chances of him getting his dream move to Catalunya have increased. Athletic announced that Williams had signed a mammoth contract extension until 2035 on Friday morning.",
      "\"When it comes to making decisions, for me, the most important thing is to listen to your heart. I am where I want to be, with my people, this is my home,\" the Spain international commented.",

      "\"The step forward Nico Williams has taken with this renewal fills the entire Athletic Club family with pride and paints a picture of a future as ambitious as it is exciting,\" the club added.",
      "\"This latest display of loyalty marks a milestone in the history of the club and confirms a path of trust in the sporting project. He will continue to wear the number 10 inherited from Iker Muniain, with the Champions League as his new stage. His step forward in the face of dizzying offers is a resounding success for Athletic Club.\""

      "That move has appeared unlikely for much of the summer, with Barca prioritising a move for Spain winger Nico Williams. But amid worries over the Blaugrana's ability to register Williams if they paid his release clause to Athletic Bilbao, amid the club's financial issues, the player has duly signed a new long-term deal with Athletic until 2035, confirming that he won't be moving this summer.",
      "That offers an opening to Rashford, either on a permanent deal or on loan, particularly with Liverpool insisting that another Barca target, Luis Diaz, is going nowhere this summer.",
      "Sancho is looking to join Juventus after seeing Chelsea pay £5m to get out of spending £25m to sign him permanently after his loan spell, while Garnacho, who had been an important piece of Amorim's side for much of last term, is seeking an exit after falling out with the Portuguese. Frustrated at only being a substitute in the Europa League Final loss to Spurs, his post-match comments were the last straw and he was told by the United boss he can leave.",
      "Malacia has been out on loan at PSV Eindhoven, who decided not to make his loan move permanent for £8.3m, and has no future at the club after an injury hit spell, while Antony was a major hit on loan at Real Betis, who are eager to sign him permanently if they can negotiate an affordable price.",

Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

      "Marcus Rashford’s chances of moving to Barcelona have been improved after Nico Williams sensationally turned down a transfer. The Athletic Bilbao star was strongly linked with a switch to Catalonia this summer.",
      "Barcelona had identified him as a prime target this summer, with it being revealed that they were considering paying a £50m release clause written into his contract. But the move is now off the table after Williams put pen to paper on a stunning new deal with his boyhood club.",
      "Williams, 22, has signed a new 10-year contract with Bilbao that will extend his stay with the club until at least 2035. The fresh deal has also seen Williams’ release clause rise by 50% to around £75m.",
      "Speaking after his new contract was announced, he said: \"When decisions have to be made, for me, what weighs most is the heart. I'm where I want to be, with my people, this is my home. Aupa Athletic!\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bilbao have even sweetened the deal by offering Williams the club’s iconic number 10 shirt. Speaking about the switch, he said: “It looks great. Love it. It was Muniain’s number. I asked him for it. I’m proud to get this number 10 shirt from Muniain. And to make history as he did.”",
      "And while Barcelona will be left frustrated by the news that Williams will not be signing for the club, it might see them look at alternative targets. Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has already been linked with a move to Spain.",
      "United chiefs expect Rashford to leave on loan this summer after his fall-out with Ruben Amorim. A move to the Premier League also appears to be off the cards, with Rashford ruling out a switch to London, while he does not want to take a cut to his lofty wages.",
      "And speaking recently, he hinted that he would be open to signing for Barcelona. Asked if he would like to play alongside Lamine Yamal, he said: \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see.\"",

      "Nemanja Vidic has revealed the one player who he had a bust-up with at Manchester United. Legendary defender Vidic enjoyed a trophy-laden eight-and-a-half years with the Red Devils, winning five Premier League titles and one Champions League.",
      "The Serbian left United to join Inter Milan in 2014, one year after Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager. Vidic established himself as one of the toughest centre-backs in the Premier League and took his no-nonsense mentality into training.",
      "Former team-mate Ben Foster described him as 'scary' and 'horrible' during sessions but Vidic insists that he only ever had one bust-up inside the dressing room. Speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, he revealed that Brazilian midfielder Anderson was the team-mate in question.",
      "\"At Manchester United, I had one bust-up in the changing room and that was with Anderson,\" Vidic explained. \"It was something on the pitch then it got transferred to the dressing room. It was no big deal.\"",
      "Some United fans will be surprised by the 43-year-old's claim, as Patrice Evra is on record claiming that Vidic refused to speak to him for three months. The pair's fractious relationship even prompted Ferguson to move Rio Ferdinand to the left centre-back role so that Vidic wouldn't be near Evra.",
      "In 2021, Evra told United's official podcast: \"To be honest, we also fought. We had a fight, me and him, and didn't speak for three months.",
      "\"We played together and we didn't even say a word. I never told him to go left or go right. He was the same. Ferguson had to swap Rio Ferdinand to play on the left side with me.",
      "\"It was like that for three months until, after a game, I remember he came to me in the dressing room and gave me a high-five. Everyone was like \"finally\" because we were best friends together, Vida and me. We have a deep story together.\"",
      "Vidic says that he'd like to be back in the Old Trafford dressing room one day but as the United manager instead. Discussing what the future holds for him a decade after hanging up his boots, Vidic said: \"If I was to manage or coach anyone, it would have to be Manchester United. I like things when they're difficult and to change something from difficult to good, this is something I like to do.\"",
      "He added: \"I am open an opportunity to be a coach, or to work in football as a sporting director, or even the Serbian president of the FA - that was the plan a few years ago - it didn't happen but maybe it could happen in the future.\""

      "That departure has left Arteta with a vacancy to fill and it appears that he has turned to someone that he knows quite well in Heinze. As per The Athletic, the former Red Devils defender is set to be appointed at the Emirates as a replacement for Cuesta.",
      "Arteta and Heinze already have a prior relationship having been teammates at French giants Paris Saint-Germain. Explaining the impact that the Argentinian8 had on him, Arteta said: “The other inspirations were (Mauricio) Pochettino and Heinze, those two were next to me all the time, behind me, and they were guiding me in everything I had to do in my professional life, how I had to understand the game and they were inspirational to me.\"",
      "Heinze will join an already established team of coaches in North London that includes Albert Stuivenberg, set-piece coach Nico Jover, and goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana. All three have been at the club since 2021.",
      "Heinze represented PSG, Man United, Real Madrid, Marseille and Roma across what was a glittering career, winning league titles in England, Spain, France and Argentina. He was also named the United player of the year in 2005.",
      "The 72-time Argentina international retired in 2014 and has since moved into management with Argentinian sides Gody Cruz, Newell’s Old Boys, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield, while he also had a stint with MLS outfit Atlanta United. But he has been out of work since November 2023.",

      "He later fell out with then-Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag in September 2023 over his commitment levels in training and refused to apologise for publicly criticising the Dutchman's comments on social media. That led to him being frozen out from the first-team squad.",

The South African, currently managing Kenya's national team, says he wasn’t the most sociable team-mate at United and would often head straight home after training, which may have been misconstrued from the outside.",

      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates. He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.\"",
      "However, he went on to comment on Sancho’s main struggles with consistency, adding: “I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best everyday. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him, he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho might be on the verge of a permanent exit from Manchester this summer. Juventus have been linked with the Englishman and reports suggest they could be ready to meet United's valuation of around £25m.",
      "But the Turin-based club are not willing to do the same for Sancho's hefty wage demands, which reportedly exceed £300,000 per week as talks continue with his representatives. A swap deal could be on the cards too",
      "It's claimed that the Italians have offered Douglas Luiz, Tim Weah and Dusan Vlahovic to sweeten a deal for Sancho. United reportedly have not yet responded to that proposal and could prefer straight cash amid attempts to boost Amorim's budget.",

He added: “On the way back, and I’m not a good flier in general, the pilot turned to us and said, ‘It’s chaotic weather in London, it’s snowing, there’s thunder, there’s lightning.’ I was thinking, ‘What? It was 43 degrees when we left France.’",
      "“And the journey back was horrendous - I could see the pilot avoiding the dark spots on the radar. I was bricking it!",
      "“But, fortunately, we landed safely and, more importantly, managed to turn around the deal a few days later and eventually sign him. So, Brentford fans must know that I risked my life to sign Bryan Mbeumo!”",

      "Manchester United have a little under two months left of the transfer window - and the Red Devils really need to get down to work. They have already sealed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "But the spending is unlikely to stop there. United are in dire need of a new forward to potentially solve their goalscoring issues and appear to have identified their man.",
      "A new midfielder, left-back and winger could all be set to arrive before the window closes on September 1. But before that, exits might have to be the first port of call as United attempt to gather funds after missing out on a spot in Europe for next season.",
      "And there are already a few candidates to leave Old Trafford, with some potentially worth millions. Where does the land lie right now though?",
      "It’s fair to say that the Brentford forward is right at the top of United’s shortlist of signings. They’ve already had two bids turned down for the Cameroonian and while it appears that the Bees are open to selling, they will only let him go for a price they deem suitable.",
      "As it stands, United chiefs remain confident of reaching an agreement before the end of the week. They might want to move a bit quicker to get everything rubber-stamped but all the signs are pointing to this one getting done.",
      "From Brentford to Aston Villa now, United are interested in adding an out-and-out striker to their squad. Having been linked with a host of options, it appears that Villa star Watkins is now the outstanding candidate.",
      "United reportedly held talks with Villa regarding a deal in January only for nothing to come of their initial discussions. But they are now making a concerted effort to sign the England man despite Villa’s £60m asking price.",
      "One reason that United have turned their attention to Watkins is the ongoing furore surrounding Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting Lisbon striker was thought to be at the top of United’s list, only for him to prioritise a move to Arsenal.",
      "Even then, a deal has proven to be difficult, with Gyokeres accusing Sporting of upping their demands, threatening strike action and even turning down clear-the-air talks. It’s all gotten a bit messy but it appears that the Gunners are inching closer to an agreement, putting United out of the race in the process.",
      "One deal that is a lot easier to do is a move for young defender Diego Leon. He is set to fly to the UK this week to undergo pre-season testing.",
      "Leon has already suggested that he is ready to fight for his place at Old Trafford. He said: \"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this. When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Over recent days, United’s interest in Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Fabian Ruiz emerged but a deal looks somewhat tricky to do. The Spaniard has two years left on his contract in the French capital, while manager Luis Enrique apparently wants to keep him around.",
      "Ruiz would be a quality addition to their midfield options but this one just appears to be speculation for now.",
      "While Enrique wants to keep hold of Ruiz, the same could certainly not be said of Ruben Amorim and Marcus Rashford. The forward was exiled to Aston Villa last term, the Midlands side recently confirming that they will not be activating their option to sign him.",
      "Rashford has already made his preference clear having ruled out a move to London, while he also does not want to reduce his £300k-per-week pay packet. He has also expressed interest in a move to Barcelona, who are interested in a move despite their imminent capture of Nico Williams. It looks like this one could rumble on for some time.",
      "With Rashford primed for an exit, he could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, who has also fallen out with Amorim. Serie A champions Napoli were reportedly interested but that has not progressed.",
      "A potential swap deal with Chelsea involving Christopher Nkunku was touted but that looks slightly unlikely right now. The Blues could still move for him but again, that might be another one that gets more clarification later in the window.",
      "Sticking with Chelsea, they have already dealt a considerable blow to United’s transfer window this summer. The Blues had a £25m obligation to buy former loanee Sancho but paid a £5m penalty clause to back out of that agreement.",
      "He is now set to return to Old Trafford. Juventus have recently emerged as potential suitors in a sensational swap deal, while Napoli and Fenerbahce have also been linked in the past. It’s clear that Sancho won’t be a United player next season, it just depends on where.",
      "Fellow forward Rasmus Hojlund could also depart over the coming months. The Danish forward endured a woeful second season at Old Trafford, with it being suggested that United were happy to cut their losses.",
      "Inter Milan looked to be the most likely to move for him but they have since cooled their interest in the former Atalanta man. It was reported that United would only move for Watkins should Hojlund leave so his future could potentially be key to how the rest of the window plays out at Old Trafford.",
      "Brazilian winger Antony has been a disastrous signing at Old Trafford and he looks sure to leave. All the suggestions are that Real Betis will make a renewed move for the former Ajax man following his successful loan move last season.",
      "But the Spanish side would struggle to match United’s current demands. Reports in Spain suggest that an agreement over a move is still some way off despite Antony making his desire to return to Seville abundantly clear.",
      "Amorim has a decision to make over United’s number one position. Andre Onana has struggled to convince during his time at Old Trafford and according to reports, United would be open to letting him leave on loan.",
      "Ligue 1 side Monaco emerged as suitors for his services but have since cooled their interest. The Red Devils have picked out a few potential replacements but Onana will need to leave before anything progresses.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

Garnacho, who has fallen out of favour at United, posted on social media a picture of him wearing an Aston Villa top with Marcus Rashford's name and number on the back.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after falling out with boss Ruben Amorim, and Garnacho's provocative stunt was seen as him taunting the United boss after he, too, suffered the same fate as the England forward.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for United's 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao, prompting the winger – who turned 21 yesterday – to publicly criticise Amorim over the decision and reveal he was considering his future.",
      "That in turn convinced Amorim that Garnacho has no place in his future plans, with the club actively looking to sell the £50million-rated Argentina international this summer.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha said ex-skipper Keane would have dealt with Garnacho in the most brutal way possible – by subjecting him to a series of fierce tackles on the training pitch to show him he was out of line.",
      "“Back in my day, I think Roy would have welcomed Garnacho back to the training ground with a few crunching tackles to help him understand what he thought of him,” said Saha. “I can’t say for sure, but I really doubt Keane will agree with what Garnacho did.",
      "“It’s the type of things we see from new generations. To be honest, I can’t only blame Garnacho. The way the squad has been built, it’s why Garnacho thinks he has the right to do something like this.",
      "“It's why he thinks he can make stupid comments and say things on social media. He thinks he’s going to get something out of it and, right now, United are the club who are giving him the platform to act this way.",
      "“He already thinks he’s a top player, already makes demands, acts without respect. It’s a shame, but there are other factors than just the player. The club and the squad, they’ve already lost the leaders. The bad influences have already taken over. They think they’re bigger and better than they are.",
      "“Keane, Rio Ferdinand, David Beckham, Gary Neville, they would all make sure you understand what wasn’t allowed. They wouldn’t give players the luxury to act like this. He’s been let down because he’s been given too much responsibility for a player who hasn’t earned it yet.",
      "“It’s fine if you’re playing like Wayne Rooney. If you score 20 or 30 goals a season, do what you want, demand what you want. Garnacho has five goals and he’s carrying on like this. It’s crazy.”",
      "Asked if a potential swap deal involving Garnacho and Chelsea striker Christopher Nkunku would be a good move, Saha said: “Everyone can benefit from the move. It’s a win-win. United want players who are dedicated, work hard, are eager to play and who have talent.",
      "“We want players who want to play well, and there’s extra motivation in the year of a World Cup. I think Nkunku knows if he plays well, he can get back in the French squad for the summer. At the same time, he’s not the kind of player who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "“As for Garnacho, if he wants to go, get rid of him. I used to be a huge fan, but that’s over. Anyone like this, if they want to go, go. Even if you lose money, it doesn’t matter, because you can bring in a player who can behave as they should.”",

      "Romelu Lukaku has claimed that he never wanted a move to Manchester United but was swayed by his agent. The Belgian striker signed for the Red Devils in 2017 in a £75m deal.",
      "His switch came after a prolific spell with Everton having scored 87 goals in 166 appearances for the Toffees. And things started well for Lukaku at Old Trafford having scored 27 goals across his debut campaign.",
      "But things soon went awry having fallen out of favour during his second season, while he found the net just 15 times. Lukaku was eventually sold to Italian giants Inter Milan.",
      "The forward has now admitted that he was never clamouring for a move to United and instead wanted to return to former club Chelsea, only for then agent Mino Raiola and Jose Mourinho to convince him otherwise.",
      "Speaking to Koolcast Sport via Het Nieuwsblad, the now Napoli forward said: “I had already told everyone: I’m going to Chelsea. But suddenly Mourinho called me to say that Manchester United had made an offer.",
      "“I came back from vacation and suddenly there was an agreement with Everton. I said to Mino: ‘I don’t want this’, and then I decided now I’m doing everything myself.”",
      "After his exit from United, Lukaku managed to rediscover his goalscoring form, scoring 64 goals over two seasons before he eventually got his much-desired move to Chelsea. He was allowed to leave after just one season though, rejoining Inter on loan before a spell with Roma.",
      "Lukaku is now with another Italian side in the form of Napoli and helped the side to the Serie A title last term. Ironically, he could have ended up in Italy even earlier before he completed a permanent move to Everton, something that made him question his trust in agents.",
      "“It actually started in 2014. I signed with Everton at the time, but I could also go to Juventus, Wolfsburg and Atlético. That didn’t happen,” Lukaku added.",
      "“I ended up at Everton, no problem, but when I saw certain figures in my contract, I thought: something’s not right here. I started digging and then everything came out. A year later, De Bruyne moved to Manchester City and also started discovering everything. And then everything came out in the media.”",
      "Lukaku remains under contract with Napoli until 2027 and is set to be reunited with Kevin De Bruyne in Naples next season. Asked about the role he played, he said: “I spoke to him a few times and explained to him how things work at Napoli. I’m very happy that he’s joining us.

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",

      "Manchester United players will be returning to Carrington this week as they prepare for the start of their pre-season training.",
      "Most of the squad will be back with manager Ruben Amorim but MEN Sport reported on Friday that five players will be delaying their returns to Carrington. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have all informed the club of their desires to move elsewhere and, as such, have been granted an extended summer break to help them achieve these moves.",
      "Come Monday, it will be less than two weeks until United take to the pitch against Leeds in their first pre-season fixture of the summer. So the objective will be to ensure plenty of transfers are completed before then so Amorim can assess what he is working with at Old Trafford.",
      "That being said, MEN Sport has taken a look at three transfers which can be completed next week.",
      "This transfer is more a case of needing to be completed this coming week. The Bryan Mbeumo transfer saga has now rolled on for too long and United really need to get it done so they can start focusing on other areas of their squad - chiefly centre-forwards.",
      "There is no doubting that the Cameroonian would improve this squad but United had been hoping he would be a Red before the start of pre-season. That seems highly unlikely now considering that starts on Monday but nevertheless, a deal for the forward is a deal which can be completed next week if there is a breakthrough in negotiations.",

      "United, Juve and Sancho all want the deal so there shouldn't really be an issue, right? Well, a sticking point could be Sancho's salary which currently does not fit into the Turin club's wage structure.",
      "However, once a workaround is found for that issue, this looks like a deal that will carry steam quickly.",
      "This final transfer all depends on factors outside of the control of the Reds and Rashford. United need to sell their academy graduate this summer and they seem more than happy to do so considering Matheus Cunha is poised to be given Rashford's shirt number.",
      "The issue here lies with the lack of offers on the table. Barcelona is the dream destination for Rashford and they could come in next week considering their first choice, Nico Williams, has committed his long-term future to Athletic Bilbao.",

      "You don't have to be a fortune teller to predict how Onana's season will unfold. He will deliver a few excellent performances, but the inevitable mistakes will creep in sooner rather than later.",
      "Erratic is probably the perfect word to describe Onana. He is certainly not a goalkeeper who can be relied upon and can make embarrassing howlers at unexpected moments during matches.",
      "United allowed David de Gea to leave upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 because his mistakes had become too regular and some performances were indefensible.",
      "Onana has made a similar number of mistakes without having the previous class that De Gea had banked. It was still the correct decision to allow De Gea to leave because United needed a modern goalkeeper, but the feeling is they botched the succession and need a new No.1 stopper.",
      "That will have to be put on the back burner for now, though. United are prioritising other positions in the summer transfer window and Onana is expected to play a third season for the club.",

      "The total wages from Villa's most recent set of accounts for 2023-24 are £252million, compared to a revenue of £275.7million. That works out at over 90% but does include non-football staff, which UEFA discounts when calculating SCR based on a calendar year.",
      "Villa will likely have to reduce their wage bill this summer. Philippe Coutinho completing a permanent move to Vasco da Gama, as confirmed on Friday, will help toward that.",
      "As reported by Birmingham Live, Emiliano Martinez is one of the club's top earners and is a player they could possibly involve in a 'big sale' before turning 33 in September. However, it is said there will be no fire sale. United are linked with the goalkeeper and Ollie Watkins."

      "Heinze made 83 appearances for United across his three years at Old Trafford from 2004 and 2007 following his £6.9million move from Paris Saint-Germain. The former defender won one Premier League title during his time at United before going on to join Real Madrid.",
      "After further spells at Marseille, Roma and Newell's Old Boys, Heinze retired from professional football in 2014 and has since gone into coaching. Now, it seems that the former United star could be in the opposite dugout to his old club next season.",
      "The Athletic have reported that Heinze is ready to be appointed as a new coach for Arsenal to link up with Mikel Arteta's backroom staff.",
      "Heinze is expected to replace the Gunners' former coach Carlos Cuesta, who recently left the Emirates Stadium to take charge of Serie A outfit Parma.",
      "United are due to host Arsenal in the first match of the Premier League season on August 17. If an appointment is confirmed, it would see Heinze back at Old Trafford - but this time in the opposite dugout as a coach.",
      "Heinze has a wealth of experience in coaching already to his name - with his most recent job seeing him in charge of Newell's Old Boys, his former club, before his exit back in 2023.",
      "The ex-United defender also has experience managing in the United States with Major League Soccer outfit Atlanta United. Heinze began his coaching career in his homeland in Argentina, taking charge of Godoy Cruz, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield."

      "Manchester United are watching on intently as Newcastle reportedly push to sign their former winger, Anthony Elanga, from Nottingham Forest this summer.",
      "United sold Elanga in 2023 after he was offered a second chance by Ralf Rangnick when he was appointed interim manager. Once the current Austrian international team head coach left Old Trafford, so did the Swede's chances at the club.",
      "Erik ten Hag preferred his statement signing Antony on the right wing and, as such, Elanga was sold to Forest for what is believed to be a fee of £15m. Unfortunately for the Reds, their Brazilian winger failed to impress while the player they allowed to depart has since gone from strength-to-strength at the City Ground.",
      "The 23-year-old totted-up six goals and 11 assists in the Premier League last season - as Forest managed to surpass all expectations and qualify for the Conference League next season. Elanga's key role in that success has now made him a target with Newcastle particularly keen on his signature.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Newcastle are preparing to submit a third offer valued at £55m for Elanga this week. Our colleagues at Chronicle Live previously reported that a £45m bid had been rejected and that a £50m offer had been made.",
      "While the transfer does not directly impact United, there could be a tasty windfall in it for them this summer. It is understood that the Reds included a 20 per cent sell-on clause in the deal which saw Elanga swap Manchester for Nottingham.",
      "This means 20 per cent of the profit that Forest make will go straight to the Reds. If he was to be sold for £55m, then Forest would make a £40m profit and United would receive £8m in the settlement.",
      "It may not be a huge sum of money but when the Reds are currently looking for every means necessary to boost Ruben Amorim's budget, an extra £8m would come in handy. Newcastle have until 7pm on September 1 to try get their proposed deal for Elanga over the line."

      "Across the last three years, Tezos has been a visible partner for United, and a valuable one too, occupying one of the key pieces of the club’s sponsorship inventory. The club are working on a replacement, but there will be reasons why it takes a little longer than it may have otherwise done.",
      "It is a similar situation to the one that Chelsea found themselves in last season when it came to a front-of-shirt sponsor. The West London side had been wanting to achieve a figure in line with what some of their rivals had been able to bring in but a lack of competitive success and Champions League exposure meant that the value of the deals available weren’t as strong as hoped for.",
      "Instead of taking a lesser amount and tying themselves into it for a long period of time, the club opted to go without, instead partnering with Dubai real estate agents DAMAC for the final weeks of the season in a multi-million pound deal.",
      "United’s approach will be similar. They will know that accepting a lower fee than they have previously been able to would weaken their leverage when going to future deals. They want to ensure that they are not only holding the current value, but three years on from the initial Tezos deal, and taking into account inflation, they will want more than what was on offer to ensure that commercial revenues are growing and not diminishing.",
      "That is the challenge that is posed by a lack of Champions League football and the reputational damage that such a bad domestic campaign inflicted last season. United remains a globally recognised brand, but it isn’t associated with competitive success at the moment, nor does it look like that corner will be turned immediately, and getting major brands to part with significant sums of cash for training wear apparel exposure is a greater challenge than it previously has been.",
      "The club, without access to money from European football this coming season, needs to strike a good deal when it comes to renewing or bringing on board new commercial partners so as not to further impact what may be a challenging financial year during a period when they will be required to strengthen the squad in order to return themselves to Europe’s elite knockout club competition."

      "The Belgian striker switched from Everton to Old Trafford for a hefty £75million fee after an impressive stint at Everton, where he netted 87 goals in 166 games. Lukaku's first season at United started promisingly with 27 goals, but his form took a dip during the second season as he scored only 15 times and subsequently moved to Inter Milan.",
      "Lukaku candidly admitted his preference for the Blues over United, stating that despite informing everyone of his intention to move to Chelsea, Jose Mourinho's intervention and his then-agent Mino Raiola's influence swayed his decision. Speaking with Koolcast Sport and reported by Het Nieuwsblad, he said: \"I had already told everyone: I'm going to Chelsea. But suddenly, Mourinho called me to say that Manchester United had made an offer.",

His stay at Stamford Bridge was short-lived, however, leading to another term at Inter on loan and a subsequent spell with Roma, reports the Mirror.",
      "Lukaku, currently plying his trade with Napoli, contributed to them clinching the Serie A championship last season. His arrival in Italy could have occurred even before his permanent switch to Everton, prompting him to question the trust he placed in agents.",

      "\"I ended up at Everton, no problem, but when I saw certain figures in my contract, I thought: something's not right here. I started digging and then everything came out. A year later, De Bruyne moved to Manchester City and also started discovering everything. And then everything came out in the media.\"",

      "That will definitely help should the Manchester United captain be called upon in Switzerland, although she has already made history just from being there.",
      "Le Tissier is the first player from Guernsey – male or female – to be selected by England for a major tournament and it is back home where she began to develop into the player she is today.",
      "Island life",
      "It did not take Le Tissier long to get into football back home in Guernsey as she started playing aged just four for the boys’ team at St Martin AC, who are based on the south of the island.",
      "Her first coach was her father, Darren, who had played semi-professionally while serving in the Royal Air Force and she continued playing for the club until she was 16.",
      "However, there were no girls’ teams in Guernsey, with its location meaning Le Tissier would have to travel further than practically anyone else to find one.",
      "She told England football: “I started travelling over to England to play for girls teams around the age of 11 or 12.",
      "“I remember I went away with Guernsey and I wasn’t actually meant to be on the tour at U11s and we went to play the Southampton boys’ academy team. I remember one of their coaches was like ‘you need to come over here and see if you can get into a team’.",
      "“So, my mum and dad found Hampshire and I played for them for two years when I was about 11 until 13 and flew over twice a month. I would fly over on Thursdays and miss school to train and then play Saturdays.",
      "“I did that once or twice a month for two years, but I was still missing too many sessions and games so we had to stop. I was so gutted at the time.”",
      "Determined to help their daughter keep playing in England, Le Tissier’s parents, with the help of the FA, found the South West Regional Camp.",

      "Eventually, she attracted the attention of Brighton & Hove Albion, who she signed for as a 16-year-old in the summer of 2018 which meant she had to move away from Guernsey. She would now be on ‘the mainland’ full-time.",
      "Soaring seagull",
      "It wasn’t long before Le Tissier was thrown into action at Brighton, who were managed by former Lionesses boss Hope Powell.",

      "She was on the standby list for their 2023 Women’s World Cup squad, but the call to head Down Under never came and she watched from home as Wiegman’s side reached the final, ultimately losing to Spain.",
      "Given competition for her place has included Leah Williamson, Millie Bright and Alex Greenwood, Le Tissier has had to be patient for her chances and has eight caps at the time of writing.",
      "Her stock continued to rise at United, however, as she helped them win their first major trophy as Tottenham were beaten 4-0 in the 2024 Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "Following the departure of fellow Lioness Katie Zelem that summer, Le Tissier was handed the captain’s armband at the still tender age of 22.",
      "It’s an honour that’s hardly weighed her down, however, as she was a rock at the back and managed to contribute five goals as United finished third in the WSL and qualified for the Women’s Champions League last season.",
      "How fitting that she also became the youngest player to make 100 WSL appearances when she faced her former club, Brighton, last November.",

      "The connection to Guernsey remains, although it’s worth repeating that she is not related to the island’s most famous footballing export despite sharing a surname with ex-forward Matt Le Tissier.",
      "That’s not to say there’s no link to the Southampton legend, however, as the two families know each other through her dad playing football with him.",

      "“Now a couple of other Guernsey girls have been to the South West Regional Camps, which is really nice to see, and there has been another Guernsey girl in the Brighton U21s, so it's nice to see the path being used and hopefully it's one which helps the boys as well.",
      "“It's really good to be a role model for girls and boys back in the Channel Islands because they don’t get that many opportunities to show what they are about.",

      "The FA Cup winners might believe holding on to Guehi and losing him on a free transfer is the way to go, but we’re not so sure. Either way, Sporting CP defender Ousmane Diomande has been mooted as the England international’s replacement, which is very smart business, assuming they can pull it off.",

But now the Gunners are prioritising Viktor Gyokeres, who has been targeted by United as well. This means the Red Devils are considering the England striker, and even though he’s at an age (29) where big clubs might ignore his talent, their interest makes perfect sense.",

He and Bukayo Saka aren’t enough to pass the Gunners off as likeable for rival fans while Mikel Arteta is in charge.",
      "Crystal Palace losing their best player and captain in the same summer would be disastrous, but given its likelihood they will have a plan in place, and if a club is capable of adapting to such drastic changes it’s them. They’ll never find themselves in relegation trouble — especially with Oliver Glasner in charge — and have the eye for recruitment that will help fans sleep easily.",

      "Murillo was one of Nottingham Forest’s standouts in a fantastic 2024/25 season and is a clear upgrade on some of Chelsea’s centre-back signings in the Todd Boehly era. Two left-footed centre-backs might not be the most traditional pairing — and that’s what we’d see at Stamford Bridge, with Levi Colwill an undisputed starter for years to come — but they’d form one of the best partnerships in the Premier League, with a combined age of just 44.",

      "Eddie Howe needs a new right-winger, even after the incredibly productive season Jacob Murphy just had, which is still baffling. Kudus would be an upgrade and is only 25 years old.",
      "",
      "Morgan Rogers to Liverpool\nThis would be a fantastic move for Liverpool and Rogers, whose ability and potential deserve to be recognised at one of the best and biggest clubs in Europe. To quote Harry Redknapp: “He will go right to the very top.”",
      "He possesses the attributes modern managers love in an attacking midfielder. He has a lovely blend of strength and pace that makes him an elite ball-carrier with end-product.",
      "Capable of playing in the No.10 role and on either wing, Rogers would be an asset for any of last season’s top four and there’s no doubt he’d massively contribute towards a title push for any of those clubs.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White to Manchester City\nThere was talk not so long ago of City targeting Florian Wirtz or Gibbs-White as their Kevin De Bruyne replacement. They’ve since signed Rayan Cherki, Wirtz joined Liverpool in June, and Gibbs-White remains a Nottingham Forest player.",
      "Cherki’s arrival from Lyon, along with the signing of Dutch international Tijjani Reijnders, doesn’t mean City are done recruiting creative midfielders. When the initial interest in Wirtz and Gibbs-White was reported, it was said they could sign both. Now, they could well end up with neither — but Cherki is a shrewd addition for £34million.",
      "The England international would cost a fair whack, and even with Forest in Europe, you’d imagine he’d quite fancy to play under Pep Guardiola. Like Rogers, he’s capable of playing as a No.10, a little deeper, or on either wing. He’d be a superb signing.",
      "",
      "Yoane Wissa to Tottenham Hotspur\nIf you’re wondering, Bryan Mbeumo has been ignored because he’s pretty nailed on to go to Manchester United. Although Mbeumo being the player United finally decided to stand firm over and refuse to meet a club’s demands for would be very on brand. He’s actually worth the money, lads. Unlike Mason Mount with a year left on his Chelsea contract, and Antony — who they could’ve signed for half the price a month before paying £80m to Ajax.",
      "Anyway, we digress. New Spurs boss Thomas Frank looks set to miss out on Mbeumo, so could turn his attention to another former Brentford player. Wissa scored an outstanding 19 goals in the Premier League last season and is out of contract next year, so the Bees will be open to selling for the right price.",
      "With Dominic Solanke struggling with injuries, Wissa would be a very savvy addition.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "An ex-Aston Villa striker has labelled Ollie Watkins’ potential move to Man Utd as a step ‘backwards’, saying ‘Villa are playing in Europe, Utd aren’t.’",
      "Arsenal have allowed Takehiro Tomiyasu to leave the club after his deal at the Emirates Stadium was ‘terminated on mutual consent’.",
      "Arsenal are preparing a bid for Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze, with the England international open to a transfer after talks with the Gunners.",
      "Arsenal could ‘wrap up’ a deal for a ‘desperate’ star ‘in the next hour’ as Andrea Berta has been told how he can reduce the transfer fee.",

      "Let’s not beat around the bush: Fabrizio Romano is a character. Love him or hate him, we can’t live without him.",
      "This is a man who screenshot Lamine Yamal’s Instagram story after 18 seconds to post it on his X account. He’s a mouthpiece for agents and has an unprecedented amount of power for a transfer journalist. His word is gospel to so many people, and that fame and reliability make him a perfect tool for players and their representatives trying to engineer a move.",
      "If he posted on X ‘Young talent Jason Soutar is being watched by several top clubs after Dundee contract expiry’, I’d probably be a professional footballer within a week.",
      "He’s got his favourites, too — posting about the same players countless times. Jonathan David instantly comes to mind, and his transfer to Juventus has inspired us to look at some deals Romano has essentially manifested or helped materialise through sheer online presence.",
      "Jonathan David to Juventus\nFabrizio Romano can finally sleep after years of trying to get Jonathan David out of Lille. The Canadian striker got the ‘Here we go’ for a move to Juventus. No fee involved after his Lille contract expired.",
      "David had been perpetually linked with the Premier League, thanks in large part to the transfer guru, who’s been championing his client favourite player for years. He never got his England move but joins a proper European giant in Juve, back to doing what they do best: signing elite talent for free.",
      "MORE: Eight stars *definitely* in Fabrizio Romano’s contact book",
      "",
      "Milos Kerkez to Liverpool\nSticking with summer 2025 and sagas fresh in the mind, Romano was all over Kerkez as he sparkled for Bournemouth, linking him to Manchester United and Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool got their man after United opted for Patrick Dorgu in January. Let’s be honest, picking between the actual Premier League champions and the shambles that is Manchester United wasn’t a hard call.",
      "Romano introduced many of us to Kerkez back in April 2023, when Benfica were keen. It then looked like Lazio, until Bournemouth underlined the power of the Premier League by swooping in and hijacking the deal.",
      "After a brilliant debut season, Romano went into endorsement overdrive — reporting that United “will bring in a new left-back for sure this summer”. Are we allowing Noussair Mazraoui? If not, he was wrong…the FRAUD.",
      "Any goal involvement became an excuse for Romano to boost the Kerkez hype, and he ultimately earned his move to Liverpool. Absolutely deserved, for what it’s worth.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro to Chelsea\nYou might’ve forgotten this, but Romano once gave a ‘Here we go’ for Pedro joining Newcastle United from Watford. What. A FRAUD.",
      "Pedro went to Brighton instead. Newcastle wanted him again this summer. Now he’s at Chelsea.",
      "Romano loves a Brazilian (not that kind) — Joao Pedro, Vitor Roque, Casemiro, Andre, Raphinha. We stopped paying attention to what he was saying about Pedro long ago. He could’ve said ‘Here we go’ to a move to Bikini Bottom and we’d have just shrugged.",
      "",
      "Aurelien Tchouameni to Real Madrid\nBack in 2022, Tchouameni was hot property after bossing Ligue 1 for Monaco. But it was always Real Madrid — as Romano was very keen to tell us. Often.",
      "Romano says Klopp “called” Tchouameni. PSG “made the best proposal”. But nope, the “player only wanted Madrid”. Which we knew. Because he said it 147 times.",
      "Romano’s first post about the Frenchman even ruled out Man United a year early. ‘Manchester United are currently not working to sign Tchouameni… no contacts as of now,’ he tweeted. UTDTrey top of the replies: ‘Don’t know who he is anyway.’ United fans and their transfer team summed up perfectly.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool\nSurprisingly, Romano didn’t tweet about Frimpong until he was at Leverkusen. Nothing from the Celtic days. Shameful.",
      "Naturally, United were chucked into the mix as Frimpong shone, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich also sniffing around. Romano dropped an exclusive about a new contract, was one of the first to reveal his £34m release clause, and would occasionally repeat the same nothing update just to keep things warm. Classic Fabrizio. We do love you, you know?",
      "A day after saying Frimpong was “one to watch this summer”, Romano reported Liverpool’s interest as a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement. Liverpool being Liverpool, they signed him in four days flat.",
      "",
      "Casemiro to Manchester United\nUnited wanted De Jong. De Jong wanted anything but United. Enter Casemiro.",
      "Romano was on this the second it was viable. Updates came thick and fast as he and United pushed to get it over the line. United got their man. It looked clever for a year, which is decent for them.",
      "",
      "Raphinha to Barcelona\nWhat a saga. Romano wasn’t alone — Matt Law and David Ornstein were in there too — but Romano kept bringing it back to Barca, saying they were Raphinha’s “dream club” and that personal terms were already sorted.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds agreed a fee. Barca had no money. But Romano said they’d “try until the end”, and they did. And they won.",
      "He finally dropped the ‘Here we go’ saying Raphinha “only wanted Barca since February”. Brother, we know. You told us 176 times.",
      "",
      "Mykhaylo Mudryk to Chelsea\nThis saga — January 2023’s finest. The only reason to get up in the morning.",
      "Mudryk wanted Arsenal. Arsenal wanted Mudryk. But Arsenal also wanted to haggle. Chelsea said “money?” and Shakhtar said “yes, please”.",
      "Romano was at his most plugged-in here — borderline on Chelsea’s payroll. Either that, or Todd Boehly was just following Romano’s feed and bidding for whoever Arsenal fancied.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana to Inter\nWhile Onana was dealing with a doping ban, Romano told us he was Inter-bound in a year. Guess what? He was.",
      "Lyon fell through, Arsenal were curious, Inter waited. Romano was patient. Inter got their man. United eventually took the bait. Big mistake.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, an ‘agreement is almost done’ as Newcastle United are ‘closing in’ on their second summer signing.",
      "According to reports, there is a key caveat with Liverpool’s ‘buy-back clause’ with Jarell Quansah as he closes in on a move to Bayer Leverkusen.",

      "According to reports, Liverpool will not be breaking their wage structure when they sign Florian Wirtz, as Fabrizio Romano has revealed what he will earn.",

      "Rashford left Old Trafford in the January transfer window as Aston Villa took him on loan for the remainder of the season after a falling out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Man Utd forward was directly involved in ten goals in 17 matches at Villa Park in a successful loan spell that has once again boosted his reputation around Europe, to the delight of the Red Devils.",
      "It is clear that Rashford has to leave this summer unless there is an incredible U-turn from Amorim, who publicly stated in January that he’d rather play his goalkeeper coach than the Man Utd forward.",
      "When asked why Rashford wasn’t being selected, Amorim replied in a press conference: “It’s always the same reason: the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It’s every day, every detail.",
      "“If things don’t change, I will not change. It’s the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.",

      "“You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench. But I would put [Man Utd goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "Amorim did admit that he was “really happy” to see Rashford doing well on his loan spell, he commented in April: “All players on loan will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season. The talent of Rashford, Antony… we are really happy because if you put players on loan you want them to perform.”",
      "But the Daily Mail now claim that there has not been ‘any contact between Amorim and Rashford after the United boss dropped the England star over his alleged attitude in training’.",
      "After Aston Villa decided against taking up their £40m option to buy him, Rashford is now ‘expecting to play a full part in Manchester United’s pre-season programme when he reports to Carrington for training on Monday morning’.",
      "Sources close to Rashford have told the Daily Mail that ‘he has no issue returning to the club and will “give 100 per cent” in training’ despite his issues with Amorim.",

So while Arsenal might hope or expect to see a lovely central midfielder or even, bless, their hearts, an actual centre-forward arrive through the training ground doors, pure logic and playing the odds tells us it’s far more likely to be a goalkeeper.",
      "Even though Arsenal already have a very good goalkeeper and have already signed another goalkeeper this summer. That just shows how much they like signing goalkeepers. Even if you count Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus as centre-forwards, then Arteta has still signed twice as many goalkeepers as centre-forwards as Arsenal manager.",
      "Again, using nothing but the very purest and definitely non-mental of logic, that means they MUST sign one more goalkeeper this summer if they wish to procure one number nine. It’s very simple.",
      "Having established that Lille are Arsenal’s favourite club to buy from, how about this for a possible solution to a goalkeeper problem that doesn’t actually exist at the Emirates? Bring back Vito Mannone.",

      "But it is a very on-brand Manchester United signing for so many reasons. Buying a player from the manager’s former club? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker who’s never actually done the business in a top league before? Tick.",
      "The only possible question-mark here is whether, if this did end up happening, United would have ended up paying the full Man United Tax, or merely the more bog-standard Premier League and bidding war tax.",

If football transfers were a supermarket, Spurs would do 73% of their shopping in the middle of Lidl before spunking whatever cash they’ve got left on bullshit ‘picky bits’ from Waitrose.",
      "Lyon are already a club Spurs like to work with, presumably because back when Jean-Michel Aulas was in charge there was a healthy mutual respect between him and Daniel Levy as the transfer game’s two most notoriously difficult bastards. It genuinely is a wonder they ever managed to get a deal done, but we suspect every time they each walked away certain they’d pulled the other’s pants down.",
      "Aulas definitely won with Tanguy Ndombele and Clinton Njie, but we will have to give Hugo Lloris to Levy.",
      "But with Lyon now booted into Ligue 2 – obviously pending an appeal – there is presumably some kind of whoops aisle apocalypse in store. Everything must go, and Spurs cannot resist that orange sticker.",
      "No idea who they’ll end up with, of course, because to try and predict that would be an attempt to impose order on a club that exists in permanent chaos. Three slightly shop-soiled right-backs, probably. Can never have too many, can you? And those best before dates are a scam, actually, cooked up to make you throw stuff away and buy some more.",

      "Villa’s serendipitous and entirely coincidental sale of their women’s team to themselves for an eye-watering price has sorted out any PSR concerns this time, so that’s nice, even though actually of course that wasn’t actually in any way a motivating factor actually, and thus the spending can continue from a club that likes to buy itself expensive treats these days. Even if sometimes they can only borrow them for a bit.",
      "Villa are the social-media influencer trying to project an image of extreme wealth that doesn’t quite match the reality, in a way.",
      "But while missing out on another crack at the Champions League is a disappointment and financial impediment, they can surely still shop at the Everton store for at least one more summer.",
      "Villa are in need of a centre-back with their Other January Loan, Axel Disasi, heading back to Chelsea, so why not Jarrad Branthwaite from their favourite shopping spot? Well, several reasons. But ignore those.",
      "It’s an undoubted step up for a player who might just need it to get himself the attention that could drive greater international opportunities, one that gives him a chance to play alongside some pretty handy defenders and under a very decent manager, all without the greater risks of a move to a fully-fledged giant where the danger of being swallowed up and spat out are very real indeed.",
      "Villa’s foundations may be slightly shaky, but they do remain an ideal ‘next step’ kind of club for players of Branthwaite’s ilk. Big enough and successful enough to definitely not be a sideways step, but without the laser focus and goldfish bowl existence and instant rushes to judgement that come by jumping straight to even loftier ground.",
      "What’s in it for Everton is much less clear, but this isn’t about them. Even if we do give this one about a 0.1% chance of actually happening.",

      "Arsenal remain active in the transfer market with Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke the most prominent names linked in recent days.",
      "The departure of Carlos Cuesta, who left to take charge of Parma, has created space in Arteta’s coaching setup. That role is now expected to be filled by former Man Utd defender Gabriel Heinze.",
      "Heinze, 47, is set to return to the Premier League in a very different capacity, joining Arteta’s backroom ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The pair have known each other since their time as teammates at Paris Saint-Germain, and Arteta has made no secret of the influence Heinze had on him as a young player.",
      "Speaking in a past interview, the Arsenal manager named Heinze alongside Mauricio Pochettino as one of the senior players who “were guiding me in everything I had to do in my professional life… and they were inspirational to me.”",
      "Heinze’s playing career was as uncompromising as it was decorated. He made 72 appearances for Argentina, featured at two World Cups, and lifted domestic titles in England, France, Spain and Argentina.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Real Madrid ‘open to selling’ £77m Arsenal target with ‘suitable offer’ to seal transfer\n👉 Fabrizio Romano confirms ‘new round of talks’ with Chelsea star ‘open’ to Arsenal move\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Man Utd to move for Watkins, Arsenal given Rodrygo boost",
      "After joining Man Utd in 2004, he was voted the club’s Player of the Year in his debut season, becoming a cult hero among fans at Old Trafford.",
      "His time in Manchester ended less harmoniously, with Heinze pushing for a controversial move to Liverpool after falling down the pecking order under Sir Alex Ferguson. That move was blocked, and he left for Real Madrid instead.",
      "Since retiring, Heinze has held several head coaching roles in South America, including at Newell’s Old Boys, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield. He also had a short spell in MLS with Atlanta United but has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Heinze will now slot into an Arsenal setup that already includes Albert Stuivenberg, goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana and set-piece specialist Nicolas Jover — all of whom signed new contracts last season to align with Arteta’s own deal, which runs until 2027.",
      "With pre-season preparations now underway and Arsenal due to tour Singapore and Hong Kong later this month, Heinze’s arrival is expected to be made official in the coming days."

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal are keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "18) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. And Berta, evidently, hasn’t sufficiently seduced the striker’s agents. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca like Luis Diaz but Liverpool are either keen to keep the Colombian or they will only sell for money Barca don’t have. Which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "13) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo. But Rodrygo might be too pricey; Williams seems to be staying in Bilbao; and Eze could be signed separately. Romano reckons more talks have taken place, but seemingly not between the clubs.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London almost a fortnight ago to complete his move, but if we know anything about Arsenal this summer, it’s that they won’t be rushed."

      "Real Madrid’s Rodrygo, Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze, Atalanta’s Ademola Lookman and more have been mooted, while it looked for a while that Arsenal would make a serious play to sign Athletic Bilbao’s Williams.",
      "Even as recently as mid-June, there were reports claiming that Arsenal and Barcelona were the leading contenders to sign Williams and that the Gunners had ‘offered’ a salary worth around nine million euros, which is more than the Catalan giants were willing to pay.",
      "Bayern Munich and other clubs have also been linked with Williams but Athletic Bilbao announced on Friday that the Spain international had signed a new deal at Estadio de San Mames.",
      "Giving details of the deal, Romano revealed on X: ‘Nico Williams signs new long term deal at Athletic Club until June 2035! The agreement includes new release clause for +50% compared to €58m previous one and salary increase. Barcelona deal OFF due to registration issues.’",

The Australian goalkeeper didn’t see eye to eye with Fergie and, hours after his Manchester United deal was ripped up, he joined Chelsea.",

      "News that Arsenal and Tomiyasu would part ways came out of the blue. The Japanese international only played six minutes across the entire 2024/25 campaign after being unable to shake a knee problem. He’s still injured after undergoing surgery and not expected back for at least another five months.",
      "Given his injury woes and long, ongoing rehabilitation, combined with the fact his contract was set to expire next year (with a one-year option), both parties have decided to go their separate ways. It’s a real pity, because when fit, Tomiyasu was a proper asset — capable of playing right-back, left-back or centre-back, and comfortable with both feet. What a shame.",

He promptly landed on his feet with a short-term deal at Bayern Munich.",

      "Keane insisted he would have said it all to their faces. And you know what? He definitely would have.",

His refusal to take a voluntary 12.5% pay cut during the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t help, nor did his criticism of the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China — which Arsenal notably distanced themselves from. That’s a conversation for another day.",

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester United should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders.",
      "10) Heung-min Son (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThe South Korea and Spurs captain endured a difficult 2024/25 campaign but still ended up with 11 goals and 12 assists in 46 matches, including 17 goal involvements in 30 Premier League appearances. Those numbers mask what was a disappointing season overall, with it increasingly clear that Son is in sharp decline.",
      "That being said, it could simply have been an off year, and there’s a growing willingness at Spurs to part ways with one of their greatest-ever players. His respectable output last season, combined with elite numbers in years gone by, makes Son an intriguing potential target for clubs abroad.",
      "",
      "9) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon were prepared to sell Fofana amid interest from clubs like Liverpool and Bayern Munich, but their financially-influenced relegation to Ligue 2 means there’s now no chance the young Belgian sticks around.",
      "His sale could help Lyon retain their Ligue 1 status, but there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave. Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and are on the brink of selling Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, while Borussia Dortmund have confirmed Jamie Gittens’ move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, Fofana is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "7) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham)\nSpurs and Newcastle are in the frame for Kudus, who is available this summer as West Ham boss Graham Potter looks to rebuild the squad and correct the missteps of Julen Lopetegui’s 2024 summer recruitment.",
      "Kudus is coming off an underwhelming season following an impressive debut Premier League campaign in 2023/24, but he’s still attracting plenty of interest. That first season alone is enough for the Hammers to believe they can command a significant fee.",
      "Versatile and devastating on his day, Kudus could be a top-class signing for any Premier League side.",
      "",
      "6) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "5) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. Scott McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "His salary is the crucial stumbling block; only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal. We say should, but Brentford have other ideas.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs has potentially thrown a spanner in the works.",
      "Mbeumo is clearly an elite talent, capable of scoring goals from the right. It’s no wonder United have made two bids for him already. But Brentford are standing firm.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",
      "The tributes to Diogo Jota keep pouring in, while the Mailbox also includes a far less important take on Rodrygo not being an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window.",

      "Osimhen has ‘expressed his willingness to join the Red Devils’ new project led by Rubén Amorim, despite the fact that the English club will not be playing in the next edition of the Champions League’.",
      "The Napoli striker ‘fits’ the profile that Man Utd are looking for this summer and for Amorim ‘his arrival would be a luxury addition to revive the team’s attack’.",
      "But it ‘is not a done deal’ and the Red Devils ‘will have to adjust its accounts’ to fit Osimhen in as the player’s wage demands are very high.",
      "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is not convinced that Osimhen would thrive in the Premier League and remains unconvinced that the Nigerian would hit the ground running in England.",
      "When asked whether Chelsea should have signed Osimhen on John Obi Mikel’s podcast, Hasselbaink said: “I know he’s your countryman but I’m not convinced of Osimhen for the Premier League.",
      "“For Spain, for Italy – yes. For the Premier League? I’m not 100 per cent sure.”",
      "But former Arsenal and Chelsea defender William Gallas insists that Osimhen “has the right profile” to become a Premier League star.",
      "Gallas told Prime Casino: “I think Victor Osimhen can become a star in the Premier League, he has the right profile. He can stretch play and stretch the backlines. Another attacker can run into the space he makes, and he could be useful for any club in the Premier League. He’s always learning, but at the same time, how long will he need to adapt to a new situation?”",
      "Gallas added: “We’ve seen foreign players before, it’s often difficult for them in the first season. The second season they step up, so it’s not unusual at all. Even Ronaldo, in his first season he wasn’t the Ronaldo we know now, but in the second season there were signs.",
      "“It all depends which club. If Arsenal need results straight away, they need to win the Premier League next year, then they need one player who can do it straight away. They don’t have time.",
      "“If we talk about Manchester United, from where they are now, they don’t need to win the league. They’re looking to be top four or top five, so maybe they can give Osimhen the time he needs.”",
      "Liverpool have made their decision on which striker to pursue this summer amid claims they are still looking to sign Alexander Isak, according to reports.",

      "Of course, as always with Spurs, managerial changes got in the way. Signed by Harry Redknapp six months before he left the club, Downing never truly got over Andre Villas-Boas’ early suspicions, and that was that.",
      "Managing just three Premier League goals and a handful of assists, he – like so many others before him after being chewed up by Spurs’ ridiculousness – sought solace at West Ham, because they are very, very, very slightly less ridiculous.",

      "It must be hard to imagine for younger fans now, but there was a time when Manchester United losing a game of football to a team they shouldn’t really lose to was an event of national importance. There’s a reason ‘Hated, adored, never ignored’ came to be a United call to arms, and it’s far more powerful than the ‘Hated, adored, occasionally viewed with something approaching pity’ that would now apply.",
      "Anyway, Back in the mid-90s, Manchester United did two hilarities at The Dell. And they are two of the more infamous United hilarities of the time. They lost a game 6-3, which even now would be notably funny, and they also infamously lost a game where they changed their grey kit at half-time because it had apparently rendered the players invisible to each other yet not, weirdly, to the Southampton players. Worst. Invincibility. Cloak. Ever.",
      "But these two now frequently conflated events happened on two entirely separate occasions. United were in blue and white for the 6-3 paddling at the hands of a Southampton team managed by Graeme Souness, which itself feels like a candidate for this feature until you remember that he was the manager for that whole Ali Dia caper and then somehow it becomes something that could somehow belong in both this feature and its sibling about things that did happen but feel like they couldn’t possibly have and we’re not going to lie our brain really hurts.",

      "Nobody cared about that City title win, because it lacked anything approaching the AGUERROOOO moment and the story of that season was 100 per cent Liverpool’s unlikely title charge and inexplicable late collapse, via The Slip and Crystanbul.",
      "The fact The Slip came against Chelsea, who were at that time still very much a team who sometimes won the league, makes a perfect combination of a memorable disaster against a plausible title winner against a backdrop of entirely forgettable actual title winners.",

Poacher’s goals, instinctive finishes, goals scored with aplomb, defenders left trailing desperately in his wake. This the direct result of years and years and years refusing to grow or develop even the tiniest interest or curiosity about literally anything that wasn’t about scoring goals. Or to some extent racehorses.",
      "Sure, injuries caught up with him and as his hamstrings betrayed him the goals and glory dried up a little.",
      "But still he could look back on all those 20-goal seasons from his younger days with Liverpool. For Michael Owen, the rapid youngster with the insatiable appetite for goals, was the very epitome of the 20-goal striker.",
      "Except he never did. Despite scoring 175 league goals in his career at Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle and Manchester United he never once scored 20 league goals in a single season."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ at least two Juventus players ‘in exchange’ for Jadon Sancho.",
      "United are trying to offload Sancho after Chelsea paid a £5million penalty not to sign him permanently for £25m following his loan spell during the 2024/25 season.",
      "He has plenty of interest — mainly from abroad — but his £275,000-a-week wages are stalling transfer negotiations.",
      "Fenerbahce had been linked, but that move has been ruled out. Italian giants Juventus and Napoli, as well as Sancho’s former club Borussia Dortmund, are all in the frame.",
      "Sancho isn’t the only one available — United are also desperate to shift Marcus Rashford.",
      "The 27-year-old is being considered by Barcelona and Bayern Munich and is valued at £40m, but like Sancho, his £315,000-a-week wages are a colossal stumbling block.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?",
      "A report from the Daily Mail claims Rashford could leave on loan again after spending six months at Aston Villa, while Juventus’ efforts to sign Sancho include offering two players in a swap deal.",
      "Journalist Chris Wheeler reports that Rashford’s camp have been in ‘talks’ with La Liga champions Barcelona, while the Old Lady ‘are unlikely to cover even half’ of Sancho’s salary.",
      "To get around that issue, Juve ‘have offered several players in exchange, including Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic’.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is chasing a new centre-forward and could be tempted by Vlahovic in a swap for Sancho, who clearly has no future at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s also claimed that Dortmund are ‘considering’ Sancho as a replacement for Chelsea-bound winger Jamie Gittens.",
      "Another player who appears to be on his way out is Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "Garnacho is seen as United’s ‘best chance of a big transfer fee’ this summer, after Bruno Fernandes turned down Al Hilal.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s transfer team have set an ambitious £60m asking price for the Argentina winger. Napoli are described as ‘long-time admirers’, while ‘Chelsea are one of three Premier League clubs showing an interest after Spurs also enquired in January’.",
      "There are also updates on the futures of Antony and Tyrell Malacia:",
      "Antony rediscovered his form on loan at Real Betis and wants to join the Seville club permanently. However, it might be another loan with an obligation to buy and United want more than Betis are currently offering – believed to be around £30m – for a player who cost £86m from Ajax three years ago.",
      "Malacia is also back at United after PSV Eindhoven decided not to make his loan move permanent for £8.3m, but he is unlikely to figure in Amorim’s plans.",
      "All of these players are due back for pre-season training on Monday, but shifting them won’t be easy — especially after Amorim made it clear he wants Rashford and Garnacho to leave.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window.",

      "Man Utd are closing in on a crucial moment in their pursuit of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to a report, which outlines their next steps if a third bid is to be rejected.",
      "After a turbulent 2024/25 campaign, Man Utd are eager to strengthen their attacking options ahead of the new season under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mbeumo, the Cameroon international, has made it clear he wants to join Utd, but talks between the clubs have been slow and complex.",
      "Utd’s initial offer of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons was rejected, and a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in add-ons also failed to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "The west London club believe Mbeumo’s worth exceeds the amount the Red Devils recently paid for Matheus Cunha, intensifying the standoff. Cunha’s £62.5 million transfer clause was triggered in June, and the fee will be paid to Wolves over two years.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed that talks restarted recently, with Utd carefully reviewing how far they can push their offer. He said:",
      "“So constant contacts between the two clubs to reach an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo. There is still no here we go, but may United keep working on that, United keep advancing, United keep their confidence and their optimism to make the deal happen.”",
      "The club are thought to be aware that an overpayment could set a dangerous precedent in the transfer market, especially given criticism from owners INEOS and internal calls for more disciplined spending.",
      "For that reason, according to GiveMeSport, club officials are prepared to walk away from the deal entirely should their third bid fail to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "An internal deadline reportedly looms, aiming to have the deal concluded before the start of pre-season training. However, with no agreement yet in place, that timeline appears increasingly optimistic.",
      "Mbeumo’s Premier League statistics underline why United are so keen to sign him. The 25-year-old finished last season as Brentford’s top scorer with 20 goals in 38 appearances, leading the squad in key passes per game and match ratings.",
      "His ability to unlock defences with pace and precision has made him one of the league’s most dangerous forwards.",
      "Although there’s growing hope he could line up in a Brentford shirt next season, the club is preparing for the possibility that their star player will leave this summer. The financial realities facing the Bees, combined with Mbeumo’s desire to play on a bigger stage, suggest the transfer could be imminent.",
      "Man Utd are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the deal set to “speed up soon”, according to an insider.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to the Bees’ director of football as Man Utd ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over their £60m forward.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer."

      "But the former forward also pinpointed a key issue: Sancho’s reserved nature off the pitch, which may have given Erik ten Hag and his Utd team-mates the wrong impression.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates.",
      "He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.”",
      "McCarthy emphasized that the winger’s quiet personality shouldn’t overshadow his talent or work ethic.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.”",
      "But when it came to consistency, McCarthy explained where the cracks began to appear.",
      "“I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best every day. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.”",
      "Despite the difficulties, McCarthy reserved praise for Sancho’s moments of brilliance.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him; he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho’s time at Man Utd has been a rollercoaster. After a mixed loan spell at Chelsea, who reportedly paid to opt out of signing him permanently, he’s nailed on to leave Old Trafford this summer.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
