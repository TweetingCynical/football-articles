      "Manchester United fans have slammed the club for a \"fresh kick in the teeth\" after new 2025-26 ticket prices were revealed - with some costing as much as £97 on general admission.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come under fire from supporters for his decision-making at Old Trafford following a series of cost-cutting measures that has seen him slash concessions and raise prices, on top of scrapping free lunches for staff. He has also axed Sir Alex Ferguson from his ambassadorial role amid the club's perilous financial position.",
      "It has come during a disastrous season for United after sacking Erik ten Hag and replacing him with Ruben Amorim - though the Portuguese coach failed to arrest the team's slump and ended up finishing 15th.",
      "United also lost the Europa League final against Tottenham and will be without European football entirely in the 2025-26 campaign, another major blow to their financial position.",
      "Now the Manchester United Supporters Trust have spoken out to condemn United chiefs for their ticket hikes, which they say are \"against the interest of fans\".",
      "\"This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans,\" the statement read. \"When the Club said they were introducing this new model for Members tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",
      "\"Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they're making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the Club as a whole.\"",
      "Category C, meanwhile, is set to cost roughly £37-£60 - but that will only be present for two games, against Sunderland and Wolves. Category D is the cheapest ticket bracket at a range of £32-£52 and will only be used for cup games.",
      "United are still set to be active in the transfer window despite their limited transfer funds, having already snapped up Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, and are also hoping to sign £70m-rated Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "However, the club are hoping to offload expensive stars such as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho from their wage bill to continue saving as much money as possible and reinvest it into their team. Earlier this year, Ratcliffe revealed United would have gone bust by Christmas without their new cost-cutting regime.",
      "\"Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of 2025,\" he said in an interview with Gary Neville. \"Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club or do you want to spend it on the squad? Because if you spend it on the squad, you get better results.",
      "\"The losses are because the club's just been spending money needlessly. We've got a body language consultant. There's all sorts of stuff we're spending money on that we don't need to be.\"",

      "Former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand believes Victor Osimhen is waiting for the club to move to the front of the queue for his signing. The Nigeria international spent last season on loan at Galatasaray, with parent club Napoli thought to be ready to cash in this summer.",
      "Ferdinand's claims come amid suggestions fellow target Viktor Gyokeres would favour a move to a club in the Champions League. Gyokeres starred under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP, where he still plays his club football, but a reunion might not be entirely straightforward.",
      "Gyokeres was also high on Arsenal's shopping list, with the Gunners deciding between him and Benjamin Sesko. Now, according to reports in Germany, Mikel Arteta's side have reached an agreement with Sesko - though they are yet to meet RB Leipzig's valuation of the Slovenian.",
      "United have already bolstered their attacking ranks this summer with a £62.5million swoop for Wolves' Matheus Cunha. Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked, despite United - unlike fellow suitors Spurs - being unable to offer Champions League football.",
      "Osimhen, who scored 37 goals in 41 Galatasaray games last season, has also been of interest to Saudi club Al Hilal. The 26-year-old is believed to favour a move to a European club, though, and Ferdinand has made his position clear.",
      "\"No.9, they already know who I want,\" Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents when discussing United's options. \"The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen!",

      "Ferdinand suggested he'd be happy with Gyokeres at Old Trafford if Osimhen doesn't arrive. Juventus have also been linked with the Swede, who fired Sporting to the Primeira Liga title last season, but Arsenal are believed to have put an approach of their own on ice.",
      "Arsenal's pursuit of Sesko comes after Leipzig failed to qualify for the Champions League, leaving them prepared to cash in for the right price. That price is still north of £60m, though, and Arsenal aren't yet on the same page as the selling club.",
      "Sesko was heavily linked with Arsenal last summer, and his decision to sign a new contract in 2024 hasn't slowed down the London club's pursuit. If they miss out on the former Red Bull Salzburg man, though, they could yet return for another former target in Aston Villa and England star Ollie Watkins.",

      "Jadon Sancho might not secure his Manchester United escape anytime soon - despite 'agreeing' to a move to Napoli. The England winger appears to have little future at Old Trafford after falling out of favour at the club.",
      "The £80m man spent the second-half of the 2023/24 season back with former club Borussia Dortmund. Chelsea then moved for Sancho last season having agreed a season-long loan deal with United, with a £25m obligation to buy.",
      "But the Blues backed out of that agreement by paying a £5m penalty fee, sending Sancho back to United in the process. The winger is unlikely to return to contention under current boss Ruben Amorim, leading to him looking for a new club.",
      "It is suggested that the Italian giants are struggling to finance the €25m (£21.3m) asking price that the Red Devils have put on Sancho’s head, while they would also struggle to afford his £300k-per-week wage packet.",
      "That is a similar issue to the one blighting them in their attempts to sign Manchester City star Jack Grealish. The former Aston Villa star banks a similar amount to Sancho, with it being suggested that City might have to foot around half of the bill in order to facilitate Grealish’s exit.",
      "Either way, City boss Pep Guardiola has suggested that he still looks set to leave the club. He said: “It was a conversation between him and the club and they decide. Jack is an exceptional player, the only reason why he didn’t play last season is of course my decisions, and we decide that he has to play - and the club was honest, he was honest.",
      "“We decide the best is that he has a place that he can feel he can play and come back to be the player that he was in the year of the treble or all his career at Aston Villa; without him it would have been impossible or more difficult to achieve the treble.",
      "“The fact is the last two seasons he hasn’t played much minutes and he has to come back to play and get the butterflies back in his stomach that he can play every three days and show again the quality that he has.”",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho has a decision to make regarding his own future. He has just one year remaining on his United contract having last played for the club in the Premier League August 2023.",

      "Andre Onana could potentially miss up to seven matches for Manchester United next season, assuming manager Ruben Amorim continues to back the goalkeeper. The Cameroonian has had a career marred by errors at Old Trafford since his £47million transfer from Inter Milan in 2023.",
      "Despite several blunders last season against the likes of Lyon, Leicester and Brighton, he remained the club's first-choice keeper. However, his position is one that Amorim may look to strengthen this summer.",
      "Whether he keeps his place remains to be seen, but the 29-year-old is set for a potentially extended absence regardless due to Cameroon's participation in the Africa Cup of Nations later this year. The tournament has been moved forward from its usual slot.",
      "The games he risks missing include clashes with Aston Villa, Newcastle United, Wolves, Leeds United, Burnley and Manchester City, as well as an FA Cup third round match scheduled among the league fixtures.",
      "Onana will only miss the Manchester derby if Cameroon do go all the way. There's also a chance he could play against Villa on December 20, given that Cameroon's first group match against Gabon isn't until Christmas Eve, followed by games against Ivory Coast and Mozambique.",
      "That would mean he'd have to join his international team-mates late, mirroring the controversy from two years ago when he missed the opening match of the 2023 tournament due to a late arrival at the national camp.",
      "Onana played against Tottenham Hotspur just a day before their first group game against Guinea, drawing criticism from Togo legend Emmanuel Adebayor, who accused the goalkeeper of disrespecting his country.",
      "\"He did not respect Cameroon,\" said the former Arsenal and Spurs striker. \"I was a player like him, and even being the most important player in my selection, I never acted in this way.",
      "\"The fact that this situation is happening shows that there is a problem, perhaps even within the federation. He risks losing big, because he has alienated the Cameroonian supporters, as well as many African supporters and undoubtedly certain members of the team.\"",
      "Altay Bayindir could be in line for a run in the first team if Amorim decides his goalkeeping situation is satisfactory, with the Turkish keeper having played 10 games across all competitions last season. According to the Athletic, Onana is set to stay at Old Trafford, although that doesn't guarantee he'll still be No. 1.",

The tournament in the United States would, he said, result in City and Chelsea being at a ‘huge’ disadvantage in the 2025-26 Premier League campaign.",
      "And the England manager is not the only one to think along those lines. Several times, Enzo Maresca and Pep Guardiola have voiced their major concerns over the physical and mental demands being made on their players.",
      "It might only be the slightest of consolations but perhaps the Premier League fixture schedulers have shown some sympathy for Guardiola and Maresca. Working on the basis that the three promoted teams are ranked 18th, 19th and 20th, the average finishing position from last season of City’s first six opponents next season is 13th (12.8, to be precise).",
      "That figure is 12th (11.67) for Chelsea. Just as significantly, Chelsea do not have to leave London until over a month into the campaign, a home starter against Crystal Palace being followed by a trip to West Ham before a derby with Fulham at Stamford Bridge is followed by a short hop to Brentford.",
      "Of the first six teams faced by both City and Chelsea, only two finished in last season’s Premier League top ten. Arsenal and Manchester United, on the other hand, each have four fixtures against top-ten teams in their opening six matches.",
      "And the average finishing position of their first six opponents last season was eighth (8.17). That represents a decidedly more challenging start for Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta - who go up against each other at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season - than the one faced by Guardiola and Maresca.",
      "In fact, in the context of last season’s form, no team has a harder opening six-game spell than the one in front of United and Arsenal. Normally, this type of imbalance produces two predictable responses.",
      "Firstly, what’s the problem? Everyone has to play everyone twice. The simple answer is that a good start can build momentum while a bad start can undermine confidence. A bad start can cost a manager his job, don’t forget.",
      "A second retort usually involves the old cliche about the Premier League is a competition in which everyone can beat everyone and that there are no easy games in the Premier League. And there is simply no truth in those assertions.",
      "Between them, Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton managed to record only 12 victories from their combined 114 Premier League games last season. Four of those 12 wins came in games against each other.",
      "They had a combined goal difference of minus 153. There ARE easy matches in the Premier League and they normally come against teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "That is why Nottingham Forest fans and manager Nuno Espírito Santo will be satisfied with their schedule as they face two promoted teams in their opening six fixtures. Forest’s start looks as relatively inviting as City’s and Chelsea’s but Maresca and Guardiola will, understandably, remind everyone of their summer workload if it is suggested they have some sort of advantage.",

And it emerged last week that Gyokeres' preference is a move to the Emirates, rather than Old Trafford.",

      "Arsenal's play for Sesko follows reports in Portugal that Real Madrid were offered the former Coventry City man's services. But Los Blancos are in the market for back-up striker, rather than someone who would command a significant first-team role like Gyokeres, and will not be signing him.",
      "It remains to be seen if Gyokeres would reconsider - or be more inclined to negotiate - a move to Manchester United, who have turned their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike, but are monitoring the possibility of a reunion for Gyokeres and head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils are unable to offer European football, which is thought to be one of the reasons Gyokeres initially favoured a move to Arsenal. But he may eventually end up with little choice, with a number of Gyokeres' supposed preferred options this summer - Liverpool, PSG, Manchester City and Barcelona among them - just not in the market for the Swedish hitman.",

      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is said to be prioritising a move to Arsenal or Juventus this summer The Swede would even prefer to join Manchester City or Liverpool, as opposed to long-time admirers Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres has fired his way to becoming one of European football's elite marksmen, bagging 97 goals in just 102 games for Portuguese outfit Sporting CP, whom he has helped to a pair of league titles.",
      "When head coach Ruben Amorim departed Sporting to take up the reins at Old Trafford in November, the prospect of Gyokeres following suit was mooted, given the Red Devils' faltering forward line. Although United have persued the 27-year-old with robustness this summer, reports earlier this month detailed that Gyokeres had turned his nose up at a Manchester reunion.",
      "Now, Portuguese outlet A Bola say that Gyokeres has become frustrated with a lack of transfer movement, but has set out which clubs he would like to join this window. They are Mikel Arteta's Gunners and Juventus, who have supposedly tabled a mammoth £11-million-a-year wage offer.",
      "According to the report, five clubs have expressed an interest in signing Gyokeres, with the Swedish striker currently enjoying a well-earned holiday.",
      "In England, both United and Arsenal have long been documented to hold the goalscorer in high regard, and Atletico Madrid, Juve and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other noted suitors.",
      "However, Gyokeres has supposedly prioritised moving to either the Emirates or Turin, and to rub further salt into the Red Devils' wounds, it is claimed he would also welcome any approach made by rivals City and Liverpool.",
      "It is said that the £70million-rated Swedish star would also prefer moves to the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG or Bayern Munich, and he remains 'upset' that he has not yet been allowed to make a switch.",
      "While Gyokeres has seemingly made it crystal clear that a move to north London would be his ideal Premier League transfer, the Gunners also have their eye on another striker.",
      "Reports from German outlet BILD suggest that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is close to joining Arsenal this window, and personal terms have been agreed between both parties. With the Bundesliga club failing to qualify for European football this term, a fee in the region of £70m-£85m could seal the deal.",
      "Gyokeres may then turn his attention to his other priority, Juventus, who Corriere dello Sport reports have offered him a lucrative £11m per year to leave for Serie A.",
      "With it seeming increasingly likely that Gyokeres will not join United, Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has emerged as another name who could be brought in to bolster United's firepower.",
      "As first reported by The Times, Amorim's side are interested in making a move for the Frenchman, and a £60m price tag has been slapped on the star who scored 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "\"I'm glad we have him [Ekitike]. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go,\" admitted Frankfurt chief Markus Kroshce ahead of what promises to be an incident-packed transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "A supercomputer has tipped Liverpool to retain their Premier League title ahead of Manchester City and Arsenal after the fixtures for the new season were released. The schedules for all 20 top-flight clubs were announced on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Reds stormed to their first title since 2020 last season in what was boss Arne Slot's first campaign as manager after replacing Jurgen Klopp. Arsenal finished as the runners-up for the third successive year, while City's hopes of defending their crown for a fifth successive year ended in tatters.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the surprise package of the year, securing qualification to the Europa Conference League. Down at the other end of the table, relegated Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have been replaced by Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Anticipation for the new season will only be growing as the summer goes on, with the summer transfer window in full swing. Liverpool have been working hard to give Slot the best chance of leading a successful title defence.",
      "They have already signed Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez on their way into Anfield. And it appears that those moves may well pay off for the Reds.",
      "According to a supercomputer from BettingLounge.co.uk, Liverpool will finish top of the league for a second successive year. The supercomputer is a probability model, not determined by human predictions or bias.",
      "It instead estimates the outcome of each remaining fixture based on a team’s current strength (based on factors such as league position and form) and betting market odds. The machine then simulates the remaining games in a season 10,000 times and constructs an average league table from the 10,000 simulations, to rule out anomalous results.",
      "Slot's side have been backed to lose just four games and win 24 matches to claim the title. Their closest challengers are tipped to be City, who are predicted to finish three points behind the Reds.",
      "Arsenal are expected to drop down to third, with the supercomputer tipped them to end up a mammoth 10 points adrift of the champions. Having missed out on the Champions League last season, Aston Villa are predicted to return to Europe's premier competition by finishing fourth.",
      "Newcastle are tipped to round out the top five as they continue to impress under Eddie Howe. Those two will be on the rise at Chelsea's expense, with the Blues set to drop to sixth under Enzo Maresca.",
      "While they have lost boss Thomas Frank, Brentford will not feel his absence, with the Bees tipped to end up seventh. Brighton and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace will take up the two places just behind the Londoners.",
      "And Bournemouth are predicted to round out the top half, despite losing a raft of players in this summer's window. With European football to deal with, Nottingham Forest are set to suffer and drop down to 11th in the table.",

The fixtures for the 2025-26 Premier League season were revealed on Wednesday - and there are some tricky schedules for some of the division's big hitters.",
      "Newly-promoted Leeds United represent Arsenal’s first home opponents of the season. Arsenal then face what is arguably their most difficult fixture the following weekend as they travel to Anfield to take on reigning champions Liverpool.",
      "Their run does not get any easier as they welcome Nottingham Forest to North London in mid-September - the Midlands side having challenged for a Champions League place last season.",
      "Arsenal then face their former title rivals Manchester City at the Emirates before a trip to St James’ Park to take on Newcastle United. Arteta will certainly be hoping that his side can come out of those six fixtures unscathed as he attempts to finally end the club’s long wait for the title.",
      "But it’s actually United who statistically have the hardest run, according to Opta. They host the Gunners on the opening day before clashes with Fulham and Burnley.",
      "A trip to rivals Manchester City follows ahead of a showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Opta have given United's run a difficulty rating of 94.6, while Arsenal’s opening fixtures sit marginally lower at exactly 94.",
      "But some Arsenal fans aren’t too convinced, with some even claiming that a title challenge could be over before it’s even begun. One fan said: “Starting the season with Man U, Leeds, Liverpool, Forest and City is really crazy..”",
      "Another responded: “Someone at the Premier League wanted to see Arsenal cooked from the jump! This is such a tough start. Well, if you want to be champions… Mountains must be climbed, no matter how soon you face them.”",
      "A final fan added: “Such a testing start for Arsenal. Manchester United (a), Leeds (h), Liverpool (a), Forest (h), Manchester City (h), Newcastle (a), West Ham (h). If Mikel Arteta’s side can start well then it’s game on. If not they could be out of the title mix come October’s international break…”",
      "Meanwhile, some fans have issued a demand to Arsenal boss Arteta to get a move on in the transfer market given the Gunners’ tough start. One supporter said: “Mad start to the season for Arsenal, makes it even more important to get deals done ASAP.”",
      "A further fan replied: “I beg of you for only one thing please have every single of transfer business done before the start of this new season, that schedule is looking insane new striker leading the line please sesko or gyorokes get it done maybe even both now seeing that run in.”",
      "A final fan added: “That’s a serious start. Arsenal better buck up their ideas in this transfer window and act fast, man.”",

      "The fixture list for the 2025-26 Premier League season has officially been released, and every club vying for top-flight supremacy has found out their potential paths to glory. Liverpool enter the new campaign as reigning champions, after Arne Slot delivered them the crown in his debut term.",
      "Arsenal, who have played second fiddle for the past three seasons, will be hoping to go one better this campaign, and have an early chance to prove their worth when they head to Old Trafford on the opening weekend before a trip to Anfield in late August. They'll host rivals Tottenham in November, with the reverse North London Derby taking place in early February.",
      "Manchester City will have enforcer Rodri back in action for the new season, and take on Wolves during the league's opening weekend, with a Manchester Derby to look forward to in September, as well as a battle with the Gunners one week later.",
      "As was the case last year, the new campaign will officially get up and running on a Friday evening in August, when Liverpool host Bournemouth at Anfield as the reigning Premier League champions on August 15.",
      "This also remains in line with the Premier League's return to a later start date after several years of slightly earlier restarts. Next term will begin a full 11 days after the 2022-23 campaign got underway, though that was motivated by the Qatar World Cup interrupting the schedule midway through the calendar.",
      "It also means teams will have to play less football before the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Many have urged organisers to shut the transfer window before the season gets underway at all, though this timing still leaves clubs with a fortnight to do business after the campaign starts.",
      "The Premier League will continue to adhere to a more manageable workload for players in 2025/26. After being pressured to fall in line with the scheduling policies of countries like Germany and Spain, England's elite will also have more respite over the Christmas and New Year period.",
      "This means no two rounds will take place within 60 hours of each other, a decision made to ease the burden on players during a congested part of the calendar. It also means that for the second season in a row, there will be no fixtures played on Christmas Eve.",
      "Anticipation will also be high around this time of year as the winter transfer window returns. The opening for clubs to conclude mid-season business will open on January 1, 2026 and close on February 2.",
      "Between August and May, the Premier League will host matchdays across 33 weekends and five midweek rounds. It's also now guaranteed that players will have 83 clear rest days over the course of those nine months, where no games are played.",
      "The campaign will conclude with 10 simultaneous kick-offs on Sunday, May 24. This has been scheduled to leave enough time ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which gets underway on June 11."

      "Manchester City's Rayan Cherki thinks highly of Chelsea target and former Lyon team-mate Malick Fofana. The Blues have been linked with a host of wingers this window, including Manchester United's wantaway Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side are on the hunt for a wide player this summer, after Jadon Sancho returned to Old Trafford upon the expiration of his loan, with no permanent deal sealed. In January, rumours swirled that Red Devils star Garnacho could be on his way to west London, and while his agents were even spotted at Stamford Bridge amid alleged talks, the 20-year-old stayed put.",
      "With the transfer window back open, hints have been dropped that Garnacho will seek pastures new, with his personal photographer even suggesting via social media that he has played for United for the 'last time.'",
      "However, a move to Chelsea could rely on the Blues not pursuing other targets, and Lyon's Fofana is now reportedly on their radar and has been given a glowing review by former team-mate and new City signing Cherki.",
      "Fofana arrived in Ligue 1 from Gent last year. At just 20, he recorded 11 goals and six assists this campaign, proving particularly prolific in the Europa League, in which he found the back of the net six times.",
      "The Belgian talent has attracted attention from not just the Blues, but Liverpool, United and Nottingham Forest, according to L'Equipe, though the City Ground is supposedly not his desired destination. He is valued at £42.5million.",
      "In 2024, when Fofana was being fleetingly integrated into Lyon's first team, Cherki, who completed a £30m transfer to the Etihad this summer, spoke highly of his peer.",
      "\"Malick Fofana? I like everything about him,\" admitted Cherki. \"He's good, kind, not very handsome (laughs), but who cares. He brings us his explosiveness.",
      "\"We tell him to go into spaces because we can give him the ball and he can hurt [opponents]. He has integrated well and is not afraid of much.\"",
      "Fofana has caught the eye of those around him plenty of times in the past. When he was starring for Gent in his native Belgium, the club's under-21 coach, Emilio Ferrera, described him as the best talent he'd ever seen.",
      "\"When I started as a coach of the youth team at Gent, I quickly knew that Malick was the greatest talent I ever trained,\" Ferrera admitted. \"He can explode a match on his own.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, Chelsea have made initial contact with Lyon over signing Fofana, and plenty of names on their wishlist could also be pursued with vigour this summer, Garnacho perhaps included.",
      "Borussia Dortmund wide player Jamie Gittens was subject to a rejected £42m offer earlier this month, with the German club seeking £50m for his services.",
      "Chelsea hoped to sign the English winger before Maresca's side jetted off for the Club World Cup, and while no deal was completed, a revised approach is not out of the question.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "An astonishing attack from Sir Alex Ferguson about Manchester United's fixture list prompted the Premier League to release their own statement in 2009. The official list of matches and their dates for the 2025/26 campaign will be released on Wednesday at 9am.",
      "The huge schedule details the rough plan of the 380 games that will be played between the 20 clubs in the top flight of English football. Premier League officials state the list is always randomised and put together by an outside IT company called Atos.",
      "However, after being left unhappy by a run of matches at the start of 2009, Ferguson tore into the Premier League's fixture list and insinuated that they tried to make life difficult for the Red Devils. In the 2008/09 campaign, United had to face nine of the 10 teams who finished directly below them the previous season away in the first half of the campaign.",
      "He was also aggrieved that his team had to play on the road straight after United's three Champions League away clashes at the time. In a pre-match press conference previewing an FA Cup third-round tie away to Southampton, the Scot tore into the Premier League.",
      "He said: \"I’ve been saying this for a few months, but our fixture programme didn’t do us any favours. I think we have been handicapped by the Premier League. They tell me it’s not planned - bloody hell!”",
      "When asked if he felt the Premier League wanted to disadvantage United, he added: \"I’ve got my doubts. I’m not saying what they do down there.",
      "\"But next year we’ll be sending somebody to see how it happens, I can assure you. I just don’t understand how you can get the fixtures like that.”",
      "The previous summer, United did have the opportunity to raise objections to the Premier League about the fixture list but chose not to. Officials from the division refuted Ferguson's comments with a strong statement.",
      "\"The police also approve it before it is sent to the clubs, at which point they can raise any objections they may have. There are various factors that go into the structuring of the fixture list - police requests, club requests, involvement in European or FIFA competitions for example - but the overriding factor is the luck of the draw.”",
      "Despite the tricky fixture scheduling, United were able to win the Premier League, pipping Liverpool to the title by four points. Throughout that era, Ferguson was far from the only person who was sceptical about the scheduling.",
      "At the start of the 2005/06 campaign, Jose Mourinho, who was beginning his second season at Chelsea at the time, told the People newspaper: \"It is always Chelsea who get the worst games, the worst fixtures to play, while Arsenal always have the best ones.\"",
      "His comments were said after the reveal of the fixture list, which had Chelsea down to play away from home immediately after their first five Champions League games, while the Gunners had home matches after their European clashes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Liverpool head into the campaign as defending champions, having stormed to the title in their first year under Arne Slot and will kick-off the season against Bournemouth at Anfield. The Reds are not resting on their laurels and have launched a major recruitment drive, with Jeremie Frimpong already having arrived, while Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez are set to follow.",
      "Mikel Arteta's Arsenal finished as runners-up for a third successive year last term and the Spaniard knows it's title or bust this season - they begin with a heavyweight clash against Manchester United. Manchester City will be looking to get back on top, while the Red Devils, after last season's debacle, will be hoping to climb the table, likewise Tottenham.",

      "One game that immediately stands out is Manchester United's home game with Liverpool on 2 May.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is steadily progressing. Boss Ruben Amorim is looking to enact a major overhaul at Old Trafford following a miserable season that left them 15th in the Premier League.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a deal worth around £63million. Further investment is needed though if Amorim is to turn around his reign after a dismal time in charge so far.",
      "High up his list is a new striker, but top target Liam Delap has snubbed a move to Old Trafford to instead join Chelsea. And the Red Devils have received a fresh setback with another target making it clear he will not be joining Amorim's squad.",
      "That comes as United chief executive Omar Berrada insisted that he has full confidence in the club's plans for the summer window. Berrada believes that Amorim has a clear vision that will be a success.",
      "Tom Heaton is set to sign a new one-year contract with Manchester United to remain as their third-choice keeper. Heaton has spent the last four years with the Red Devils in what is his second spell at Old Trafford.",
      "Before that, the 39-year-old had successful spells at Bristol City, Burnley and Aston Villa, earning regular call-ups to the England national team. He had been set to be out of contract this summer.",
      "But Heaton is now close to putting pen to paper on a new deal which will keep him at Old Trafford until next summer. The decision has been approved by Amorim and his coaching staff.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed the club will be busy for the rest of the summer window. Berrada has overseen a massive cost-cutting process over the past year.",
      "Despite that, he has told The United Stand that the Red Devils will be 'active' over the summer. He also backed the 'vision' Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox share for the direction of the club.",
      "“We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting,” Berrada added. “I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.”",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kauã Santos has insisted he will snub a move to Manchester United. Santos featured in 14 games this season before suffering a major injury and has a contract running for another five years, though United have grown interested in him.",
      "“The people in charge in Frankfurt have shown enormous trust in me. They wanted to continue working with me before these rumours even surfaced. They still have a lot of faith in me here, so it was clear to me that I wanted to extend my contract,\" he told Die Welt.",
      "\"I want to establish myself as a goalkeeper, perform well, and achieve as much as possible. I’m not busy with anything else at the moment, because my entire focus is on Eintracht Frankfurt.”"

      "Manchester United's new match categorisation ticket model has been branded a \"kick in the teeth\" by supporters.",
      "United will list six Premier League home fixtures as category A games, with prices between £59 and £97. The six teams are Liverpool, Manchester City, Leeds, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "Eleven league fixtures have been tagged category B, priced between £57 and £86, two are in the C band (£37-£60) while domestic cup fixtures are the D category (£32-£52). Junior and senior concessions remain in place and the categorisation only applies to match-by-match ticket members and not season ticket holders.",
      "United sources say the new structure reflects the reality of large variations in demand and attractiveness between different fixtures and that they have prioritised their most loyal fans in season-ticket holders and under-16 matchgoers.",
      "The Manchester United Supporters' Trust claims the fans' forum and the fans' advisory board (FAB) were not properly consulted on the new structure and that the price of the cheapest ticket for most league games has risen by more than 50 per cent. United sources say the figures were presented to the FAB, who requested a review.",
      "The new measure comes after United supporters fumed at least season's mid-season ticket-price hike to £66. Several supporters also demonstrated against the club's decision to relocate their season tickets in favour of a new hospitality section in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand at Old Trafford.",
      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, who had last lifted silverware in 2008.",
      "A source said the categorisation introduction has kept season-ticket prices lower than what United had initially proposed.",
      "MUST said in a statement: “After how last season went, we might have hoped the club would reconsider their plans for this new ticketing model which will see eye-watering price increases for 20,000 supporters per game who buy tickets on a match-by-match basis. This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans.",
      "\"When the club said they were introducing this new model for members' tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",
      "\"Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they’re making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the club as a whole.",
      "“The club's stated commitment to fan representation is fine in principle, but once again is not being delivered in practice. The structure is in place, and the fans' forum and FAB representatives are doing their job, but the club are not adhering to their previous commitment to proper consultation and that needs to change and change fast.",
      "“What Manchester United needs next season is a united fanbase and club, with the team on the pitch supported by loyal and vocal fans roaring it back after the disaster that was last year.",
      "\"These ticketing decisions only push those regular supporters away in favour of occasional visitors and risk pricing out the next generation of younger fans who are the very future of the club.",
      "\"This match categorisation model will do enormous harm and undermine the atmosphere in the ground in a season when the team will need it more than ever.”"

Under Cox's guidance, United won the FA Youth Cup in 2022, recruited Alejandro Garnacho from Atletico Madrid and Kobbie Mainoo emerged into the first team. Ethan Wheatley became United's 250th academy graduate when he came on against Sheffield United in April 2024.",

Following Brian McClair's departure as academy head, it was jointly run by John Murtough and former club secretary John Alexander in 2015.",

      "Williams will cost around £51m, while Rashford would reportedly be available for a fee in the region of £40m this summer, having agreed a similar option with Aston Villa during his recent loan spell.",
      "However, the LaLiga winners are still unable to register players due to their financial position, adding another dynamic to negotiations this summer.",
      "Turkish media outlet Sabah claims Manchester United have approached Goztepe to offer the Turkish club goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "The Turkish international has struggled since his arrival at Old Trafford from Fenerbahce during the 2023 summer window.",
      "The report claims United have approached Sport Republic, the group that owns the Turkish outfit to offer Bayindir's services. Interestingly, the group also owns Southampton, which saw Polish goalkeeper Mateuzs Lis make the move to the Super Lig last summer.",
      "The Polish goalkeeper has struggled since that move and the report claims United have offered Bayindir's services. However, it also adds that they aren't the only Turkish club to have been approached and that a deal may be difficult claiming the United shot stopper doesn't want to return to the Super Lig.",
      "Sport Bild claims Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Arsenal are the main players in the race to sign Xavi Simons this summer.",

      "However, Simons has a reported €70m (£59.8m) asking price. That being said, the report claims the player's brother Faustino has been in talks with the Premier League clubs, along with Barcelona.",
      "Given how much United could spend on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, another big-money signing looks unrealistic.",
      "BILD have reported that Arsenal have 'reached an agreement' with RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old has been the Gunners' top target this summer on the back of scoring 21 goals last season.",
      "The report in Germany claims that the Gunners have come to an agreement with the Slovenian on personal terms. There is still work to be done with Leipzig but it's suggested that the north Londoners have signalled they will make an offer that won't be below their £85.5m valuation.",
      "GiveMeSport claims Manchester United will rival Nottingham Forest for the signing of 25-year-old Palmeiras midfielder Richard Rios",

      "\"This operation is feasible, but we need to see how tough Manchester United can be holding out here, because Sancho is a good player and did pretty well at Chelsea. Cristiano Giuntoli wanted to bring him to Juventus last year, but then it didn’t go through.\"",

If Napoli were to sign the England youth international, then it would likely rule out a move for United star Alejandro Garnacho after January interest from Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Manchester United were one of the more active Premier League clubs during the first part of the summer transfer window and will be looking to ramp up their business and strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad ahead of next season.",

      "First shunned by Ruben Amorim last December, the 27-year-old did not play for United again before managing to secure a short-term loan to Aston Villa. There he was able to make an impact with four goals and six assists in 17 matches, thus reinforcing the message that perhaps his future lies anywhere besides this new dawn at Old Trafford.",
      "Villa had a £40m option to make their loan permanent but did not act on it, meaning it will fall on United to find a different club to sell to if this summer is going to produce the definitive parting of ways.",
      "Sporting director Deco has even told Catalan radio station RAC1 last month: \"We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players.\"",
      "It just so turns out as that situation has developed, it is one of those 'other players' that the La Liga side may progress towards signing instead of the United forward. Athletic Bilbao prospect and Spanish international Nico Williams appears to have emerged as their new top target, personally vying for the move.",
      "In a new update from Marca, Rashford is apparently not going to give up on his dream move to Barca whilst there is still a fighting chance.",
      "They say he is eager to become Barca player at the end of this saga and claim he is willing to supplement the fact that his price tag would likely be smaller than Williams' by making 'sacrifices', including those financially.",
      "That appears to a be a hint towards the England attacker slashing his wage demands in order to appear a more attractive option over the Bilbao and Liverpool options.",
      "Rashford, 27, earns £325,000-a-week at United and his salary has so far prevented him from leaving the club having previously outlined his desire for a \"new challenge\".",
      "As the saga over his future goes on, Rashford has already shown his commitment to being in the best possible shape ahead of the 2025/26 season, even if it is uncertain which club he will be playing for.",
      "He shared his training regime to his Instagram followers, showing that between Monday, June 9 and this coming Sunday, June 22, he will have had only three days off where he has not worked out in some capacity. Nine days were dedicated to gym sessions and on the pitch while two further days will be focused solely in the gym.",
      "Rashford then shared a video of himself completing a rope climb in warm weather, with Marca's report suggesting he has been holidaying in Marbella."

      "United will face West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton in the US, with their tour opener against the Hammers on July 27. Either side of the tour, the Reds will face Leeds United in Norway and Italian side Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "In an ideal world, United would love to have the bulk of their business wrapped up before crossing the Atlantic. In reality, that is unlikely to be the case.",
      "Last summer, for example, United completed three of their five summer signings after the tour. Only Leny Yoro went to the US after Joshua Zirkzee was granted a period of leave after representing the Netherlands at the European Championship in Germany earlier in the summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha is United's only new addition so far this summer after recently arriving from Wolves for £62.5million, but the club is hopeful of adding Bryan Mbeumo to the dressing room sooner rather than later.",
      "The Brentford star, despite also attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur, has told confidants that his preferred destination is Old Trafford. United saw an opening offer of £45million plus £10m in add-ons turned down earlier this month, but talks between the two clubs remain open.",
      "United would like to sign the Cameroonian, who scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, by the time pre-season starts in early-July, meaning United are in a battle against the clock to get him through the door.",
      "Signing Mbeumo would add another piece to United's jigsaw. They have made strengthening their attack a leading priority this summer and they would be two thirds of the way towards completing that objective if they were to sign the Brentford ace.",
      "However, the biggest challenge United face this summer is recruiting a No.9. They are in desperate need of a goalscorer and failing to sign one isn't an option.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, United's search for a striker could head in a number of different directions. They are being linked with a plethora of names, such as Viktor Gyokeres, Hugo Ekitike and Victor Osimhen.",
      "However, landing the statement striker they are in such desperate need of is not going to be an easy or straightforward task.",
      "United are also dependent on player sales to raise cash to fund new additions. If they sign Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m, they will then be reliant on departures to strengthen other areas of the squad.",
      "There is an obvious need for a midfielder and a goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana, but recruiting an established No.9 has to take priority. United scored just 44 league goals last season and have finished the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "Having been without Zirkzee, despite him turning out not to be a No.9, on last summer's tour, and Rasmus Hojlund arriving after the tour the previous year, United can ill-afford to go another pre-season campaign without a recognised No.9 in their ranks.",
      "Amorim would love to be able to take his new starting striker to the US with him and give him the opportunity to get used to his new teammates, learn the system and attempt to settle himself in before the competitive action starts against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "But for that ambition to become a reality, United are going to have to identify their top target to spearhead their attack and step up their efforts in the market to fund his arrival. Neither are impossible tasks, but the countdown is most definitely on."

      "Gomes became the fourth-youngest United player at the age of 16 years and 263 days against Crystal Palace in May 2017. He has made one start in the last seven months and his representatives failed with a desperate attempt to secure a loan move to a Premier League club on deadline day in January 2020."

      "Manchester United have been one of the most active clubs in the summer transfer window despite signing just one player. Matheus Cunha has already committed to Ruben Amorim's project after United triggered his £62.5million release clause.",
      "The overhaul of the squad has been in works since United lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final. At least three more players could be brought to Old Trafford with their business reliant on player sales.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is understood to be the priority at the moment with United in pole position to sign the Brentford star. After scoring a sensational 20 Premier League goals last term, the Cameroon international has been the subject of an £55million bid from United, which was rejected.",
      "A fee in the region of £60m is said to be enough to get the deal over the line. In spite of this, frustrations have increased over the hold-up of the deal. However, there could be a reason for this.",
      "Players are entitled to a break after the season ends and Mbeumo has been enjoying his. The 25-year-old was at the Canadian F1 Grand Prix last weekend, marking three weeks since the 2024/25 campaign ended.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to return from his holidays in the next two weeks before pre-season starts. However, the start of July is important for another reason.",
      "Club contracts run from the beginning of July to the end of June, with Premier League clubs usually releasing their annual financial accounts in the summer. The deadline to submit accounts to Companies House is at the end of June.",
      "A new financial year begins in July, a key indicator for clubs to kickstart their business to comply with Financial Fair Play and Profit & Sustainability Rules. Concerns over United's compliance with the rules have emerged in the last year and it could be the case that Mbeumo's signing is being delayed until the new financial year.",
      "That means that even if Mbeumo comes in before the end of June, there will be a delay for the new signing. A new striker is expected to be the priority with Viktor Gyokeres tentatively linked, but a move for a centre-forward is almost certain to come after July.",
      "United's first pre-season friendly takes place in Sweden against Leeds United on July 19. Pre-season is expected to be some time before that with July 7 a likely start day, so there is no rush.",
      "However, by the time United travel to the United States to take part in the Premier League Summer Series to face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton, fans will be desperate to have Mbeumo part of the squad."

      "The schedule for the 2025/26 season will be unveiled on Wednesday at 9am, laying out the structure for the 380 matches to be contested among the 20 sides. The process, according to Premier League insiders, is carried out at random by an external IT firm called Atos.",
      "Ferguson, however, expressed discontent with the sequence of games his side had at the start of 2009, suggesting the fixtures were arranged to purposefully disadvantage the Red Devils. In the 2008/09 season, the Red Devils were scheduled to play away against nine of the top ten teams from the prior season in the first half of the campaign.",
      "Adding to his frustration, Ferguson noted the Red Devils had to play away immediately after each of their three Champions League fixtures on the continent. Addressing the media before an FA Cup third-round match against Southampton more than 16 years ago, the legendary manager held no punches with his views on the situation.",
      "Ferguson said: \"I've been saying this for a few months, but our fixture programme didn't do us any favours. I think we have been handicapped by the Premier League. They tell me it's not planned - bloody hell!\"",
      "After reporters probed further into whether he felt the Premier League actively sought to impede United, Ferguson said: \"I've got my doubts. I'm not saying what they do down there.",
      "\"But next year we'll be sending somebody to see how it happens, I can assure you. I just don't understand how you can get the fixtures like that.\"",
      "The previous summer, United had the chance to voice any concerns about the Premier League fixture list but opted not to. The league's officials responded to Ferguson's remarks with a robust statement.",
      "\"The police also approve it before it is sent to the clubs, at which point they can raise any objections they may have. There are various factors that go into the structuring of the fixture list - police requests, club requests, involvement in European or FIFA competitions for example - but the overriding factor is the luck of the draw.\"",
      "Despite the challenging fixture schedule, United managed to clinch the Premier League title, edging out Liverpool by four points. During that era, Ferguson was not the only figure who expressed doubts about the scheduling.",
      "At the start of the 2005/06 season, Jose Mourinho, then in his second term at Chelsea, told the People newspaper: \"It is always Chelsea who get the worst games, the worst fixtures to play, while Arsenal always have the best ones.\"",
      "His remarks were made soon after the fixture list was revealed. Chelsea were down to play away matches following their first five Champions League games, while Arsenal were set to play at home after their European fixtures. Similarly to United, it did not stop the Blues from winning the Premier League that campaign."

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has admitted he is hopeful new signing Matheus Cunha will bring flair and creativity to Old Trafford after recently arriving from Wolves.",
      "After announcing they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign the 26-year-old on the opening day of the summer transfer window, United confirmed Cunha's arrival at Old Trafford last Thursday.",
      "He has signed a five-year deal, featuring the option of an additional year, after United triggered the £62.5million release clause in his contract at Molineux.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024/25, including 15 in the Premier League, meaning he will be determined to produce similar numbers in his maiden season at Old Trafford. He is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 spot in the Reds' attack.",
      "Signed to bring goals and creativity to United's blunt attack, Berrada believes he could prove to be \"Eric Cantona-esque\", admitting he has the swagger to lift the fans to their feet.",
      "Speaking to United We Stand, the United CEO said: \"He's a player that I think fans are going to love. We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "\"He's a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he's going to lift people off their seats.",
      "\"He's got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, Cantona-esque.\"",
      "Well-versed in the No.10 position from his time at Wolves, Cunha is a perfect fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. The United head coach wants to strengthen his attacking department with up to three new faces this summer and Cunha was identified as a top target several months before the window opened.",
      "With United in desperate need of fresh blood in attack, supporters should be energised by Berrada's comments about Cunha, who they will be hoping can live up to the billing.",
      "Interestingly, Berrada's comments about Cunha being a player that is capable of getting supporters out of their seats run parallel with former United captain Roy Keane's opinion of the Brazilian international.",
      "Speaking in January 2024, Keane said of Cunha: \"He's a talented player. He's lively. Every time he gets the ball you think something's going to happen.",
      "\"[He is a] really exciting player, he has the ability to beat players. He's got that pace, he looks a very natural player off the cuff. I like the look of him, big player.\"",
      "Of course, the proof will be in the pudding, and not until Cunha settles into life at Old Trafford will anyone be able to make a firm judgement on if he can deliver the goods in M16.",
      "However, he has already earned plenty of praise and the seal of approval from one of United's biggest critics in the form of Keane."

      "After spending £81.3million on Antony in September 2022 and an initial £64m on Rasmus Hojlund 11 months later, Manchester United know what it's like to get stung in the transfer market.",
      "United spent the entirety of the 2022 summer transfer window chasing Antony's tail, confident that a reunion with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford would fix their long-term right-wing problems.",
      "Having never once stepped foot in one of Europe's top five leagues, the fee United paid Ajax to bring Antony to England was nothing short of astronomical. United had been reluctant to meet Ajax's demands for much of the summer.",
      "Less than three years later, United have made Antony one of three players they want to sell as a priority this summer. They need to bank £32.5m for him to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability [PSR] regulations.",
      "Antony will go down as one of the Premier League's greatest flops. Perhaps the greatest. No club wants to be associated with that particular tag.",
      "The addition of Antony, likewise Hojlund the following summer, is a prime example of just how reckless United have been in their spending in recent years. They have had their pants pulled down far too often, sometimes through sheer desperation to get a deal over the line.",
      "Both Ajax and Atalanta must not have been able to believe their luck when United agreed to such big-money deals to sign two raw and unproven attackers. Chelsea, too, must have been rubbing their hands together when they pocketed an initial fee of £55m for Mason Mount with just one year remaining on his contract in July 2023.",
      "Recruitment failings have been a massive contributor to United's decline. Too many deals have been conducted without football specialists or recruitment gurus overseeing them.",
      "However, under Ineos' leadership, United have offered signs of encouragement on the recruitment front. Although last summer's recruitment was not perfect, it was certainly better than what had been served up in previous years.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui arrived for a bargain base fee of just £12.8m and Leny Yoro, who is widely regarded as one of the most promising centre-backs in world football, was drafted in with the ambition of making him a mainstay in United's defence for years to come.",
      "With a sensible recruitment strategy in place, United will believe they are on the right track in their quest to achieve 'Project 150' in 2028 and win both the Premier League and the Women's Super League.",
      "Having laid the foundations and offered an insight into how they plan to recruit under Ineos' stewardship last summer, United are trying to raise the bar again this summer. Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves for £62.5m and United hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will be the next arrival.",
      "United want to move at speed this summer to get the squad in as good a position as possible ahead of the start of the 2025/26 season, and the addition of Cunha so early on in the window is a reflection of their ambitions.",
      "Just days after confirming they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Cunha, United saw a £55m offer turned down for Mbeumo. Yes, the offer fell short of Brentford's valuation, but it once again highlighted how keen the club is to get on with rebuilding the squad this summer.",
      "As hungry as United are for new additions, they need to ensure they find the right balance between moving at speed and not paying over the odds and repeating mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" chief executive Omar Berrada recently told United We Stand.",
      "\"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Every club dreams of getting deals done quickly. It is every coach's dream to have the bulk of his business done in time for the start of pre-season.",
      "That, however, is a dream that rarely becomes a reality. Nevertheless, United are actively working to get new signings through the door.",
      "As commendable as that particular element is, United also deserve recognition for trying to distance themselves from mistakes of the past. They understand and embrace the hunger for signings, but they are not prepared to have their pants pulled down again."

      "The 25-year-old's stock is currently high after scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford in the 2024/25 campaign. United view him as the second of three attacking signings they would like to make this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been added to United's attack, arriving from Wolves last week after his £62.5m release clause was triggered, and they still want to add Mbeumo and an out-and-out centre-forward.",

      "Despite his former boss being keen on a reunion in north London, Mbeumo has informed confidants that United, just as they were two weeks ago, remain his preferred choice. He has his sights set on playing at Old Trafford and making a name for himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United lost to Spurs in last month's Europa League final, of course, meaning the Londoners secured Champions League qualification for next season at their expense. Champions League football is the holy grail for most players, meaning it would be easy to understand why Mbeumo could favour a move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium over Old Trafford.",
      "However, despite United being unable to offer any form of European football in 2025/26, Mbeumo remains keen to move to M16. And it is players of that mindset and mentality United need to recruit this summer.",
      "Furthermore, it has highlighted Amorim was right that any player will always dream of playing for United's because of their history and heritage.",
      "Speaking in April, Amorim said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club.",
      "\"I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea.",
      "\"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "There is no denying the fact the 2024/25 campaign was a forgettable period in United's history, but one bad season cannot undo all of the pomp and pageantry that comes with arguably the biggest sporting institution in the world.",
      "United will always appeal to players and they have clearly caught Mbeumo's attention. The fact he is so keen on joining United at this current juncture is also a positive reflection of his character and mentality."

Hojlund had to wait a year for Anthony Martial's outstayed welcome to expire before he assumed the number.

      "United bought two centre backs and a right back before a defensive midfielder when the glaring issue in their madcap 2023-24 campaign was the absence of a shield in front of the back four. Erik ten Hag had two No.6s but Casemiro was injury-prone and Sofyan Amrabat not entrusted until the final two weeks of the season. He was not signed permanently.",
      "Two years ago, a starting striker was essential. The belated call on David de Gea's future made a new goalkeeper inevitable and Andre Onana came in less than three weeks after his predecessor brought down the curtain on 12 years at United.",
      "United had been yearning for a goalscorer for a year. At the start of United's 2023 pre-season tour in New Jersey, we stopped Ten Hag in the mixed zone for an impromptu chat. When did he hope the striker would arrive?",
      "\"Last year!\" he chuckled. Cristiano Ronaldo's heart was no longer in it at United in his second season. Martial's body had more breakdowns than a day on the M6 and United had quietly bade farewell to Wout Weghorst, scorer of two tap-ins in 31 games.",
      "Hojlund was the last of the three major incomings, a deal still concluded early enough for him to be introduced to United fans before their pre-season friendly with Lens at Old Trafford. The downside was a stress fracture of his back delayed his debut by four more weeks.",
      "In Ten Hag's first window, a midfield linchpin was sought. United travelled to Thailand and Australia that summer while Frenkie de Jong headed to the United States with Barcelona. A deal for De Jong always seemed as distant.",
      "Two damaging results to Brighton and Brentford later, United were panicked into a £70m deal for Casemiro in late August. Without Casemiro, they might not have qualified for the Champions League that season.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was one of the weakest United managers, which may account for the enviable backing he often enjoyed. Whether you regarded a winger or a centre back as United's priority in 2021, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane were United's first two buys and they had both in the building before the season started.",
      "The 2020 window was unique amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with United restricted to a four-week turnaround between the seasons. They had also been bolstered by the season-changing winter signing of Bruno Fernandes.",
      "With a back five firmly established and United inundated with midfielders, an incisive forward was wanted. Sancho and Jack Grealish were unattainable. Donny van de Beek was on the same shortlist as the latter and, even with the protocols about isolating, was able to debut in United's first fixture.",
      "Solskjaer had to wait a while for Harry Maguire in 2019, a summer infamous for United's one-at-a-time strategy. With the transfer window's closure date brought forward to before the start of the season, United spent roughly a month apiece to bring in Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka before the world-record £80m they spent on Maguire in August.",
      "2018-19 had been United's worst defensive season in 40 years after Ed Woodward failed, or refused, to furnish Jose Mourinho with a new centre back. Maguire, also coveted by Mourinho, was priced at £75m by Leicester in 2018 and left for only £5m more a year later. Mourinho is the only modern United manager to be deprived of a priority target.",
      "Cunha has been rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, two Brazilians who got away from United. The club has a dire hit-rate with Brazilian players but Cunha is the first to join them who has already played in the Premier League.",
      "So has Bryan Mbeumo. Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland are the only players who scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in 2024-25. Mbeumo tallied a superb 20. Cunha got 15.",
      "Nobody would expect, or want, either to lead the line for United. They have needed a proven goalscorer for three years and Liam Delap is not that. Delap is not a miss but missing out on him will prolong United's search for a striker, almost certainly into July. Perhaps even August.",

      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",

      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",

      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",

      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",

      "18) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",

      "20) 🔽 Rassmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Inter Milan\nInter were one of few clubs who looked like taking Hojlund off United’s hands. But they are heading in a different direction – specifically, that of Parma striker Ange-Yoan Bonny. A £21million deal has been agreed between the clubs, but personal terms still need to be discussed, giving Napoli time to swoop.",

      "18) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Napoli\nWe almost want this to happen just to see Antonio Conte’s head fall off by Christmas. We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli. And reports suggest he has no intention of lowering his demands. Another loan beckons.",

      "15) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",
      "",
      "14) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation and the fact that the Brazilian’s mate says he wants to live in London. Hide all the maps, lads.",

We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. Swap deals don’t happen anymore – unless they a PSR tickle – but this could actually work, if there’s any truth in it.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "9) 🔼 Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",

      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £116.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga for everyone to get very worked up about. Regardless, we are now at the point of arranging a medical, which is set for Friday, apparently. Stand by your flight trackers, Reds.",

      "According to reports, one Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the Premier League giants for Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "This summer is vital for the Red Devils as they need to make several statement signings after finishing 15th in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Man Utd are preparing for a season without European football, but they have still fended off competition to sign Matheus Cunha for around £62.5m from Wolves and they are ‘very close’ to their second summer signing.",
      "It has been widely reported that they will need several high-profile exits to balance the books and Jadon Sancho is among their outcasts expected to move on.",

      "READ: Arsenal and Man Utd ‘nightmare start’ as Premier League fixture day delivers again",
      "The England international joined Chelsea after his major fallout with former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag in September 2023 condemned him to an exit.",
      "Sancho had a mixed spell at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea opted against signing him permanently, paying a £5m penalty fee to Man Utd to cancel a permanent deal.",
      "While Sancho has been at Chelsea, Man Utd have changed their head coach as Ruben Amorim has replaced Ten Hag last year, but he still doesn’t have a future at Old Trafford as the Red Devils are looking to offload him.",
      "Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur have been mooted as possible destinations for Sancho, but Serie A giants Napoli also interested in him.",
      "However, this deal could still fall through as Man Utd have made a ‘high request’ to Napoli as they hold out for a €25 million fee, even though Sancho’s contract is due to expire in 2026.",
      "Italian reporter Vincenzo Morabito reckons Man Utd “need to lower their expectations for Sancho” to offload him this summer.",
      "“Ruben Amorim has made it very clear he does not want Sancho or Marcus Rashford in pre-season training,” Morabito said",
      "“Manchester United are going to have to lower their expectations for Sancho, because they cannot ask for €25m for a player who has one year left on his contract and earns €18m per season wages.",
      "“This operation is feasible, but we need to see how tough Manchester United can be holding out here, because Sancho is a good player and did pretty well at Chelsea. Cristiano Giuntoli wanted to bring him to Juventus last year, but then it didn’t go through.”",

      "Everton could raid Man City for an unwanted duo, Arsenal and Liverpool might fancy a left-field signing, and Leeds should consider a Newcastle United outcast.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes, starting with two City cast-offs…",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker to Everton\nWalker might be past his best, but there’s no doubt he would improve the Everton back-line. And he’d fit in perfectly as another old fogey in a defence that’s already home to Seamus Coleman, who turns 37 in October. Walker turned 35 in May, while Nathan Patterson, 12 years his junior, remains awfully injury-prone.",
      "The England right-back would have to take a pay-cut to join Everton, but his desire to stay in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad trumps money, amid reported interest from Fenerbahce. That ambition paid off in January when the Manchester City defender chose AC Milan over Saudi Arabia, and has been rewarded with a 100% call-up rate under the new England boss. The same logic could apply if Walker joins Everton and performs at a decent level.",
      "He’s desperate to reach 100 caps. And while Fenerbahce are hardly a nothing club that would ruin those hopes, proving he can still cut it in the Premier League (not the Turkish Super Lig) would be far more beneficial to that end.",
      "As for Everton, there’s obviously some risk given Walker’s recent decline. But he’s still an upgrade on Coleman and Patterson, though the latter’s potential is miles beyond Walker’s current level.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Everton\nSticking with Manchester City players moving to Everton’s shiny new stadium, we’re very intrigued by the prospect of Grealish making this move.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Serie A champions Napoli, which is obviously the better option, unless he doesn’t want to leave England. Grealish would be a pretty like-for-like replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who left Naples for Paris Saint-Germain in January, and the move would ensure he’s playing Champions League football next season.",
      "However, this is all about intra-Premier League transfers, so enough of that Italian muck. If recent rumours are anything to go by, Everton are showing real ambition ahead of their move from Goodison Park to the Hill Dickinson Stadium, with new owners the Friedkin Group keen to usher in a new era with better players. It makes sense; and if Man City can ship both Grealish and Walker off to Merseyside on permanent deals, they’ll be thrilled.",
      "We miss the old Grealish and reckon David Moyes might give him the freedom to express himself, even though his wingers do have defensive duties. Show him the love and let him thrive in the final third, and Grealish will repay it by tracking back and doing his bit in the low block. We really hope he stays in the Premier League.",
      "MORE: Premier League players who need a summer transfer for World Cup place: Grealish, Chiesa…",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling to Fulham\nChelsea and their latest bomb squad deserve their own feature, but for now, we’re trying to work out where the hell Raheem Sterling ends up after an underwhelming loan spell at Arsenal.",
      "“People like to talk, don’t they? Well so do I. And I’ll say this – you’re about to see the best of me,” Sterling said after joining the Gunners on deadline day last August. No further comment.",
      "He scored a single goal (against League One Bolton) in 28 matches for Arsenal, and it’s clear his days of playing for a top club are behind him after spells with Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City.",
      "The 82-cap England international needs a fresh start, but we also reckon staying in London could be a crucial factor in where he goes next. He seems quite Fulham, doesn’t he? At Craven Cottage, Sterling can quietly go about his business and either score two in 30 or 15 in 30, and nobody would really bat an eyelid. Though the latter might even be enough to get him back into the England squad.",
      "Marco Silva needs to bolster his attack, particularly on the left, and if Sterling’s wage demands are realistic, the 30-year-old could enjoy a renaissance for Chelsea’s west London neighbours.",
      "",
      "Sean Longstaff to Leeds\nPlenty of Newcastle supporters will be happy to see Longstaff go, though there’ll be a few staunch Geordies upset to lose a homegrown player.",
      "What’s certain is that Eddie Howe’s Newcastle have outgrown him. Rumours of a move to Leeds make sense for both Daniel Farke and the player. He’s not the most exciting addition, but Premier League experience will be crucial if any of the promoted trio are to buck the trend and avoid the drop. Signing a bunch of youngsters from abroad isn’t going to cut it.",
      "Longstaff will run all day, and that sort of effort will quickly win over the Elland Road faithful. He can chip in with goals and is comfortable enough on the ball to hold his own in midfield for a newly promoted side.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Tottenham Hotspur\nGarnacho to Chelsea has been six months in the making, but at this point, he’s nothing more than an alternative to Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens. A move to the aforementioned Napoli now seems far more likely for the Argentine.",
      "With that in mind, we’ve gone with a transfer to Spurs, who are expected to miss out on Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, now bound for Manchester United.",
      "Six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League games in 2024/25 was an underwhelming return for a player tipped to become a star at Old Trafford. Even at 20, he needs a fresh start, and Ruben Amorim has reportedly made it clear that’s exactly what he should pursue.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez to Arsenal\nA transfer feature isn’t really a transfer feature without linking Arsenal with a striker. Darwin is admittedly a left-field option for Mikel Arteta, but the Spaniard’s eclectic transfer record means we wouldn’t put it past him. If he can turn Kai Havertz into a competent centre-forward, he might back himself to do the same with the Liverpool maverick.",
      "Arsenal are crying out for an elite striker, and that’s exactly what Nunez was supposed to be at Anfield. Perhaps under different management and in a more structured system, he could still become that.",
      "MORE: Sesko, Gyokeres, Watkins: Which striker should Arsenal sign?",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford to Liverpool\nThis is another left-field ‘hear us out’ shout, but one we’re fully behind for multiple reasons, the most compelling of which is that it’d be really very funny.",
      "Arne Slot is thought to be prioritising a more natural striker than a wide forward, but Rashford is capable of playing through the middle – more so than Cody Gakpo or Luis Diaz, anyway. And with the latter being targeted by Barcelona, a cut-price Rashford could be the ideal signing to maintain the depth that helped Liverpool cruise to the Premier League title.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko to Brentford\nClearly in need of a left-back – having used Keane Lewis-Potter there for much of last season – Brentford could do a lot worse than Zinchenko. The Ukrainian is renowned for his world-class technical ability, even if his defending remains a concern.",
      "A move abroad still looks the likeliest outcome, but with a year left on his contract, Arsenal are desperate to sell this summer, opening the door for a surprise Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix to Wolves\nPortuguese? Check. Jorge Mendes client? You bet. Surplus to requirements at his current club? Absolutely. Welcome to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Joao Felix.",
      "We’ve already endorsed a move to Leeds, so it’s abundantly clear where we think his level is now after disappointing spells with Chelsea, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid. He’s still technically a Blues player but is certain to leave permanently this summer. Saudi Arabia feels extremely likely for the failed wonderkid, but the most plausible Premier League landing spot for him is Portugal C Wolves.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho to Crystal Palace\nAssuming they will be playing in Europe next season (these things always work themselves out), Palace will need a bit more depth across the pitch. They should feel confident going into a Europa League campaign with a manager who’s won the competition, and adding someone like Sancho would only add to that confidence.",
      "Sancho might think FA Cup winners Palace are beneath him, but we’re not so sure. He doesn’t have a future at Manchester United – even if Ruben Amorim hasn’t tried him out yet – and he flopped on loan at Chelsea, who paid £5m to send him back.",
      "Like a few on this list, the 25-year-old will probably move abroad, but if he stays in England, we really like this shout.",
      "",
      "Kalvin Phillips to Leeds\nPhillips to Leeds is a bonus inclusion, full of sentimental value.",

      "",

      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will cost more on his own."

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘positive and instructive’ talks with the camp of a European striker after they ‘approached’ the Red Devils for a transfer.",
      "United struggled in front of goal in the Premier League last season. They were not far above scoring a single goal a game – 44 in 38 – and their strikers were very underwhelming.",
      "Between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, despite the pair both playing more than 30 games, there were just seven goals scored.",
      "United know they need to rectify that, and after signing Matheus Cunha for the attack, they are still on the hunt for a No.9 to fully transform the forward areas.",
      "One might have fallen into their lap, as FootballTransfers reports the camp of Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic – who has 56 goals in 142 games there – have ‘approached’ United directly.",
      "It’s said he is ‘increasingly pushing’ for a move to the club, with Old Trafford his ‘dream destination’. Indeed, Vlahovic is motivated by the idea of working under Ruben Amorim and playing in a more ‘open, physically demanding league’.",
      "United have held direct talks with the Serbian striker after the approach from his agent, as they ‘intensify efforts’ to land a ‘reliable’ No.9.",
      "The talks have been described as ‘positive and instructive’, which suggests it’s a move which could have legs.",
      "Vlahovic’s €45million (£38.5m) price tag is said to represent promising value for United.",
      "There might be some concern that their last two striker signings came from Italy, and have not had a great time of it at Old Trafford. Indeed, Hojlund had scored nine Serie A goals before his move, and Zirkzee 11.",
      "But Vlahovic’s best return in his Serie A career so far is 21 goals, and he’s passed 15 on three occasions.",
      "Every single season he has played at Juventus, the striker has scored at least 10 league goals, so there should be more confidence on the reliability of the 25-year-old than in the previously signed strikers.",
      "It is believed one of the main challenges will be Vlahovic’s salary. Juve are willing to get rid as the striker’s ‘lavish contract’ is proving a heavy burden now.",
      "He earns a reported €373,000 per week, which equates to around £319,000 per week, and Casemiro is the only player at United who earns over that.",
      "Whether the club will allow the Serbian to become one of their top two highest earners immediately remains to be seen.",

      "",
      "Inter Milan – swapped Clarence Seedorf for Francesco Coco\nOnly Clarence Seedorf could swap Inter for AC Milan and still remain respected by the Nerazzurri. He crossed the Milan divide in 2002, with Italy international Francesco Coco heading in the opposite direction. The right-footed left-back tried to usurp Paolo Maldini as the Rossoneri’s left-back, the daft b*stard.",
      "There’s no disgrace in failing to shift actual Paolo Maldini, but there also was no justification for Inter placing equal value on Coco and Seedorf, despite the Netherlands star having cost £20million just two years before.",
      "Milan got a decade’s worth of service out of Seedorf, who won two Serie A titles, a couple of European Cups and could probably still boss a midfield aged around 68. Coco spent his five years at Inter either injured, on loan, chasing the opposite sex – “naturally, women are among my thoughts” he said in an interview in 2001 – or trying to forge a TV career.",
      "Having fluffed a trial at Manchester City in early 2007 after turning up puffing on a cigarette, Coco retired upon the early termination of his Inter contract and reportedly became a real estate agent in Milan after returning from Hollywood with his tail between his legs.",

      "Inter Milan – swapped Fabio Cannavaro and Fabian Carini\nInter got the raw end of the Seedorf-Coco deal but Juventus really pulled their pants down two years later.",
      "According to Cannavaro, he was ‘ditched’ by Inter, regardless of his desire to stay. So he moved to Turin on the same deadline day as Zlatan Ibrahimovic – a decent day’s work by anyone’s standards – in exchange for reserve goalkeeper Fabian Carini, with both players supposedly valued at around 10million euros, despite Cannavaro having cost 23million euros two years before and Carini never having played in Juve’s first team.",
      "The centre-half shook off the injury problems he had suffered during his second season at Inter to establish himself as Italy’s World Cup-winning captain and one of the game’s finest defenders. He made 96 appearances in two seasons, winning the Ballon d’Or, before joining Real Madrid when the Calciopoli scandal saw Juve relegated to Serie B.",
      "Carini, despite being Uruguay No.1, made only four Inter appearances in three years. He had as much success usurping Francesco Toldo and Julio Cesar as he enjoyed trying to dislodge Gianluigi Buffon from the Juventus goal. Carini also failed to establish himself during a loan spell at Cagliari before moving to Spain to sit on Murcia’s bench.",
      "",
      "Barcelona – swapped Samuel Eto’o, Alexander Hleb on loan +£40million for Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nThis one certainly didn’t go as Barcelona expected when they presented Zlatan, the previous season’s highest scorer in Serie A, as their new striker in July 2009.",
      "Zlatan couldn’t get along with Pep Guardiola. After Barca lost to Ibra’s old Inter side in the 2010 Champions League semi-final, the striker revealed how he confronted his coach.",
      "“Guardiola was staring at me and I lost it. I thought, ‘there is my enemy, scratching his bald head!’ I yelled: ‘You haven’t got any b***s!’ and worse than that I added: ‘You can go to hell!’ I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he’s a spineless coward.”",

      "Hleb never made it to the San Siro. After falling out with Guardiola having not played regularly since leaving Arsenal, the Belarusian winger decided a year – possibly longer had Inter taken up their option to buy for £9million – under Mourinho wasn’t for him so he joined Stuttgart instead.",

      "Sanchez caused United no end of grief, though it was largely a mess of the club’s making. Upon signing Sanchez, who had less than a year remaining on his Arsenal contract, in a straight swap deal valued at around £35million, the Red Devils made his agent’s dreams come true.",
      "For his enormous, record-breaking salary, Sanchez brought five goals in 45 appearances. The Chilean didn’t fancy it and boy did it show.",
      "“The first training I had I realised many things,” he reflected after being allowed to join Inter for free. “I came home and I told my representative: ‘Can’t the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?’ They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me.”",
      "Mkhitaryan scored more goals in fewer appearances for Arsenal before he was shipped off to Italy. But the Armenian was no trouble. Arsenal shifted Sanchez – who they looked set to lose for free – while taking a useful squad player. United saddled themselves with a huge liability.",

      "“We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men’s first team but we are committed to making the women’s team very successful. You’ve heard Jim say, if you’re wearing the United shirt then you must win, and that’s exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and to contribute to women’s football.",
      "“Overall, it’s establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. And if you ask me today, can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "“We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power? There have been other turnarounds and other big teams have had bad seasons and gone on to win the Premier League or La Liga.”",
      "He added: “I firmly believe that we can do it (win the Premier League in 2028).",

      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",

      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",

      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",

      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season; Spurs have held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal; Man Utd also interested in Mbeumo; Forward's valuation is in excess of £60m",
      "Monday 16 June 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo says he \"accepts\" the speculation surrounding his future amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Spurs have held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach.",
      "Manchester United are also interested in Mbeumo, and had a bid rejected for him before Spurs started talks to hire Frank. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation, which is in excess of £60m.",
      "\"I think it can be the life of a footballer and you need to accept it.\"",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals in a Brentford side that finished 10th and narrowly missed out on European football.",
      "\"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League,\" he added. \"And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Brentford's impressive season led to Spurs hiring Frank as their new head coach and Mbeumo expects the Dane to succeed at his new club.",
      "\"He's done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think he developed the team so well.",
      "\"He developed me as a human and a player as well. So I can only wish him all the best, and I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"I think he knows everything. He's really smart. He knows where he wants to bring the team, how he wants to play. I think he's been fantastic for Brentford.",
      "\"I think he's going to have some time to adapt, obviously. [Champions League] games, more expectations, as you said, but I'm sure he's going to do well.",
      "\"He knows how to talk to people. He knows how to build a group. And that's why we've been playing so well.\"",
      "Brentford's set-piece coach Keith Andrews is one of the main candidates to replace Frank as head coach.",
      "Andrews had been part of Frank's coaching staff since last year and is well-regarded within the club.",
      "Brentford promoted from within last time they required a new head coach, with Frank having been Dean Smith's assistant.",
      "Andrews is one of a handful of names Brentford are seriously considering, but a final decision has not yet been made.",
      "\"It's big shoes to fill,\" Mbeumo said. \"I think, (Frank had) seven years as a head coach. So, obviously it's going to be changing, but let's see.\"",

      "By Sky Germany",
      "Thursday 12 June 2025 22:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, according to Sky Germany.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also thought to be interested in the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal.",
      "It is understood United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for Ekitike with Frankfurt demanding around £85m (€100m).",
      "United are in the market for a striker after the arrival of Wolves' Matheus Cunha and the potential signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Chelsea and Liverpool considered among the next landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Read more about Hugo Ekitike's rise",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers."
