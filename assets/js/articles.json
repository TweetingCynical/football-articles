      "Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly told Bruno Fernandes they had to win the Premier League title after signing for Manchester United in 2021. Four years on, United are on track for their worst-ever finish in the Premier League - just two places above the relegation zone - without any European football next season and a squad desperately in need of revamping.",
      "Ronaldo made his sensational return to Old Trafford on transfer deadline day in August 2021, signing from Juventus for a fee of £12.86million. The return of the Portuguese legend, who had previously won a Ballon d'Or and three Premier League titles with the club, was greeted with great enthusiasm and hope.",
      "The Red Devils had just ended the previous season as runners-up under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and had already made exciting additions like Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane to the squad earlier that summer.",
      "The plan was that by adding one of the greatest goal-scorers of all time to their ranks, United would return to their glory days and secure their first league triumph since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013.",
      "As per The Sun, Ronaldo showed his winning mentality even before setting foot at United. He is said to have spoken to his Portugal team-mate Fernandes, instructing the midfielder to tell the rest of the United squad that they needed to have faith in themselves and win the title that year.",
      "For a multitude of reasons, the Red Devils under Ralf Rangnick finished the season in sixth place, 35 points behind champions Manchester City. Ronaldo's contract would be ripped up by the end of 2022 after being frozen out by Rangnick's successor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "The now 40-year-old then completed a stunning transfer to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr, setting a trend for other ageing Premier League stars. Ten Hag's decision to part ways with the veteran forward was seemingly justified as he steered United back to a respectable third-place finish in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "However, since then, United have repeatedly hit new lows. A combination of poor recruitment and a mishmash of managers with differing philosophies has inflicted long-term damage on the club. And despite lifting the FA Cup in 2024, Ten Hag couldn't keep the sinking ship afloat and was sacked last October.",
      "Ruben Amorim, a fresh-faced and tactically innovative manager, fresh off winning the league with Portuguese side Sporting CP, was brought in soon after. But under the once jovial Portuguese head coach, the Red Devils have again set new unwanted records.",
      "Amorim has the distinction of having fewer points per game than any other United manager in the Premier League era, while also overseeing the most defeats, fewest victories and the lowest league tally in recent memory. The only silver lining was if he could have ended a disastrous season with some silverware and secured a Champions League spot by defeating Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "As it transpired, United's two biggest weaknesses - their blunt attack and error-prone goalkeeper - would result in them losing 1-0 to Spurs, who had not won a trophy in 17 years prior to Wednesday night. Any sliver of optimism vanished in Bilbao, and it was unclear how things could get any worse.",
      "That was, until, club captain Fernandes astonishingly offered to quit the club in his post-match interview. The 30-year-old, with at least two years still left on his contract, announced he is willing to leave if United bosses wish to cash in on him.",
      "\"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" Fernandes began by saying. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. On the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this. It's very sad. We wanted to win more than anything in this final. It's a very sad day because we've done some very good things in this competition until today.",
      "\"But today was the day that mattered, the most important day of the competition. It was the day we could have been in the history of the Europa League, but it's not like that. And football is cruel, and it's been our turn to lose.\"",
      "The Saudi outfit are participating in the tournament, which begins in the United States next month, and will be able to sign players from June 1.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Gareth Bale watched on with a smile as his old club Tottenham Hotspur lifted their first trophy in 17 years after defeating Manchester United. But the Welshman's story could have been very different had he not turned down the chance to join the Red Devils over the north London side.",
      "Almost two decades ago, a young Bale was catching eyes from full-back, scoring five goals and assisting 12 times across 45 appearances for then-Championship side Southampton. New Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was interested, but he faced stiff competition from Premier League giant Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United boardroom.",
      "Bale decided to turn down Ferguson, though, and head to north London in 2007 instead, telling his Airwayz channel in 2023 that this decision actually led to his success rather than any potential downfall.",
      "The 35-year-old said: \"I rejected Manchester United and went to Tottenham. At that time, United were the biggest team in the league, they were winning trophies, they had the biggest players, the best manager.",
      "\"The easiest decision would be to go to Man United and the biggest club. You always want to be at the biggest clubs but I took the approach that I wanted to be playing first-team football.\"",
      "But Bale bucked the trend; he chose Spurs and spent six seasons carving out a move from left-back to creative forward, scoring 42 goals in 142 appearances and impressing throughout his time in the Premier League.",
      "From there, the Welshman carved out a sensational transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 2013 for a then-world record fee of £85million. He joined superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria, Karim Benzema, Sergio Ramos, Casemiro and Luka Modric in the famous white kit, and spent nine seasons with the club.",
      "In this time, Bale scored 106 goals in 258 appearances, winning five Champions Leagues, three La Liga titles and a host of other honours. The attacker spent one season back on loan to Spurs, before joining Los Angeles FC and retiring in 2023 as one of the greatest players in both Welsh and footballing history.",
      "So while many would assume Bale would regret the decision to snub Ferguson and his Red Devils – who won the Premier League title under Sir Alex in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 – for Spurs, the retired winger insisted that a need for consistent game time at a young age was more important to him than money and glory.",
      "He added: \"At that age, a lot of players would go for the money and would want to go to a bigger club.",
      "\"But I was playing, developing and learning. It was an important part of my development to keep playing first-team football because you can't replicate that.\"",
      "Now, it seems that Bale will have the last laugh over the team that could've been but wasn't, as he made a sly joke at United's expense following their damaging European defeat this week.",
      "During TNT Sport's broadcast of Spurs' 1-0 Europa League final win, Bale was questioned on whether this win will get rid of the 'Spursy' tagline that the club are serial losers.",
      "He was quick to respond at United's woes, as he said: \"It could be a United-y thing now, I am telling you. But it gets rid of that stigma now for sure, and hopefully we can build on it.\"",

      "Only a whopping £60million would reportedly be enough to see Alejandro Garnacho depart Manchester United. That same transfer fee is also being bandied about as the figure that could clinch the signing of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "The 20-year-old Argentine has endured a difficult season. Man United sit 16th in the Premier League and are coming off a Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.",
      "Given that Garnacho was subject to bids from Chelsea and Napoli in the January transfer window, his future certainly doesn't seem settled, and his comments after Wednesday's final only added fuel to the fire.",
      "After coming on with just 20 minutes to go in Bilbao, the disgruntled winger not only questioned Ruben Amorim's decision to bench him in favour of Mason Mount but admitted he's not sure where his future lies beyond this season. \"Up until the final, I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision], but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "The Argentine's brother, Roberto Garnacho, took to Instagram to display his anger at the forward's minimal contribution in the final, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\".",
      "\"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus,\" wrote the United star's sibling.",
      "In the aftermath of the game, The Telegraph reported that the Premier League club may accept a bid of £60m for Garnacho, which could open the path for Amorim to reunite with Gyokeres for the same figure despite his release clause reported to be £83.6m.",
      "Leading Sporting CP to a second straight league title, the Sweden international has scored a whopping 53 goals in all competitions this season, making it 96 goals in just 101 games in his two seasons in Portugal.",
      "The 26-year-old has also been routinely linked with a transfer to Arsenal or Juventus, but despite the intense speculation surrounding his next move, his uncle says he could stay put in Portugal.",
      "Asked by Record whether the striker could continue his story in Lisbon, Chris Gyokeres said of his nephew: \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay. Yes, we think so. We hope so, because look… we love it, it's incredible, the country, the people and Sporting. And the Lions. We love it!\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres insists there are \"no hard feelings\" towards Ruben Amorim following his surprising mid-season exit from Sporting CP to Manchester United. Gyokeres has been sensational for the Portuguese side, scoring 53 goals and providing 13 assists in all competitions, including 39 strikes in the league alone.",
      "The Swede played a vital role in helping Sporting secure back-to-back league titles as he scooped the top scorer award for the second successive season. United are said to be vying for the striker's services, but they face tough competition, as reports suggest Arsenal are currently leading the chase for his signature.",
      "The bond between Gyokeres and his ex-boss Amorim may well influence the striker's decision, however, potentially luring him away from other clubs and towards a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "In an interview with SIC, the 26-year-old revealed his team's disappointment following Amorim's sudden exit but insisted there were no grudges regarding his decision to swap Jose Alvalade for Old Trafford.",
      "Gyokeres said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Before Amorim's departure, Sporting had embarked on an unbeaten streak domestically, claiming victory in each league match before he left in November.",
      "Reflecting upon the winning mentality set by the Portuguese manager, Gyokeres admitted he felt invincible under Amorim. \"I think when you're in that kind of moment where you keep winning, you go in with the same mentality as every game and you keep doing the same things and with the same rhythm,\" he added.",
      "\"That's what we felt when we went into the games. It's possible to have those kinds of moments, I don't know if we would have kept the same level throughout the season, because I think it's very normal in football for there to be stages of the season when you maybe win every game and then there's a period when it's tougher.",
      "\"Of course, we always have the mentality of wanting to win every game, but as we've seen in football, it doesn't always end that way. I think it's very difficult to go through an entire season without losing a single game, as you can see in history, I don't think many teams have done it. It's one thing to win a lot of games and another thing to go a whole season without losing a game.\"",
      "If United were to pursue Gyokeres this summer, the transfer fee would not be too expensive. A gentleman's agreement in the Swede's contract would allow him to leave for a fee of between £55million and £60m, significantly less than his £84.3m release clause.",
      "However, United's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final may jeopardise Amorim's plans to reunite with his former forward.",
      "The 1-0 loss to Spurs means that the Red Devils will not participate in European football in the 2025/26 season, making other clubs more attractive.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres has been non-committal about his plans for the summer. The sought-after striker is expected to leave for the Premier League but hasn't completely ruled out staying put.",
      "\"Hopefully, you can expect that I will keep improving and score goals,\" he said. \"In Portugal? Let's see, it's the future, and it's football as well, so you never know what's going to happen. As you've seen this season, you never know what's going to happen, and it's the same now. We will see in the future.\"",

      "Less than a year after being released by Manchester United, Brandon Williams has been sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years. And after recently saying it hurt him to watch football, the full back who had been tipped for the very top finds his career in tatters.",
      "Williams, 24, pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, with a balloon in his mouth, and hitting a top speed of 99mph before crashing his Audi A3 into a Ford Fiesta on the A34 near Handforth, Cheshire in August 2023.",
      "And on Friday he was handed a suspended 14-month prison sentence, 180 hours of community service and banned from driving for 30 months. This was not Williams’ first driving offence – he had already accumulated 30 points on his licence – but the damage caused remains untold.",
      "And although he avoided prison, there remains serious doubts over whether a player once so highly rated, has a future in the game - having not played a game for 12 months.",
      "Rare is the player who can return from such a long spell out of the game to hit the heights of before. And it is hard to predict whether clubs will eventually be willing to take a punt on someone with undoubted talent but too many red marks to his name.",
      "Williams joined United’s academy aged eight and made his first-team breakthrough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer while still a teenager in a Europa League draw away to AZ Alkmaar.",
      "And after an otherwise forgettable scoreless encounter Solskjaer was more than enthused by the left back’s bow. “You won’t see a better full debut from a full back anywhere,” Solskjaer said. “The boy is just going to improve and improve. He’s got the right mentality.”",
      "Plenty more opportunities followed with Williams finishing the 2019-20 season by making 36 appearances across all competitions. “He's been fantastic the few games he's played,” Solskjaer said later in that debut campaign. “The boy has no fear, he is as brave as a lion and he got us the win.”",
      "But as Williams recently said on the More Than A Match podcast, he found life “went from 0-100 real quick and that’s what people will never understand.”",
      "The pandemic affected him. While his team-mates were living in their gated mansions, he found life difficult living in a bedroom at his mum’s house. But the lockdown summer brought a four-year deal worth more than £50,000 per and external expectations were that he would kick on.",
      "There would be no regular starting spot during 2020-21 and he was sent on loan to Norwich City the following year.",
      "At Carrow Road, Williams featured semi-regularly as they were relegated to the Championship - and briefly landed himself in hot water because of an Instagram post apparently directed at Canaries fans who he claimed followed him home after a defeat to West Ham.",
      "He returned to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 but could not find a way into new head coach Erik ten Hag’s plans and found the attention from those in his outer circle was proving a distraction.",
      "With game time limited, the window for off-field distractions grew bigger. “It was difficult,” he added to More Than A Match. “You had family members you didn’t know was (sic) your family, friends you didn’t know was your mates.”",
      "Another loan, to Ipswich Town at the start of last season, brought a clean slate and the initial signs were promising. Except the Cheshire crash came a few days before. “At that point, I was in a bad situation, stuff was going on,” Williams said on the same podcast. He required hospital treatment before he was arrested and breathalysed but tests for drugs and alcohol were negative.",
      "Recorder Eric Lamb acknowledged that Williams had 'strong personal mitigation' after committing the offence at a time of depression.",
      "Still, prosecutors said that Williams - who had previously received driving bans of six months in October 2023 and 12 months in May 2024 - it was fortunate no one was killed from his “erratic driving.”",
      "Andrew Madden, senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, said Williams' driving \"clearly fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.” Mr Madden added: \"Witnesses said Williams kept speeding up and then braking sharply. It was clear he wasn't in control of the vehicle. The driving was erratic and the speed was grossly excessive. Eventually, Williams lost control completely and crashed.\"",
      "Now the career of a player that Manchester United had the highest hopes for is under serious doubt.",
      "Williams himself has suggested that continuing his playing career away from the glaring lights of the Premier League may be his best option. He said: \"I've had loads of teams trying to get me out - America, Europe and England - but I haven't been ready. I want to go somewhere 100% focused and kick on.",
      "\"I would like to experience that different culture. I'm only 24 so I could do three or four years abroad. Definitely Europe at a good club or an upcoming club.\"",

The 25-year-old recently recalled how he openly expressed his bitter disappointment in front of his team-mates and Amorim, though it didn’t sway the manager’s decision.",
      "Hjulmand told A Bola: \"We thought that Amorim would stay for the season and fight to also be a two-time champion. Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim, because he is a great coach.”",
      "When asked whether he felt betrayed, the Denmark international replied: “That’s a very strong word. We feel disappointed with his departure. We were on a run of 11 consecutive wins, doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything was very clear to everyone on the pitch. It was almost as if we were playing Playstation. Everyone knew what they had to do.",

      "“He himself said the same thing at the start of the season. But afterwards, I also told Ruben that we understood his decision.”",
      "Amorim revealed after his United move was announced that he had originally planned to leave Sporting at the end of the current 2024/25 season. Yet, he was informed that the offer from United wouldn't still be available come May.",
      "Speaking at the time of the United announcement, the Portuguese said: “We started very well this season and then Manchester United came in for me. They paid above the amount set for my release clause and the president of Sporting CP defended the club's interests.",
      "“I never argued about anything with the president regarding the negotiations. The only thing I asked during the process was that it take place at the end of the season.",
      "“I spent three days asking for this, but I was told it wasn’t possible. It was now or never, otherwise they would look for another option. I had three days to decide something that radically changes my life.”",
      "Amorim added: “I have to take steps forward in my career and it was harder for me than any other Sportinguista to leave. I knew that if I rejected Manchester United, in seven months' time I wouldn’t have that option available, and I knew that at the end of the season I was going to leave Sporting CP.",
      "“I could have felt a sense of regret that would be difficult to deal with. Between the disappointment of all Sportinguistas and taking risks in my career, or waiting for the end of the season and not having the only club that I wanted to join as an option, I had to decide. So I decided.”",
      "It’s unclear whether Amorim regrets that decision almost seven months on, having experienced an agonising first season at Old Trafford. During his tenure, United have consistently set new records for lows as the head coach struggles to impart his philosophy at the already-ailing club.",
      "With United ending the campaign just above the relegation zone and fresh off a disastrous Europa League final loss which ruled out European football next season, Amorim has made it clear that he is open to leaving this summer if club bosses and fans decide he is the wrong man for the job.",

      "“Witnesses said Williams kept speeding up and then breaking sharply. It was clear he wasn’t in control of the vehicle. The driving was erratic and the speed was grossly excessive. Eventually, Williams lost control completely and crashed.",
      "“It is fortunate no one was seriously injured or killed. To drive at 99mph in those circumstances was extremely dangerous and placed the lives of other road users at serious risk of harm. The Crown Prosecution Service wishes to thank the witnesses for supporting this prosecution.”",
      "England Under-21 international Williams' sentencing had originally been due to take place on May 9. However, it was subsequently pushed back by two weeks."

      "Manchester United have began to tell staff they have lost their jobs - just days after the club's agonising Europa League final defeat against Tottenham on Wednesday night. Ruben Amorim's men fell short in Bilbao as Brennan Johnson's scrappy goal secured a 1-0 win for Spurs and helped them end their 17-year wait for a trophy.",
      "United's defeat meant they won't be playing in the Champions League next season and have missed out on a £100million windfall in the process, another big blow for the club and their perilous financial situation.",
      "United staff were already told in February that 200 jobs were at risk, following 250 job cuts last year. Now, according to the Daily Mail, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his club chiefs have decided to inform some of those employees about their fate this week rather than let the disappointment of losing the final subside.",
      "It's claimed there has been some \"surprise\" at the club over the timing of the move considering the pain of losing the final is still so fresh.",
      "But after missing out on the lucrative prize that the trophy win would have guaranteed, the club are now desperate to save as much money as possible as they continue their bid towards profitability.",
      "Ratcliffe revealed that United were on course to be broke by Christmas if they did not introduce their brutal cost-cutting measures.",
      "These have included scrapping free lunches for staff in the canteen, upping ticket prices, slashing concessions and removing Sir Alex Ferguson from his £2m-a-year ambassadorial role.",
      "The report also adds that \"morale is low\" at Old Trafford, especially after the departures of popular and long-serving staff members, with Ratcliffe earning the unwanted nickname 'The Jim Reaper'. The British billionaire insisted these were difficult yet necessary changes to bring success back to United.",
      "He said: \"I know it's unpopular, and this period of change is uncomfortable for people, and some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. But they are necessary to put Manchester United back onto a stable footing. If people want to see Manchester United winning trophies again then we have to do all this stuff.",
      "\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\""

      "And now the autopsy begins with Amorim ready to rip up his underperforming squad, with some unpopular decisions set to be made. That includes potentially cashing in on some of the club's academy graduates, with one perhaps at the front of the queue.",

      "To make things worse, his brother, Roberto, added fuel to the fire by describing how Alejandro was \"thrown under the bus\" by the former Sporting coach upon learning he will be on the bench. Now, Amorim has to respond harshly and take a leaf out of Sir Alex Ferguson's book and show Garnacho the door rather than make it look like the Spanish-born Argentine has full control of the situation.",

Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roy Keane were all stalwarts during their careers at Old Trafford but one wrong step in the manager's eyes and you were gone without a second thought.",
      "It is not like it was an off-the-cuff comment either from the Madrid-born player. Just hours before the final even started, Garnacho posted pictures on his Instagram page celebrating after scoring the opening goal in the FA Cup final last season - which United went on to win against arch-rivals Manchester City. This is not a player who is just assessing his options. This is a player who is clearly controlling the narrative and the sooner that is shut down the better for Amorim if he is to maintain harmony in the dressing room as the season closes.",
      "Garnacho has crossed the line and now he has to face the consequences of this after questioning Amorim in the press. It will be the 40-year-old's first major test going into the summer transfer window as he looks to make a significant impact in the summer for the Red Devils.",
      "He has made the right move with the \"back me or sack me\" ultimatum (or bluff depending on how you have interpreted it) to the board but now he really needs to make an impact on the dressing room. It is not like the board will be reluctant either. He has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford in the previous transfer window - with Chelsea (currently at 4/1 to sign the Argentina international) previously rumoured to acquire his services with their ever-growing list of wingers - with the decision-makers at the club willing to listen in the past.",
      "No doubt Sir Jim Ratcliffe is licking his lips at the prospect of a big PSR win when selling the 20-year-old as the minority shareholder seeks a financial boost.",
      "It is a win-win situation for the Portuguese coach as he looks to really make his mark at United with the season set to end. Having previously stated he wanted to join United this summer instead of November last year, the former Benfica midfielder has endured six torrid months with the resources at his disposal with a squad who endured their worst ever Premier League campaign and worst league campaign in almost 50 years",

      "Manchester United have been forced to enact Plan B after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham on Wednesday night. United had hoped to triumph in Bilbao, qualify for next season's Champions League and recruit new players from a position of strength.",
      "Instead, they will have to make sweeping changes from the position of 16th in the Premier League, without any European football from which to tempt new players to join. Their miserable 1-0 loss against Spurs summed up everything that is wrong with the current squad and highlighted the need for fresh blood.",
      "United haven't wasted any time by making it clear that every single one of their players could be sold this summer. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not been afraid to implement changes since taking control of the club last February and this summer now looks set to be a painful one.",
      "The summer transfer window opens for business on June 1 this year and United are certain to be among the busiest clubs, with incomings and outgoings both required. Here are the latest reports involving the club as the fire sale awaits.",
      "There was a time when Bruno Fernandes was deemed untouchable, but that is no longer the case. United will consider bids for every single one of their squad, including the captain, who addressed a potential exit in the aftermath of defeat.",
      "\"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" Fernandes said. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days.",
      "\"In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was linked with a move to Chelsea or Napoli in the January transfer window and it appears as though a move could come to fruition this summer after he started the Europa League final on the bench.",
      "“Until we reached the final, I played every round,\" Garnacho said post-match. \"And I played 20 minutes today - I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "United need cash to reinvest in new players and Garnacho - who fanned the flames of rumour by putting his house up for sale recently - would be one of the easiest to shift, alongside loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Amorim will go into the summer transfer window armed with £100million to spend, according to The Guardian. United will make major changes to their squad following a dreadful debut campaign for Amorim - and they don't need to sell before they can buy.",
      "That's because Ratcliffe has taken an axe to the club, slashing jobs and expenditure in order to get the club on an even keel. It means that Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap could be bought before any sales are sorted. Cunha has a £62.5million release clause in his Wolves contract, while Delap will cost £30m from Ipswich.",
      "While negotiations to sign Cunha are going well, there is more competition for Delap, who has been courted by Chelsea and may decide to move to a team who can offer European football next season."

      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has admitted that they are interested in both Liverpool winger Luis Diaz and Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer. The summer transfer window is now just around the corner and Barca are weighing up moves for some high-profile targets.",
      "Diaz has been strongly linked with a move to La Liga this summer, with Arne Slot keen to refresh his attack. Both Diaz and Darwin Nunez could be on the move once the window opens, with Barca keen on Diaz and Atletico Madrid eyeing Nunez.",
      "Liverpool are yet to agree new terms with Diaz, whose current deal expires in June 2027, and Barca are lurking. Diaz’s father has previously said it would be a “dream” for his son to join the Catalan giants, although the winger has reaffirmed his happiness on Merseyside after winning the Premier League.",
      "Rashford, meanwhile, is poised to make a permanent move away from Manchester United following a successful loan spell with Aston Villa. He is understood to prefer a move to Barcelona ahead of a transfer to Villa or another Premier League rival.",
      "It seems he could get his wish, given Deco’s comments. \"We like Luis, we like Rashford, and we like other players,\" Deco told Catalan radio station RAC 1. \"Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.\"",
      "Barca announced a new contract until June 2028 for Raphinha on Thursday after a stunning campaign has seen him contribute 34 goals and 25 assists in 56 games. And securing their other key players remains the first priority for Hansi Flick’s side.",
      "\"If we can keep the core of the team together, that's what we want,\" Deco said. \"I think we can do it. I think you can always improve the team, but you have to understand what kind of player you need. We've focused first on what we have at home and renewals.",
      "\"The renewals of Raphinha, [Frenkie] De Jong, and Eric [Garcia] will come, for sure. That's the priority. We'll talk about improving the team if we can, but the key is stability. We don't believe that players will ask to leave.\"",
      "Barca are keen to reinforce their squad, though, with Robert Lewandowski heading into the final year of his contract. Luckily, they have a generational talent on their books in the form of Lamine Yamal, who Deco says has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Unsurprisingly, Barca would never consider selling. Instead they are plotting a new contract.",
      "\"Lamine has not asked for anything because we don't speak to players but to agents,\" he said. \"That's not his priority. I think a player has to have a contract that is fair, that corresponds to his value and I think that's what we're going to do.",
      "“You have to adapt Lamine's contract to his reality. He has to be the most important player among the most important players we have. He surely has other things that the others don't have.\""

      "Alan Shearer has tipped Ruben Amorim to leave Manchester United in the wake of their defeat in the Europa League final. United were beaten by Tottenham on Wednesday night in Bilbao.",
      "The 40-year-old has won just 16 of the 41 games he has taken of since replacing Erik ten Hag in November. He even admitted after Wednesday's defeat that he would be happy to leave his post should the board decide he is not the right man for the job.",
      "While it is understood that United bosses are content with Amorim for now, Shearer is unconvinced over his long-term future. The Newcastle legend has delivered a scathing assessment of the current state of the club.",
      "And he believes things are so bad at Old Trafford that Amorim could even move on this summer. Shearer insisted that Amorim did not realise the scale of the challenge that was facing him, but admitted United had become 'much worse'.",
      "\"There will be a lot of questions around Ruben Amorim’s future now and very much like the Spurs situation, it wouldn't surprise me if he wasn't the manager at the beginning of the season. Whether that's his choice or not, I guess,\" he told Betfair.",
      "\"I've said it so many times, there's no way he's gone into that football club and expected what he found. There's no way he thought it was that bad. He couldn't have, because I'm not sure you'd go. He hasn't helped the situation.",
      "\"They've actually got so much worse under him. It might have been papering over the cracks if they had won the Europa League, but their problems were summed up in that 97 minutes: no creativity, no legs, no energy, no goals, and a complete mess.\"",
      "Shearer believes that it will be incredibly difficult for United to turn their fortunes around quickly. He made an early predicition that next season will be another campaign without any silverware for the Red Devils.",
      "\"It's a mess at Manchester United. Much like Spurs, their season was this competition. We've been seeing it for the last two or three months that both clubs needed to win this competition to salvage something from their season,\" Shearer added.",
      "\"Financially, it will hurt them to attract the players they wanted because they're not Man United from 20 years ago, where most players wanted to go there. They're not that football club anymore; they're only that club by name.",
      "\"They don't deserve to win the Europa League or be in the Champions League. They've been awful all season in every department. The final basically just summed up their season as a whole: slow, terrible in front of the goal, no threat, no energy, and really poor.",
      "\"Are they going to be in the market for top players now? Top players want to play in the Champions League and challenge for trophies. Are Man United going to be challenging for trophies next season? I think the simple answer is no, they're not.\""

      "Manchester United are at rock bottom following their miserable defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. For the pessimists there is more misery on the horizon, but for the optimists it means the only way is up.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens this summer, with an absolutely crucial transfer window on the horizon. United know they need to make wholesale changes – and that’s why Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire squad at risk of being sold.",
      "Nobody is above the axe of Ratcliffe, who has already made hundreds of United staff redundant and has made it very clear that he’s not motivated by winning popularity contests. The sign has been put into the front lawn: United are clearing out their garage and everyone has a price. Let the bidding commence.",
      "United paid Inter Milan £43million for Onana. He’s coming up to two years as United’s number one and it’s clear that it just hasn’t worked out. His fated ability to play out from the back hasn’t had any tangible benefit and, instead, we’ve been treated to the occasional howler. Yet he is still one of the players who has some sell-on value, so make the most of it. SELL.",
      "Hard to judge the Turkish keeper, who has only played 10 times for United in two seasons. When he has played, like in the 4-1 defeat by Newcastle in April, he didn’t cover himself in glory, making a dreadful error. But, to be brutally honest, United have bigger fish to fry than their second-choice goalkeeper. KEEP.",
      "Look up ‘good man to have around the dressing room’ in the football cliche dictionary and it is likely that Heaton will be cited. But at 39 years old, and with his contract about to expire, the time has come to hang up your boots, Tom. RELEASE.",
      "The Swede has been at United since 2017 and if we’re being brutally honest – which we are – he has never really been good enough to be a mainstay at such a club. With his contract up on June 30, his final act as a United player will be getting a yellow card for shouting at the fourth official in Bilbao. RELEASE.",
      "One of the summer arrivals in Erik ten Hag’s ill-fated final transfer window. A solid if unspectacular defender, who does have the benefit of being able to play in a few positions. Does he have the legs to play as a wingback in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation? I’m not convinced, but we can’t flog everyone. KEEP.",
      "Has had an injury-hit debut campaign with United and looks a long way off the much-hyped Ajax youngster of his heyday. He cost United £42.9m from Bayern Munich in the summer and is a classic example of their poor recruitment. SELL.",
      "I love Maguire. But watching him flail around in the Spurs penalty area, desperately trying to affect the game, while fighting with Cristian Romero, looked a lot like the death knell of a football team. Amorim essentially put the big lad up top and hoped. It is time to move on from Maguire. SELL.",
      "It feels like a long, long time since we were debating whether a 5ft 9in centre-back could hack it in the Greatest League In the World™. The diminutive defender has been out injured for some time, which has the effect of increasing his stock during miserable times like these. KEEP.",
      "Coming to a quiz near you as a pointless answer in about 10 years. SELL.",
      "Signed in January, Dorgu has at times looked like the sort of left wing-back Amorim requires. He has the athleticism to get up and down the wing, a solid left foot and appears to have a pretty high ceiling. KEEP.",
      "United beat Real Madrid to the signing of Yoro, but have been dismayed to see him injured for much of this season. Still only 19 years old, the Frenchman needs to stay injury-free and have some stability around him. KEEP.",
      "Injuries have taken their toll on Shaw, who is United’s longest-serving current player having joined the club way back in 2014. It is crazy that he still has two years left on his deal. Ratcliffe is not afraid of taking tough decisions and getting rid of the England defender is one that needs doing. SELL.",
      "Has been one of the strong performers over the past few seasons and appears to be a good fit for Amorim’s tactical system. Dalot also seems like a leader in the dressing room – and considering I’m getting rid of a lot of them – he is worth keeping. KEEP.",
      "One of few bright lights in a dark, dark season. Heaven was pinched from Arsenal and showed plenty of promise when he played. KEEP.",
      "A veteran player who has been a model professional for United. But he’s 37 years old and out of contract next month. RELEASE.",
      "The young defender has broken into the first team this season and is one of a few players who is flying the flag for the famous United academy. KEEP.",
      "Pre-season will be indicative for Fredricson, who like Amass has got a taste of first-team football. Amorim will know whether he has a shot, but a loan spell might be more appropriate. KEEP.",
      "Judged by numbers only, Mount has been a dreadful buy for £55m. He has four goals and one assist in 45 appearances for United. But, now he’s fit again, he needs to kick on and prove himself as a No.10 in Amorim’s shape. There is absolutely no chance United can sell him, so they better hope he turns up next season. KEEP.",
      "Right then. United’s best player and captain. The source of 19 goals and 19 assists this season. But also a player who has concrete interest from the Saudi Pro League. I would take the gamble and sell up. United need to change their culture and – rightly or wrongly – Fernandes has become the embodiment of their malaise. He will fetch a good price and, considering he turns 31 in September, it could prove smart business in hindsight. The only problem is replacing him without the allure of European football… SELL.",
      "A very very simple decision. Hasn’t been good enough for about two years. A player well past his peak. Thankfully, his contract is up. RELEASE.",
      "The man referenced by Ratcliffe as embodying the wasteful recruitment model of the United of old. The former Real Madrid man is past his best and the image of him running through quicksand, trying to catch up to Spurs players on the break, will stick with me. Off he goes to Saudi Arabia. SELL.",
      "United went through an awful lot of faff to sign Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and didn’t get much for their £50m. However, the Uruguay international cannot be written off yet. He has the right profile to replace Casemiro and should be given the chance to step up. KEEP.",
      "Like everyone else in the squad, Mainoo is up for sale, but really he shouldn’t be. He is a talented young Mancunian who represents a link to the club’s fans. He is a supremely gifted youngster with the ability to develop into a great box-to-box midfielder. He just needs to be managed well and not burdened. KEEP.",
      "I’m not sure that Collyer has the ability to make a mark on United next season. SELL.",
      "The fact he was loaned out to Rotherham in January says a lot. SELL.",
      "I feel sorry for Hojlund. He clearly isn’t a £72m player. He should not be burdened with the goalscoring demands that come with being United’s first-choice No.9. The Dane is too inexperienced for the role he’s inherited. He should either be an understudy to an experienced striker, or sold to sign such a player. Reports in Italy suggest United could flog him back to where he came from. If that doesn’t happen then he can take up the role he should’ve had in the first place. KEEP.",
      "There is no going back from December when Amorim froze him out. He wants a new challenge and should be given it, with his spell on loan at Aston Villa doing his sale value no harm. SELL.",
      "United’s interest in Matheus Cunha is not good news for Zirkee, who is at his best dropping off the back line into space. The difference is Cunha is more talented and has scored a lot more goals this season for Wolves. Zirkzee may still have admirers abroad. United should call them up. SELL.",
      "One of few success stories from a terrible spell of recruitment. The young winger is a joy to watch and, if he hadn’t been injured this season, could have led United to a few more wins (just remember how good that last-minute Manchester Derby winner was). KEEP.",
      "Garnacho strongly hinted at a summer departure in the wake of the defeat by Spurs. He has been linked with Chelsea and Napoli and, to be frank, United should cash in because his end product is severely lacking. He has six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League appearances. Get rid. SELL.",
      "The Brazilian has turned into a different player since joining Real Betis on loan, but it would be foolish to think he would simply bring that form to Old Trafford if United recalled him. It would be much wiser to cut your losses on the £82m Ten Hag flop. SELL.",
      "Wayne Rooney said he felt sorry for Obi when watching him play against Brentford recently, with United showing no idea of how to utilise the youngster. The hope is that, with better team-mates, he can come good. KEEP.",
      "Another tale of waste at United. Sancho cost £73m from Borussia Dortmund but never got close to repaying that fee. He hasn’t done an awful lot on loan at Chelsea, but luckily they have an obligation to buy the winger. SELL."

      "A 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao meant Spurs lifted the Europa League - their first piece of silverware in 17 years - as well as securing a place in next season’s Champions League.",
      "The result helped to salvage a season which has seen Spurs endure their worst domestic season in almost 50 years. Going into the final game of the Premier League season, the North Londoners are 17th in the table, having slumped to a staggering 21 league defeats.",
      "It now remains to be seen whether their European exploits will be enough to convince Daniel Levy that Postecoglou deserves a third season in the Spurs dugout. But the Daily Mail reports that Tottenham ’s players do not expect that to happen, with a change now deemed more likely.",
      "The report adds that alternatives to Postecoglou are already being discussed by Levy, with Fulham boss Marco Silva one of the names in the frame this summer. Brennan Johnson, who was credited with the winning goal over United, suggested that winning the trophy would be the perfect ‘mic drop’ for the manager.",
      "Captain Son Heung-min made it clear that he wants the 59-year-old to stay with the club. He said: “He won the trophy. Nobody else did it, so - look, it’s not up to me or the players, but we just have to look at the facts.",
      "“At the fact that we hadn’t won in 17 years, but this is the day we finally won it. It’s the manager who wins the trophy. So we'll see what’s going to happen.”",
      "Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario echoed Son's impassioned plea for Postecoglou to stay and said: “Yeah, of course. He’s my gaffer. He’s the person who decided to bring me to this club. I just have to be very thankful to him for how much he believed since day one, since he wanted me to sign for the club.",

United have lost more than £370million over the past five years.",

It would have been sacked in the evening, rather than the morning for Erik ten Hag.",

      "But the club's 13th FA Cup triumph was detrimental in the long run. Sir Jim Ratcliffe lost his nerve, kept Ten Hag and United have lost 18 Premier League games already this season. They are assured of a schedule devoid of jaunts across the continent next season.",
      "United's wallets will be hit. There will be a derisory merit payment for what could be a 17th-place finish in the Premier League, no European revenue, no matchday revenue in the Champions League and a penalty clause invoked in the Adidas deal. Roughly, that is an £80million black hole.",
      "They have squandered nearly £15m keeping Erik ten Hag and then hiring and firing Dan Ashworth. There is also the £200m they largely misspent on players in Ten Hag's last transfer window.",
      "2019 was the year of the 'cultural reset' at United. Reset, revamp or reboot, none of those words do United's current position justice. Without relegation (never a tangible threat), they are at rock bottom.",
      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",
      "Here is a five-point plan to make United a force again:",
      "More proactivism, less pragmatism",
      "Amorim has agonised over whether to play pragmatically or proactively. In Bilbao, he did neither. Alejandro Garnacho was benched as Mason Mount retained the faith of a coach who \"loves\" him yet overlooked the fact that the playmaker is not as much of a goal threat as Garnacho. And United did not score for the 16th time.",
      "One of the accusations levelled at Mount is he does little with the ball. Amorim bristled at the suggestion he had got it wrong by starting Mount, reminding this correspondent that Garnacho missed a one-on-one in the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, a match Mount emerged in to end the Spanish side's chances of a comeback.",
      "Mount's fleeting purple patch consisted of three goals in two games and he did not play 90 minutes in either. Garnacho had started 14 successive games until his 'rest' for the defeat against West Ham. That he remained on the bench at Chelsea five days later was significant.",
      "Had Leny Yoro not recovered from a foot injury, Amorim would have started the same side that lost at Chelsea. United were competitive for around an hour at Stamford Bridge when matches last for 90 minutes. They managed one attempt on target. Garnacho forced Guglielmo Vicario to dive down to his left within minutes of his belated arrival on Wednesday night.",
      "United also had glaring issues in midfield against Spurs: full backs as wingers. Noussair Mazraoui admitted last week he is more settled as a right centre back as it is the closest position to playing at right back. Mazraoui is not an attack-minded winger and United offered no threat down Tottenham's left-hand side when they ought to have doubled up on the shaky Destiny Udogie.",
      "Bruno Fernandes seemed to have been reinvented as a central midfielder before the March internationals. Then he moved forward again when United's season resumed at Nottingham Forest. Suddenly, he was back in midfield for the dress rehearsal at Chelsea. Amorim maybe wanted some finesse in midfield against the conservative trio of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr but Fernandes, United's top scorer, had to be in the front three for the final.",
      "Mazraoui should be considered a centre half from next season and United need an upgrade on the right wing. Amorim played wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system at Sporting yet has settled on full backs at United. The ends have not justified the means yet United have already invested £25million in the Danish left back Patrick Dorgu, who started by default in Bilbao.",
      "Compromise with youngsters",
      "Garnacho is becoming a problem for United. Like Marcus Rashford before him, he has developed an inflated air of entitlement and it should startle United that a 20-year-old brazenly sounded off about a \"s**t\" season, criticised the manager's decision to drop him and cast doubt on his future. His gobby brother had also joined in online.",
      "The authority of the United manager's role should always be protected but Garnacho is a nuanced case. There has been a willingness from the player and coach to make it work since he was dropped from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 and Amorim has enthused about the adjustments Garnacho has made to his game.",
      "Garnacho remains one of a handful of fan favourites. He was serenaded when he warmed up at San Mames and there was a bullish roar when he was ordered back to come on. He was seen as such an ally of Amorim's he flanked him for the pre-match press conference for the semi-final second leg against Athletic.",
      "United are renowned for wingers and Garnacho is one of the academy's biggest success stories this century. Only Garnacho jars with Amorim's system and a new number 10, Matheus Cunha, is expected to occupy one of those two roles behind the striker.",
      "There has been interest in Garnacho and there is an obvious temptation for United to cash in. He would represent pure profit, you can't tolerate any player publicly questioning the manager and he does not naturally fit into the system.",
      "Napoli, on the verge of a fourth Scudetto, wanted Garnacho in January and deemed him worthy of replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Antonio Conte, the Napoli coach, oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea. Those are ringing endorsements United should be wary of.",
      "All parties need to sit around a table, thrash out their differences and seek a compromise. That also applies to Kobbie Mainoo, the poster boy of United's future as recently as the start of this season but no longer a regular. Amorim has misgivings about Mainoo as a midfielder and has trialled him as a playmaker and a striker with mixed results.",
      "It would be beyond bold for United to cash in on Mainoo and/or Garnacho when it is not a stretch to imagine them requiring a new manager in the autumn. United can improve with Amorim, Garnacho and Mainoo all on the bus, despite Garnacho's brother claiming he was thrown under it.",
      "Recruit for the club, not the manager",
      "If United fans were given the choice between Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres the majority would opt for the latter. Gyokeres is older and more proven, albeit in a much weaker league, and United know all-too-well the pitfalls of stockpiling players schooled outside one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Gyokeres would be a legitimate exception, yet United have settled on Delap. The dynamic suddenly shifts as the scrutiny would be on Jason Wilcox, rather than Amorim. Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Wilcox possesses \"the best eyes in football\" and he has not looked far for United's next starting striker, having watched Delap develop at City when he was the head of their academy.",
      "United's recruitment will be severely impacted by the absence of European football from their schedule next season. Cunha and Delap are attainable through release clauses. That feels like a cop-out with Delap, only four days younger than the dismal Rasmus Hojlund. They have a -12 goal difference. They cannot cut corners with the striker's role.",
      "Last year, United operated by a one for the manager, one for the board policy. Ten Hag reunited with Ajax alumni but also integrated two signings from the French league with no links to Dutch football. Leny Yoro should have ushered in a very different recruitment era at United, only their next arrival was the Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The mid-season signings of Dorgu and Ayden Heaven have offered a glimpse of what could come this summer and beyond. But the worst United side in 51 years needs proven commodities, particularly if Bruno Fernandes heads for the Riyadh retirement home.",
      "Expendable culture",
      "United are bound to be saddled with some immovable players. Luke Shaw was raw in the San Mames mixed zone, questioning if he is good enough. We all know the answer and he should, too. He is not going to put his own contract through the shredder two years before its expiry date.",
      "Nobody should be off-limits if United receive an acceptable offer. How could they be after a season like this one? That applies to Garnacho and Mainoo. If they want a change of scenery then that is the clincher.",
      "Jose Mourinho was standing in the doorway when he spoke to some of us in San Jose in 2018 and said he would not stand in the way of Anthony Martial, who wanted to leave. But Ed Woodward did. Ratcliffe was still cursing Woodward's methods as recently as March. United have let innumerable players outstay their welcome and Martial was one of them. Shaw is another. Victor Lindelof, too.",
      "The profitability and sustainability rules have influenced the length of contracts but United have got to stop doling out five-year deals like a volunteer with leaflets on Deansgate. Shorter contracts would keep players on their toes. Amorim's deal only has two years left to run and he will be judged much sooner than 2027.",
      "A new fall-guy at hierarchical level",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford sunk his claws into Ratcliffe a while ago and Ratcliffe is quite taken by him. Two years after the Ineos delegation visited Old Trafford, nobody has given a satisfactory explanation for Brailsford's presence on the United football board.",
      "Brailsford has admitted he is \"no expert in football\". You can see that from United's results since he started to have input on their performance. Brailsford was an ally of Ashworth's. United spent longer courting Ashworth than the five months he lasted at United.",
      "Ratcliffe should send Brailsford on his bike. That would show Ineos are serious about arresting United's staggering decline."

      "Delap, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, has excelled in his first full season as a Premier League player, scoring 12 goals for the relegated Tractor Boys.",
      "As a result of suffering an immediate return to the Championship, the £30million release clause in Delap's contract will become active this summer. Ipswich will conclude their first Premier League campaign in more than 20 years against West Ham United on Sunday.",
      "\"He's looking at his options for next year,\" McKenna told the media on Friday lunchtime. \"We support him with that.",

      "Delap, who will turn 23 next February, has been a beacon of light in a season of struggle for Ipswich, who will have ambitions of bouncing straight back to the Premier League at the first attempt next season.",

      "Before Wednesday's Europa League final, Manchester United would have had a Plan A and a Plan B for this summer. The binmen in Bilbao might find the more expressive shopping list discarded somewhere in the days to come.",
      "United have sought to downplay the impact the loss of that cash will have on their summer transfer plans, and they continue to press ahead with attempts to sign Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. But for a club that has sacked 400 members of its workforce and made a series of penny-pinching measures, it's pretty obvious the financial effect of defeat to Tottenham will be seismic.",
      "But those two plans should cover departures as well as arrivals, and with no European football next season, Ineos can now take a bludgeon to this squad. United could have 31 first-team squad members when players return for pre-season and in a campaign that could be as short as 40 games, that is wildly excessive.",
      "A 25-man squad for next season would be fine, but only if that included some of the club's promising youngsters who are on the fringes of the first team. Any bigger, and there will be senior players barely getting a kick, and the dynamic at training will be difficult to manage for Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to make the most of those free weeks at Carrington.",
      "Some of the departures are straightforward. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are out of contract and will leave next month. Tyrell Malacia, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all out on loan and will be sold in the summer. That is seven players going already.",
      "Then are the potential sales. Change looks certain in the goalkeeping department, and Altay Bayindir should be sold for an upgrade to offer more competition to Andre Onana.",
      "The departures of Evans and Lindelof free up space in defence for Ayden Heaven, and no further sales are really required here, although the wing-back situation is one to monitor. Diogo Dalot needs competition on the right, and having Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass on the left looks light, but there might be no other option.",
      "Sales should be considered in midfield. The failure to qualify for the Champions League makes Casemiro's role redundant next season. He is a European specialist who has struggled in the Premier League, and Ineos desperately need shot of the club's highest earner. Manuel Ugarte doesn't look up to the job yet, but will get another season. Toby Collyer turns 22 in January and either needs more games or to be sold as well, as there are a crop of promising midfielders in the academy waiting for their chance.",
      "In attack, selling or at least loaning one of Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund looks essential. Neither are up to the job, but Zirkzee has probably shown more promise. He is less of a natural fit as a No. 9 for Amorim, but his versatility to play behind a striker is beneficial. If Amorim keeps Chido Obi in the first-team picture, he is another option at centre-forward.",
      "Then there are the two most controversial possible departures. Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would have both been frustrated at their roles in the Europa League final and it's clear Amorim is yet to fully trust either. As academy graduates, they represent pure profit in the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) and are sellable assets.",
      "A departure for either would go down badly amongst supporters, but neither is in Amorim's strongest team, and it would be a major financial boost. Without the guarantee of what would have been at least 10 extra fixtures in the Champions League, keeping both of them happy might be a challenge as well.",
      "That is the context with which United must approach this summer. Defeat in Bilbao means they have to be ruthless when it comes to trimming the size of this squad."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, May 23.",
      "The dust is beginning to settle on the disappointing Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and with the final match of the Premier League campaign this Sunday, attention is beginning to turn to the summer. United will be eyeing a major rebuild in the transfer window and which players stay, go or arrive will be interesting to see.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho looks more likely to leave than stay at the present moment following his outspoken comments after the Europa League final. Napoli had a bid rejected for his services in the January transfer window.",
      "Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha is seen as a top target for United and the first deal which is likely to be completed this summer. The Wolverhampton Wanderers man has a £62.5m release clause.",
      "Meanwhile, Liam Delap is believed to have held talks in Manchester this week over a move to the club this summer. Chelsea and Newcastle are also thought to be keen on the Ipswich Town man.",
      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "It is Sports Illustrated's belief that Ruben Amorim has been set a definitive transfer budget now that the Europa League is overwith.",
      "They say that the manager will have £100m to play with if he is going to rebuild areas of his squad for the 2025/26 campaign. Any additional funds must be raised through player sales.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Ruben Amorim has signed off his approval on Manchester United buying Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace.",
      "The FA Cup-winning midfielder is wanted for his 'pace, power and athleticism', as per ESPN's earlier report about players who will be targeted, but there is apparently going to be competition from Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "He claims that the Man United captain's camp have been in touch and are waiting on an 'improved' offer, though what is already on the table is not far away from what is desired.",
      "Via The Express & Star, Wolves manager Vitor Pereira has remained coy this afternoon over which players of his will leave this summer amid Manchester United interest in forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"To be honest, I don't know the players that will leave. I'm waiting to understand, I really don't know. At home in front of our supporters is a good time to thank them for their support, they've helped us a lot,\" the told the press.",
      "It was added: \"We need to start work and get a clear picture on the squad. If we lose players with quality, we must replace them because we want to be better next season.\"",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, via Caught Offside, Delap has already held talks with both Chelsea and United about a possible summer transfer.",
      "The Blues could have the advantage over United due to their guaranteed European participation next season.",
      "However, it is also claimed that interest could be arriving from Germany for Delap with several 'important' Bundesliga clubs interested in the Englishman.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are looking to make Cunha their first transfer of the summer.",
      "With a £62.5m release clause in his contract that the Reds are willing to activate, a deal could be finalised quickly.",
      "Due to the Club World Cup, the transfer window opens briefly on June 1 so United could have Cunha officially in the building by then.",
      "In the January transfer window, United were linked with a move for Christopher Nkunku on loan as they looked to strengthen their attack.",
      "Obviously, that move never came to pass but Fabrizio Romano reports today that Nkunku remains guaranteed to leave Chelsea at the end of this season.",
      "Contact with the Frenchman is set to start soon and interested clubs have been lurking since January for him.",
      "Earlier this year, it was reported that Rashford saw a move to Barcelona as the dream heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport understands that while Villa have a £40m option to buy clause for Rashford in the summer, this does not mean that they have first refusal on the winger.",
      "Therefore, Rashford does have the option to explore a move to Barcelona before entering talks with Villa.",
      "Speaking on Catalan radio station RAC 1, as quoted by TEAMtalk, Barcelona sporting director Deco has confirmed that his club do have an interest in Rashford heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "The former Chelsea man explained:",
      "We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players. Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.",
      "According to ESPN, Amorim will demand that United look to bring in players that possess pace and strength in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed the Portuguese was fearful before the Europa League final that his team lacked these characteristics and this would ultimately cost them.",
      "Midfield is seen as a key are to improve after deals for Cunha and Delap are approved or otherwise.",
      "Despite Fernandes admitting that he will leave if United want him to in the summer, it appears there are no suggestions that the club want that to happen.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, Al Hilal see Fernandes as a priority for the summer transfer window and they would love to sign him before the Club World Cup kicks off next month.",
      "However, no direct approach to United has been made at this stage and, as far as the club sees it, they do not want to lose their captain.",
      "Amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes has admitted that United may try to cash in on him in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed that Al Hilal would be willing to pay £120m for his services and if such a bid was to come in, United may find it difficult to reject it.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the full-time whistle in Bilbao, Fernandes said:",
      "I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go. I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "United have been reassured that the deal to sign Cunha will not be cancelled despite missing out on Champions League football next season.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano told GiveMeSport that the deal to sign the Wolves man is still set to go through soon.",
      "United already told Matheus Cunha that they are prepared to trigger the clause, so there will be no issues. And so I think it's going to be the first signing of the summer for United. And it's important to say that the player wanted this move, regardless of Champions League football or not, regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. Cunha wants to play for Manchester United, and my understanding is that he will play for Manchester United.",
      "I fear with him that we will end up selling him for £50m-£60m for PSR reasons, possibly this summer - it has been rumoured hasn't it. I fear he might go somewhere else, he might play in a 4-3-3 and he will end up scoring 25 or 30 goals for somebody. That is how good I think this lad could be. Shoehorn him into this system and I think it might be an issue because I am not sure he can play wing-back. I am not sure he is clever enough to be in that No.10 role, I am struggling to find a position for him in this system.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Napoli are prepping a bid to sign Garnacho this summer having missed out on him in January.",
      "United rejected an offer in the region of £40m this winter but could be more open to selling at the end of the season with more time available to find a replacement.",
      "It is believed the Italians are preparing a £50m package for Garnacho and while United want £60m, the two teams are not too far away in their negotiations.",
      "Before the Europa League final, Garnacho shared an image of himself scoring in the last final he played in - the FA Cup against Manchester City.",
      "After the final whistle in Bilbao and with just 20 minutes to his name on Wednesday night, he struck back in his post-match interview.",
      "Obviously, it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.",

      "After an abysmal Premier League campaign, which could end with them 17th, United fell at the final hurdle in the Europa League. Despite his side laying no punches onto Spurs, Amorim didn't change his team until the 71st minute with Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho coming on for the two players they probably should have started over in Rasmus Hojlund and Mount.",
      "Much has been made of Garnacho's snub. The winger has publicly come out and seemingly questioned the decision for him to only get 20 minutes while his brother has also criticised the handling of him in the final by Amorim.",

      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",
      "A football finance expert has said Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night means they will miss out on around £85million in additional revenue.",
      "Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, has outlined just how costly United's failure to get back into the Champions League will be. \"Having lost the Europa League, Manchester United have probably missed out on something between £10m to £15m in direct prize money,\" Wilson told Genting Casino.",
      "\"That was made up of around £4m for winning the final, somewhere between £3m and £5m from an increased UEFA coefficient share. Then there's elements around commercial bonuses, appearance fees, match day revenues that they would have benefited from. What we then need to remember of course is that there will also be an offset there.",
      "\"So they won't have bonus payments to pay, for instance, for their player wages. So that's quite an important factor to include. The qualification that they've missed out on in the Champions League has cost them around £85m of additional revenue. That revenue is due to broadcast, gate receipts and some of those UEFA payments.",
      "\"The fact that the club has missed out on that revenue is quite a blow to their budget line and will affect what they're able to do in the transfer market this summer, not just from an amount of cash perspective and what they can spend on transfers but also the type of players they can attract as a result of having no European football given their league position.\"",
      "The club is reportedly aware of the conditions required to trigger the clause. However, there has been no 'direct contact' between the clubs so far, though those formalities are expected to happen once the season ends.",

      "Sean Dyche has suggested he would win more games as Manchester United boss than Ruben Amorim, so for a bit of fun, we looked at what could happen if Dyche and his 4-4-2 tactics made their way to the Old Trafford dugout next season?",
      "Amorim has struggled at United since he joined the club in November, with the Portuguese manager leading United to just six wins in the Premier League since his arrival. And now, after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham, it's confirmed that United will not play European football for the upcoming campaign.",
      "Being 16th in the Premier League with one game to go and no European football has put pressure on Amorim, and speaking recently on the Stick to Football podcast, former Everton and Burnley manager Dyche has thrown his hat in the ring, suggesting he could do a better job at United than Amorim.",
      "On the podcast, Dyche said: \"I reckon if I went there and played my way, we'd win more games. Just 4-4-2 – give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don't have to over-teach everyone.\"",
      "So, if Dyche and his synonymous 4-4-2 tactics were to take over at United for the 2025/26 season, could he do a better job than Amorim? For a bit of fun, let's take a look...",
      "To set up this simulation, we used Football Manager 2024 to sack Amorim in the summer before appointing Dyche as the new United head coach. We then simulated the 2025/26 season, and this is how the Englishman performed in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "In the summer, not many big signings were made, with the biggest being Liam Delap from Ipswich Town. Of course, Dyche's first order of business was to shake up the tactics, with 4-4-2 becoming the norm. Dyche reintegrated Marcus Rashford to his squad as a striker, while Mason Mount was one of his favourites, predominantly as a left midfielder.",
      "At the end of the 2025/26 season, Football Manager 2024 put together an overall best Man United XI, based on performances, statistics, and other metrics. This is what it looked like:",
      "Full United best XI: (4-4-2): Onana; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Shaw; Amad, Mainoo, Fernandes, Mount; Zirkzee, Rashford.",
      "United didn't suffer many injury problems during the 2025/26 season, with the likes of Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Amad Diallo all staying fit to make the best XI. Delap missed out on the best XI despite scoring 15 goals for the club, with Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee the duo used the most up front.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund saw little game time under Dyche, with the striker scoring two goals as he made just four starts all season. Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes were the two best midfielders at the club during the simulation, but Manuel Ugarte did feature more than Mainoo, with the two rotating regularly.",
      "With no European football, United could put a big focus on the Premier League, and at the end of the season, big improvements had been made as they managed to return to Europe for the following campaign.",
      "Not exactly Champions League, but Dyche led his side to a much better league finish than the previous season, with United finishing eighth to earn a place in the Conference League. 13 wins, 12 draws and 13 losses saw them end the season on 51 points, eight fewer than Brighton in seventh and only ahead of Aston Villa and Bournemouth on goal difference.",
      "United failed to pick up a win in their final seven games of the season, which saw them drop out of the Europa League spots and settle for the Conference League. In the FA Cup, Dyche's side were knocked out in the fourth round following a 3-1 defeat away to West Ham United, while their Carabao Cup run concluded in the semi-finals after losing 4-3 on aggregate to Arsenal."

      "After a wretched Premier League campaign, both Spurs and United were desperate to seal a backdoor route into next season's Champions League to compete with Europe's elite and boost their respective finances.",
      "United desperately needed Champions League qualification to increase head coach Ruben Amorim's transfer budget to make the rebuild he plans to oversee this summer that little bit easier.",
      "Instead, United are likely to find the transfer market harder to navigate, with their revenue streams impacted as a result of failing to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. It means they will have to be shrew with their recruitment, both in terms of incomings and outgoings.",
      "United are planning for the number of departures to reach double figures this summer, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, each of whom are currently out on loan, being identified as priority sales. The likes of Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are poised to be released when their contracts expire.",
      "However, United, to boost their transfer kitty, could be forced into making some ruthless decisions. Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, who both started the Europa League final on the bench, could be sold.",
      "But despite Fernandes' declaration that he will go if United need to sell him, chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about United's recruitment plans earlier this year suggest that will not be the case, unless, of course, an offer comes along that is too good to turn down.",
      "\"So just because we'll have more revenues to invest if we're in the Champions League, it doesn't mean we're going to go and over-invest,\" he said, speaking at the unveiling of United's new stadium plans in March. \"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment.",
      "\"And also when it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons.\"",

      "The United captain, who is reportedly of interest to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, has been a beacon of light in a dark and miserable season for the Reds. His goals in the Premier League have directly earned United five points and he finished the Europa League campaign as the competition's joint-top leading goalscorer with seven.",
      "Of course, if a mega-money offer is submitted that United simply cannot afford to turn down, then they must consider it for a player who will turn 31 later this year. But unless that happens, his importance to the team is more valuable than a financial offer that is unlikely to be enough to replace Fernandes with a player of equal quality.",
      "Both Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim have already waxed lyrical about Fernandes, outlining his importance and brilliance, meaning an exit is highly unlikely.",
      "And with Berrada already stating that decisions on outgoing players will rest on their importance to the team and not financial reasons, United should not be planning to let their captain go."

      "In the medium to long term, in losing out to Spurs in the showpiece final at Athletic Bilbao’s Estadio de San Mames, United now have no European football whatsoever to look forward to next season, with the high-stakes nature of the game this week seeing the winners book UEFA Champions League qualification for next season, and with it a revenue boost, even at a conservative estimate and without factoring in progression to the knockout stages, of some £70m.",
      "Add in a further £17m or so for the additional matchday revenue that they will miss out on and it becomes even more of a bitter pill to swallow for the club.",
      "As a publicly listed business on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), it’s far easier to take a temperature check as to how the markets feel about the club's performance on the pitch, which is closely linked to how well they do off it.",
      "When the bell sounded the day after the club’s defeat, and with it a lack of Champions League football, shares on the NYSE slumped by 7.8%.",
      "Shares in the club were trading at $13.40 on Thursday when the markets opened, a sum that was even below the $14 per share that existed at the time of the company’s initial public offering back in 2012. As of Friday morning they were trading at $13.29 per share.",
      "To look at the share slump against the value per share that Manchester United co-owner and the club’s second largest shareholder, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, paid when he took a 27.7% stake in the team back in December of 2023, he paid $33 per share for the stake held by his company, INEOS, a deal that had seen the club valued at $5.4bn (£4bn).",
      "That valuation of the club has been continuously challenged through heavy losses creating financial constraints, the redundancies affecting some 250 staff over the past 12 months, and a dismal performance on the pitch that has now seen them without a lucrative European football revenue stream for next season, something that can impact the club’s commercial performance and ability to attract better players to improve their situation.",
      "A recent report from US sports business website Sportico pegged Manchester United’s 2025 valuation at $6.1bn (£4.52bn). While that represented a rise in valuation compared to what Ratcliffe paid, it was down 2% compared to the 2024 list.",
      "The $13.4 per share that was being traded on Thursday implied a market capitalisation of $2.3bn of the football club, although only the A shares, which carry inferior voting rights privileges, trade on the NYSE.",
      "There was optimism from investors ahead of the Ratcliffe deal in late 2023, with shares trading at around $20.38 late in December. But since then there has been a major slump and the share price has shown little sign of rising by any significant percentage in the last 18 months."

      "The dust is beginning to settle on Manchester United's defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "United's season revolved around winning the Europa League for a few months and they stumbled to a 1-0 defeat at the Estadio de San Mames after a first-half goal from Brennan Johnson.",
      "The defeat means there will be no Champions League football at Old Trafford for a successive season. United have endured their worst campaign for 51 years, and Ruben Amorim has promised to quit without receiving any compensation if the United hierarchy feel he is no longer good enough to be their coach.",
      "However, Amorim is understood to still have the board's backing and he is set to remain in charge for next season, which means he must be supported in the summer transfer window.",
      "There are supporters who have questioned whether Amorim is the right coach to take the club forward, though, especially ahead of what will be a crucial transfer window.",
      "United cannot afford any mistakes in the transfer market this summer, but would persisting with Amorim be a mistake? Here are the arguments for and against sacking Amorim:",
      "Against: Amorim inherited the squad",
      "Can Amorim be judged fairly when he inherited a squad that was assembled by his predecessors? Erik ten Hag spent over £400million during his tenure and left behind practically nothing to show for it.",
      "United spent £108.5m on two strikers who struggle to score goals. Amorim has gone from working with Viktor Gyökeres, one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe, to coaching Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who have scored just 17 goals between them in all competitions this term.",
      "For comparison, Gyökeres has netted 53 goals for Sporting Lisbon this season and Amorim was dealt an impossible task when he agreed to take over a side with no natural goalscorer.",
      "The dressing room needs to be gutted. The majority of the players are not good enough to represent the club following an utterly joyless campaign.",
      "Of course, he needs to improve the players he inherited - that is part of his remit - but you can't make a concrete judgement on Amorim when he inherited a mess of a squad.",
      "For: the Premier League campaign",
      "There is no getting away from the disastrous Premier League campaign. United have been shocking and they will record their lowest points total in the Premier League era.",
      "Wherever you look, the league statistics make for grim reading. Amorim has won just 24 points in 26 games, averaging a 0.92 points per game. United last beat a team that wasn't relegated on January 26.",
      "Amorim's points ratio is even lower than Paul Jewell's 0.94-per-game average during Derby County's infamous 2007/08 campaign, when the Rams set the top-flight's lowest ever points total.",
      "Since Amorim's appointment in November, United have been beaten by Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost a record 18 games in the league and have a goal difference of -12.",
      "The team's focus shifted to the Europa League in February, but the lifeless performances in the league haven't been acceptable and Amorim must hit the ground running next season.",
      "Against: an impressive communicator",
      "Amorim has shown himself to be an impressive communicator in press conferences and interviews, which has helped his reputation among fans, who haven't turned against him.",
      "\"We'll back him from the Stretford End,\" has continued to be chanted to the tune of Bonnie Tyler's hit It's a Heartache despite the awful results, and the way Amorim has communicated has helped his cause.",
      "Amorim is convinced he knows what needs to be done to turn the club around and he is articulate when he speaks to journalists. More importantly, the players seem convinced in his plan, as Bruno Fernandes, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot all backed him after the Europa League final.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, Shaw said: \"I think there's a lot of things that need to be changed. I think that's why Ruben is 100% the right person.",
      "\"He knows and he can see day in and day out at the club, not just on the pitch but off the pitch, around the club. The standards, the mindset, like I said, I think he sees everything. I think he knows what he needs to change.\"",
      "Shaw will not decide Amorim's future, but those quotes were strongly in favour of the 40-year-old.",
      "For: formation concerns",
      "United are at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Champions League again. The financial picture at Old Trafford is pretty bleak and the kitty is close to running dry, if you believe Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "That's why this summer is so important. It could be a make-or-break window that decides the club's trajectory for the next five years and United must be sure they have the right coach.",
      "So is Amorim's formation the final 'game model' for Ineos' decision-makers? They must decide whether 3-4-2-1 will be the team's set-up over the next few years because that would ease concerns about backing a manager this summer who insists on playing said system.",
      "It would be a disaster to back Amorim and sign players for his formation this summer, only to sack him a few months into the season and appoint a manager who plays a different system.",
      "The academy teams currently don't play in Amorim's formation and United need to decide on their preferred style. Is this how they want United to play?",
      "Crystal Palace won the FA Cup and Inter Milan are in the Champions League final. They both play with a back-three and show the system can be successful with the right players.",
      "But there are concerns about whether United are settled on the formation and it would be a spectacular mistake to buy players who are tailor-made for Amorim and then to sack him.",
      "For: Europa League final defeat",
      "Considering United gambled everything on the Europa League final in Bilbao, a better performance was expected. United were awful against Tottenham and produced a shameful display.",
      "United struggled to lay a glove on one of the worst Tottenham sides in recent history, and they looked like the club that hadn't won a trophy since 2008. To lose a European final, against a club who are notorious for losing their bottle when it matters, in that manner was appalling and Amorim got a lot of decisions wrong.",
      "The starting XI was wrong, Amorim's tactics were wrong and his hesitation to make substitutions in the second half when the game was getting away from United didn't make sense.",
      "United did not go down fighting and never looked like equalising in the final minutes of the contest.",
      "Amorim's in-game management was lauded when he arrived from Sporting, but he failed to recognise his team selection was wrong and waited too long to introduce fresh legs.",
      "Against: lack of alternatives",
      "Earlier in the season, the thought process with Ten Hag was that he shouldn't be kept solely because there was a lack of alternatives. There was enough evidence to suggest Ten Hag needed to be sacked regardless, but Amorim's situation has not reached that stage.",
      "There is not an overwhelming body of evidence to overlook the lack of alternatives - the likes of Jose Mourinho, Kieran McKenna, Gareth Southgate, Xavi, Thomas Frank and Marco Silva - and sack Amorim.",
      "Could another coach have done a better job than Amorim this season? Probably, but that doesn't necessarily mean a change should be made this summer after just seven months.",
      "Against: trust in the academy",
      "Having a connection with the academy and trusting young players hardly matters when you're 16th in the Premier League, but Amorim does appear to understand the club's tradition.",
      "Although the promotion of some academy players to the first team has been enforced due to injuries, it has been encouraging to see Amorim give prospects the chance to be involved.",
      "It is obviously better to have a coach who is keen to give United's youngsters a chance."

      "However, Brennan Johnson netted the only goal of the game to ensure Spurs secured the Champions League place reserved for the Europa League winners, leaving United to reflect on what could have been. It means Amorim's side will have to concentrate on the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup next term.",
      "Although it might not seem like it at this moment in time, being without European football next term could be beneficial to United and Amorim, who said ahead of the final that he and his team \"need more time\" on the training ground to improve United's fortunes.",
      "\"We need more time with the team,\" Amorim declared, speaking last week. \"We need to arrange a lot of things in Carrington that we need more time to not think game by game by game.",
      "\"And then we have the squad. We proved this year we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive during the Premier League it's going to be tough. So my feeling is that.\"",
      "As a result of failing to qualify for Europe, United's schedule will be reduced by a minimum of eight games next season. As a result of the extra time on the training ground that will generate, Amorim has already accepted his side's domestic form will have to be faultless.",
      "He added: \"For sure, if we don't win [against Spurs]. But I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"It's going to be really bad. I don't want to use that as an excuse, it's going to be really tough. The patience of the fans and you guys, the patience for next season and the limit will have to be perfect.\"",
      "A few days earlier, Amorim had issued a scathing assessment of his side's struggles following a 2-0 defeat to West Ham United at Old Trafford, where he admitted that he was unsure if playing in the Champions League next season would be beneficial.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final, it's by far the smallest problem in our club,\" the United boss admitted. \"We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing in the end of the season, playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon. We need to know that and I'm not concerned about the final. They will be focused.",
      "\"I don't know what is best. If it's playing Champions League or not.\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres says there are \"no hard feelings\" between him and Ruben Amorim, following the manager's \"sad\" decision to leave Sporting CP mid-season to join Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres has been flying high for the Portuguese team this campaign, scoring 53 goals and assisting 13 times in all competitions. These stats, which include 39 goals in Liga Portugal, helped Sporting CP retain their title and also earned him the top scorer gong for the second year running.",
      "The Swede is a sought-after asset for plenty of European teams, including many in the Premier League. United are reportedly in the running for Gyokeres, but will have to fend off strong interest from Arsenal to secure his signature, with the Gunners reportedly in pole position to snap him up.",
      "However, Gyokeres' ex-manager Amorim is currently leading the Red Devils in the Premier League, and their previous bond may convince the prolific goalscorer to snub other higher-ranked clubs to reunite with his fellow countryman at Old Trafford.",
      "In a recent interview with SIC, the 26-year-old admitted the sadness the squad felt losing Amorim mid-season, but said that nobody harboured any resentment towards the young manager for swapping the Jose Alvalade for Old Trafford.",
      "He said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Before Amorim's exit, Sporting were enjoying something of an invincible season, having won every league game before his November exit.",
      "Reflecting on his former manager's winning mentality, Gyokeres added: \"I think when you're in that kind of moment where you keep winning, you go in with the same mentality as every game and you keep doing the same things and with the same rhythm.",
      "\"That's what we felt when we went into the games. It's possible to have those kinds of moments, I don't know if we would have kept the same level throughout the season, because I think it's very normal in football for there to be stages of the season when you maybe win every game and then there's a period when it's tougher.",
      "\"Of course, we always have the mentality of wanting to win every game, but as we've seen in football, it doesn't always end that way. I think it's very difficult to go through an entire season without losing a single game, as you can see in history, I don't think many teams have done it. It's one thing to win a lot of games and another thing to go a whole season without losing a game.\"",
      "Should United make a move for Gyokeres this summer, it wouldn't necessarily break the bank. There is a gentleman's agreement in the Swede's contract that, in theory, would allow him to depart for a fee ranging from £55million to £60m - significantly less than his £84.3m (€100m) release clause.",
      "However, United's damning defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final could put a spanner in Amorim's plans to reunite with his former forward.",
      "The 1-0 loss to Spurs means that the Red Devils will be without European football in the 2025/26 season, making several other clubs more desirable than.",
      "Gyokeres has so far been coy about his plans for the future. \"Hopefully, you can expect that I will keep improving and score goals,\" he said. \"In Portugal? Let's see, it's the future, and it's football as well, so you never know what's going to happen. As you've seen this season, you never know what's going to happen, and it's the same now. We will see in the future.\""

      "As well as United jumping above the Merseysiders in the Match of the Day host's view, he also believes the two La Liga giants are bigger than Liverpool. The Spanish powerhouses have delivered several blows to Liverpool, with Los Blancos beating them in two Champions League finals since 2018, and the Catalans signing many of their best players.",
      "Barcelona enticed Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho and Javier Mascherano to the Camp Nou, while Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to join Real Madrid, having already confirmed that he will be leaving Anfield when his contract expires this summer. Despite the fact Liverpool's record of winning major European titles is only bested by Madrid and AC Milan, Lineker holds Los Blancos, United and Barcelona in greater light than the Merseysiders.",
      "Real Madrid boast 15 Champions League and European Cup trophies, yet Liverpool edges Barcelona with their six major European triumphs against the Catalans' five. The Merseysiders have also lifted the big-eared European trophy more times than United, who have won it three times.",
      "While speaking to La Liga TV in 2023, he said: \"I think in the world's big three football clubs, it's probably Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United in terms of stature. We all know Real Madrid is a proper football club.",
      "\"I'm biased towards Barcelona [as a former player], we don't love Real Madrid in Barcelona to put it mildly. But they are a sensational football club and an incredibly successful football club that play brilliant football.\"",

He was initially planning to continue with live FA Cup broadcasts and World Cup coverage until 2026, but has since chosen to leave the BBC entirely after this weekend's programme.",
      "The departure follows the controversial social media video he shared about Zionism, which featured a rat emoji. Lineker insists he did not see the rat emoji, but admitted he should have paid more due diligence, before sharing the post to his large social media following.",
      "In a video statement he uploaded to his social pages, he said: \"Hi everyone, some personal news. Last week I shared a post here on Instagram that contained an emoji that has awful connotations.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I did not see the emoji. If I had, I would never, ever have shared it. The minute I was made aware, I quickly deleted the post and went on to make an apology.",
      "\"I would like once again to say I'm sorry unreservedly for the hurt and the upset caused. It was a genuine mistake and oversight, but I should have been more diligent. I know that.",
      "\"Football has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember - both on the pitch and in the studio. I care deeply about the game, and about the work I've done with the BBC over many years.",
      "\"As I've said, I would never consciously repost anything anti-semitic - it goes against everything I stand for. However, I recognise the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\""

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly set to demand that the club prioritise pace and strength in the summer transfer window to compete in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's men will be without European football next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night.",
      "While the lack of Champions League is a huge blow for the Reds, the focus solely on domestic football could offer them a chance to significantly improve their position in English football.",
      "To do this, it is largely agreed that Amorim will need to oversee a major rebuild of this squad. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha is the top target for the Reds and he is reportedly set to arrive first at Carrington.",
      "Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is also at the top of the list for United and both signings can be made without the need to sell players. However, beyond that point, United will need to rely on selling the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony to help boost Amorim's budget.",
      "According to ESPN, if United do manage to make those sales, Amorim has a clear vision for how the new recruits should look. It is believed that the Portuguese head coach has noticed United's inability to compete physically against Premier League teams this season.",
      "The report claims that before the Europa League final, Amorim was concerned that United could be outmuscled by Spurs in the midfield particularly. With those concerns met, Amorim is keen for that not to be the case again next season.",
      "Central midfield recruits will likely be needed in the summer with Christian Eriksen set to depart and Casemiro's future still unclear.",

I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.\" The Portuguese star arrived in January 2020, and he's been United's star consistent performer, repeatedly rescuing results when the rest of the team has underperformed, but he wasn't able to do the same in Bilbao.",
      "Fernandes added: \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Still hurting from the loss, some fans think the end is near for Fernandes too. Reader SimplyRed60 says: \"Sell Bruno while we can get a decent fee. He's never been the captain we need. Yes, he has shone when all around him has been dire, but we need a complete rebuild - culture and style. And for that we need fresh blood after a mass clear out. The challenge is however, we need a manager to start that rebuild and sadly (as he seems like a genuine guy) that's not Amorim.\"",
      "Commenter Backdraft writes: \"You need your big players to be taking the game by the scruff of the neck and he didn't do it last night. Complained about every decision and even berated his own players when he made one of countless misplaced passes. He is not a leader, nor is he even a Cantona.",
      "\"I will give a comparison of what a leader is. Keane in '99 in Juventus. We are two down and he is booked and will miss the final. He dragged that team back into the game and pulled us over the line. Time to cash in.\"",
      "RedIsRed says: \"Every player must have this attitude. Collectively they have delivered the worst season in the memory of a huge chunk of United fans. We can question coaching and tactics but there were at least a dozen games they could have won with just pride and determination. Last night showed us we don't have a hero. Bruno is probably the best of a bad lot but not a hero. He won't hurt us if stays but might help us if he goes. Money talks.\"",
      "Rickster 10 writes: \"I think Bruno's time at United has run it's course. If there's silly money being offered for him, take it. When things in a game are not going his way, he becomes anonymous. We've known since Amorim came in a rebuild is required. Give him the chance to do it.\"",
      "Not everyone feels the same way. Utd4me says: \"If Bruno leaves we are done for, he's been United's best player and his goals are the only thing that's prevented them from being relegated this season. Championship football incoming if he doesn't stay.\"",
      "Reader Steviweavi agrees: \"If they allow Bruno to leave, we'll be like this for another decade.\" TT84 adds: \"Let's be honest, we won't get £100m for him. As good as he is, his age is against him. Are we really prepared to lose a player who brings what he brings, and for what? We will have enough money for a forward. That will make a dent into how we do going forward.\"",
      "Rickba writes: \"It's not easy to find such talented players as Bruno. Our best player this season. Can't imagine where we would be without him. Why sell our best player? Don't forget how many times he has won us games this season. It would be a travesty to sell him, then having to find a player with Bruno's talent.\"",

Amorim promised that \"if the board and fans feel that I’m not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation\".",
      "In a season of daft decisions at United, Amorim has got in on the act. Shaw in and Garnacho out against Tottenham. Flogging a dead horse in Rasmus Hojlund and like-for-like substitutions. Amorim does not get a free pass in this apocalyptic season.",
      "The United fans stopped singing their Amorim chant in the second half. Nothing quite drains matchgoers of a belief that glory days will return like losing a final to Tottenham. United's end drained quicker than a bathtub.",
      "Amorim is unnervingly honest and he is now practically daring United to dispense of him. Amorim's reputation is not intact though not in tatters, either.",
      "He is not the biggest problem at United. The Glazers are immovable yet they have relinquished control of football operations to Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford.",

      "United's worst season in 51 years has to be viewed as an opportunity, a blessing in disguise. Clear the decks. Purge the squad. Send Brailsford on his bike.",
      "Shaw has been at United for 11 years next month. He questioned afterwards if he was good enough for United. He isn't. He is too injury-prone, too unreliable and, given his years at the club, too long in the tooth.",

      "Fernandes has been a brilliant player and is one to keep, but he is not untouchable. He symbolises the team: something out of nothing, hit-and-hope. Fernandes has been involved in three of United's worst campaigns in living memory.",

      "United have to shift Shaw. He has arguably outstayed his welcome by seven years. Jose Mourinho wanted to jettison him in 2018 and was overruled. United have never truly recovered from that summer where Ed Woodward undermined the United manager. The authority of the manager's position eroded over four more years.",

      "United can be blasé about Rashford, Antony and Scott McTominay thriving in a change of scenery. It would be different with the 20-year-olds Garnacho and Mainoo.",

      "Amorim has got to be less pragmatic, too. The 3-4-2-1 formation can be flexible but has hitherto been rigid. It is like-for-like substitutions and no shape-shifting. Amorim may plan ahead with substitutions but the opponents can as well. United do not deviate from a back three.",

      "The Food Standards Agency has handed the club an improvement notice after inspectors found cleanliness at the club was lacking, with dirty glasses and mouse droppings and concerns about opened food products being kept for too long.",
      "The rating follows an inspection in November which saw the club's rating downgraded from four to two, again following the discovery of mouse droppings. The club's standards of cleanliness have been under scrutiny since its food hygiene rating slashed from a five to a one star after hosting a health and safety event in November 2023 when raw chicken thighs were served to 30 people. Inspectors ruled at the time the food served was 'unfit for human consumption'.",
      "More than 250,000 people dine at the stadium's restaurants each season, with 29 kitchens and catering facilities operated from the site.",
      "A new report by Trafford Council inspectors following a visit on April 16 has heaped more criticism on the club. Mouse droppings were found behind seating in the Manchester Suite, under equipment in Devil's bar, in kiosks in two areas of the the north east quadrant, in a cupboard in the International Suite, under a buffet counter in Number 7 Suite and in the 'goods received' office, according to the report.",
      "The report ordered the club to: \"Ensure areas where droppings are present are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. You should continue to work with your pest control provider to take necessary actions.\"",
      "It also ordered more 'proofing' works to kitchen doors in Number 7 Suite and holes for utilities to Devil's bar as well as the external doors to the 'goods received' office after the inspectors found a strip had broken off.",
      "The report also recommended 'pest proofing' works at utilities holes at Devil's bar where droppings were found and also in the Manchester Suite as a 'large amount of droppings were found' in a room used to store tables close to food areas.",
      "The droppings found in the Manchester Suite were 'not fresh' but the report recommended the use of a vacuum cleaner to remove droppings rather than a brush as old droppings stuck in the hairs could be deposited while cleaning, said the report.",
      "The standard of cleaning in the Ambassador Suite required improvement because inspectors found 'food debris, grease and discarded cling film', said the report. A plate stacker in the suite was 'dirty'.",
      "The standard of cleaning in the Manchester Suite also 'requires improvement' because inspectors found 'dirt build up on surfaces where drinks lines run'. A 'deep clean' of the bars in the suite was required while the inside of fridges at one of the bars was 'dirty' which 'resulted in a build-up of detritus on glasses being stored within it', said the report.",
      "Inspectors also found 'some dirt build-up at low level areas in the walk-in freezer and large blast chiller' in a kitchen while 'dirt build-up' was found on sliding doors to a fridge in kiosks in two areas of the eastern side of the ground, according to the report.",
      "Club staff were unaware a tripped fuse had caused a lack of hot running water at a basin in the 'goods received' office while there was no soap at another basin in the Red Cafe, said the report, which ordered the club to have 'soap available for use at all times' at basins in the ground.",
      "Inspectors also found a container of pesto in a fridge at the Red Cafe had a '1 month' label attached to it even though the manufacturer recommended it should be used within eight days. A container of dressing also had a 1 month label attached even though the manufacturer said the product should be used within four weeks.",
      "The inspectors ordered the club to ensure staff were applying the correct shelf life to products 'as per manufacturer's instructions'.",

      "The timeframe for head coach Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United has been predicted, with one condition tipped to seal his fate.",
      "Amorim is among the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked as he’s endured a horrible six months at Old Trafford.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss was headhunted by INEOS following their decision to sack Erik ten Hag and he decided to join Man Utd mid-season, despite initially being against this idea.",
      "Amorim should be regretting this decision as he’s swapped a title race in Portugal to a basket case in Manchester as his dismal squad has failed to get accustomed to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Performances and results under Amorim have been worse than they were under Ten Hag as Man Utd are at risk of finishing 17th in the Premier League. They have also come up short in the Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup, so they won’t play in Europe next season.",
      "It would be harsh to sack Amorim before he’s had the opportunity to build a more-suited squad, but former Man Utd assistant Rene Meulensteen reckons he’ll be gone after ten games next season on one condition.",
      "“He has to win eight out of 10 or 90% of the games at the start of the season, that’s how long ten Hag was given (sacked after nine league and one EFL cup games on October 28th),” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "READ: Ranking every Manchester United player’s season: Horrible Hojlund to Fernandes via Garnacho",
      "“If he keeps doing what he’s doing, and sticks to the same system with the same players, then he won’t be there too long; there’s been no improvement.",
      "“I’ve not been very convinced by the way he has addressed the media. People applaud him for his honesty, but at some point, you have to realise the position at the club that you manage, and the position the club is in. What people want to hear is a vision, a strategy, a way forward.",
      "“People want to know how you can get out of this mess rather than reinforcing how bad it is, but I don’t hear that. He’s questioning too many things, and he’s questioning himself, and that is never a good thing.",
      "“Amorim should have done better because he’s had plenty of time now working with the players, and you question the disconnect when you constantly see these poor performances. Do they lack quality? Are the messages not getting across to the players? Or is it the rigid system?”",
      "Meulensteen has also argued that the “writing is on the wall” for Amorim, who has made one huge “mistake”.",
      "“The writing has been on the wall for quite some time. You could see there was a negative line in terms of performances and results under ten Hag. Eventually, when that line was persistently going down, they got rid of ten Hag to bring Amorim in,” Muelensteen added.",
      "“If you look through all the stats, all the numbers, and all the performances, that line continues to decline. Apart from in the Europa League, which was a different competition, and even then, it required luck in the miracle game against Lyon. They could have easily been knocked out, and you would have looked at a far more dour season.",
      "“Amorim made a mistake in the beginning by saying ‘I want to play the 3-4-3 system, and I’m not going to change’, so he started putting round pegs in square holes.",
      "“He could have done himself favours by saying, ‘I’m in favour of playing a 3-4-3, I’ve had a lot of success with it. However, I don’t know yet if that will work for Manchester United yet I need to get to know the players, I need to get to know the league’.",
      "“That would have given him far more flexibility to tweak it a little bit here and there, because at the end of the day, you’re in the results business.”",
      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho is reportedly ‘increasingly likely’ to leave the Premier League giants as he’s ‘unhappy’ with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been accused of committing a “sackable offence” in his side’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final ‘confirmed’ a ‘fear’ that Ruben Amorim has about his squad.",
      "Man Utd have responded to an offer from Ruben Amorim to leave Old Trafford without compensation after losing the Europa League final on Wednesday.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party."

      "As a Spurs fan, even at the best of times, you know you’re gonna get punched in the mouth every now and again. This season, it felt like being a few rounds deep with Muhammad Ali most weeks.",
      "Despite it all, for Ange Postecoglou and that group of players to persist and persevere, and push through all the negativity, the crises of confidence, the injuries, the noise, and to come out the other side holding their first trophy in nearly 20 years is inspiring.",
      "I only got to catch up on F365 mailboxes today, so I got a nice little chuckle at all the panicked rationalizing from other fans: It’s only the Europa League, two terrible teams, worst final ever, Don’t deserve Champions League, tallest dwarf, etc. Seeing opposition fans horrified that they can no longer ‘banter’ Spurs over being trophyless, and scrambling to find new sticks to beat Spurs it is delightful. You keep doing whatever you need to do guys, we’ll just keep watching the clips of Sonny lifting the cup on repeat. (Although credit to David Tickner, who I’ve criticised for his anti-Spurs takes before, for his magnanimous article celebrating Spurs and Ange!)",
      "But really I wanted to write in about Ange – and to say to Ange I’m sorry I ever doubted.",
      "I was a huge Ange advocate since the beginning. He wasn’t a mercenary like Jose or Conte, temporarily gracing lowly Spurs with his presence. He was a man with passion and a vision. He was going to make Spurs winners again. He was going to rebuild the culture at the club. He was going to make fans and players believe. And he was going to do it playing exciting, attacking football.",
      "The attacking, exciting football part has been a bit of a problem. It’s glorious when it’s good, but when it’s been bad, it’s been awful. Dizzyingly high defensive lines, gaps in positions, and a dreadful injury crisis meant we were cannon fodder for teams who could sit back and wait to counterattack on us. 20+ league defeats later, and even I, a big Ange-truther, was beginning to say this project had run its course.",
      "He was ridiculed in the press. He’s been hounded out of his job in every interview. F365 among others have kept a regularly refreshed list of his potential successors live on the site since October. When we were dumped out of the league cup and FA cup, journalists were quick to smugly ask him if he was still going to win something in his second season.",
      "And he did.",
      "For him to take all that flack for himself, to bear all the brunt of the criticism, so that the players could focus on the job to be done is incredible. He’s led them to success for the first time in 20 years. Something Conte, Pochettino, Mourinho, Redknapp never did. He always wins things in his second season, mate.",
      "But what now? I’m conflicted.",
      "The league form was truly awful, and while it might be absolved, given the Europa success, it could never be acceptable again. My head says maybe the best thing is for Ange to leave now as a hero, who brought this team back to the winners circle, and calls it a promise kept. Spurs move on, and bring in a Thomas Frank or someone to hopefully build on this momentum, but take us in a slightly new, more pragmatic direction. Fresh start.",
      "But I think the heart says different. Ange says his work is not yet done. And the players seem to agree. Despite everything, the likes of Van de Ven, Maddison, Kulusevski, Bissouma, Vicario and others have come to bat for Ange – “We want to win this for him”. For him to keep the belief of a dressing room after a season like that is incredible. After an achievement like Wednesday, that bond will be even stronger. If I thought Ange could adapt his style, and adopt elements of the pragmatic style that won him his last few European fixtures, and if the chairman could support him in the transfer market, then I think the option that would make me happiest is to see us press ahead with Big Ange!",
      "Either way, huge congrats to Ange – Spurs fans will never forget the success he’s brought. I’ll always be wishing for his success, in our dugout, or another.\nAndy, Spurs, Eire",
      "",
      "Ange stays and Ruben goes\nThanks to a flight delay, I got to watch the first 30 minutes of the Europa League final, but had to shut down before the goal. I wasn’t terribly disappointed to turn it off, because it was awful. When I landed, I learned the result and saw the goal credited to Brennan Johnson, but my son had commented in the EPL Discord group we share with my friends and their friends that it was a Shaw OG. That’s just funnier, and I would prefer to believe it.",
      "With many apologies to Tottenham supporters — you’ve my sincere congratulations on your Europa League win, and I’m quite jelly, because it beats our pot sideways — I generally appreciate F365’s evident editorial pleasure in regarding Spurs as Spursy and openly endorsing in advance the funniest possible Europa League Final narrative vis-à-vis Spurs. I hope you’ll understand: it’s an objectively funny narrative precisely because it’s silly.",
      "So, Spurs haven’t won a trophy in 17 years? Cry me a river. That’s far more success than Newcastle United or Crystal Palace could boast in 2024, so it’s hard to feel very bad about having that particular laugh. Especially when it’s more or less true; Spurs’ league form has been shocking.",
      "But I agree with Tickner and several Mailbox contributors that the cup win changes things for Ange Postecoglou. Unless you want to consider the possibility that he’s the Kwisatz Haderach, you have to treat his prophecy as merely a demonstrable trend. This is the fifth consecutive job in which he’s won a trophy in his second season, and trophies aren’t available every year for an international coach. I’ve little doubt he left the Australia job precisely because he knew he couldn’t win them a World Cup, asked himself what succeeding would look like, and didn’t like the answer.",
      "Big Ange may just be what he appears to be at this moment: a remarkably adaptable coach for whom short-term success is very likely, but is only now beginning his first attempt at sustained success at the highest level. I’m not aware of how much input he has in transfers, but I’d call most of the bigger outlays attributed to him moderately successful; extremely successful, if the goal Levy set was a trophy in year two.",
      "Spurs supporters may have a different perspective, but I have a lifetime of experience with volatile team owners in the US, and it’s hard for me to imagine Daniel Levy firing Ange right now. It would alienate many (though I suspect not all) supporters, and trophies are what an owner looks for in a coach or manager. Prize money, and the guarantee of more prize money next year.",
      "And if Levy does push the eject button, Ange will likely have a wealth of opportunities and a very happy agent. He’s in the catbird seat right now, as we inexplicably say in the Southeastern US.",
      "Also: given our cup history over my lifetime, I can almost never find it in myself to be disappointed with a Manchester United loss. The stats seem to suggest they should have won, and Amorim is accused of mismanagement in 16 Conclusions. Indeed, one wonders if a Jim Ratcliffe-influenced board might just snatch at his offer to decline compensation if sacked.",
      "A financial path forward for ManU is tough to chart. Among the academy graduates, Mainoo seems to be the most saleable asset, and his value is debatable at the moment and is most likely greatest as a homegrown member of the squad. Abandoning the 343 (or however you want to characterize Amorim’s system) and hiring a manager to make better use of the talent already present — Mason Mount might qualify, for example — while the rebuild proceeds in a more natural direction might be a good idea.",
      "What Manchester United needs is flexibility, and Amorim may not be able to provide that on the available transfer budget. Or willing to provide it at all. On the other hand, they won’t have the bother of Europe next season.\nChris C, Toon Army DC (Ambivalent over the playoff final. LALAS or derbies? Both are wonderful.)",
      "",
      "Over the United fatalism\nWhat did we learn out of the Europa League final that we didn’t already know? Honest question…",
      "A United team which has been poor for six-odd months was poor again and lost. The overall depth and quality of a team which is shoddy in defence, lacks bite and control in midfield, and has next-to-no goals in it was, you guessed it, shoddy in defence, lacked bite and control in midfield and drew a blank.",
      "Spurs, to their credit, were able to be slightly less poor on the night and unconvincingly accounted for the worst United side in 50 years.",
      "Well done.",
      "But can we put a pin in the Manchester United fatalism? No United fan is happy with where the Club sits, how it’s being managed and how it’s performing – but maybe, just maybe, this is the opportunity to properly, actually reset the Club has needed for years.",
      "No papering over the cracks, no playing dress-ups at the big table of European football, no fixtures and competitions we’re nowhere near good enough to properly compete in for now…",
      "This is the chance to start a build we should’ve undertaken post-Jose. A proper, top-to-bottom rebuild. The open-heart surgery Rangnick diagnosed.",
      "Easier said than done, sure, and a far from linear process… but a chance to move beyond the quick fix, short term vanity signings which have plagued us for years and look for players who a/ fit a profile and method of play and b/ are not signing to pump up their pensions.",
      "And before anyone starts, if rival fans seriously think there’s no allure to signing for and becoming a Manchester United star, you’re kidding yourself. So let’s find the players for whom that means something.",
      "Come in, be a part of something from the ground up and be a reason this Club turns things around. It’s Manchester United – something which has always meant something and still does, no matter how loudly opposition fans protest it doesn’t.",
      "And on the fatalism… worst case for Manchester United is results get so dire the Glazers sell up and f**k off. Which would be a magnificent result – maybe the single worst result for the Club’s rivals, to be honest.",
      "It’s pretty easy to support your team when the going is good. For all the disappointments in recent times they’ve given me plenty to cheer about across the journey… I now hope they can begin the slow march back towards contention at home and abroad.\nSean Peter-Budge, Melbourne, Australia",

      "Suck it up\nGet a grip.",
      "This is my message to my fellow Man Utd fans.",
      "We are in the ‘find out’ phase of a decade and a half of chronic incompetence; mistakes compounded by mistakes; a relentless pursuit of a sunken cost fallacy brought on by our arrogance, impatience and an overbearing weight of expectation.",
      "We have chopped and changed managers and gameplans every 3yrs never allowing for any true synergy between manager and squad. We have signed players based on reputation and commercial viability with leveraged transfer fees that we still owe around £300m on. We have doled out massive, long term contracts to panic buys & ‘marquee’ signings which has had the knock on effect of massively inflating wages throughout the squad. Basically, think of any clichéd football mistake and we have made it repeatedly. Of course we’re shite!",
      "Our situation right now has been inevitable for a long time. What we need to do now is shut up, take our medicine and be patient. If you need somewhere to focus your frustration and anger about it all, the Glazers should be the target. INEOS haven’t been perfect (SJR’s petty cuts towards the ordinary folk at the club are pointless besides demonstrating that he is a monumental tw*t) but they have been sound so far with transfers; Yoro, Dorgu, Ugarte, Zirkzee and Heaven have all looked good so far.",
      "The last thing we need to do is sack Amorim. We need a period of continuity where we have a plan and we stick to it. There are too many mitigating factors to confidently say that he is the problem.",
      "343 looks like the incoming paradigm so remoulding our squad to fit it is a sound, forward thinking plan even if we do eventually move on from Amorim.",
      "Amorim being pragmatic and adapting to the players we have would just be repeating Erik Ten Hag’s mistake. Form would improve then inevitably tank as he tries to transition to his style. He’d get sacked anyway, the next manager would inherit another Frankenstein squad and we’ll be back to square one. Better to just push ahead with his ideas and get the most painful phase out the way first. We will improve when he has more suitable players.",
      "Being out of Europe gives us an opportunity to cull the squad this summer. If we set our target for next season to a top 10 finish, we can be more bold with game time for academy players and aim lower (with a much broader pool) for signings with an emphasis on suitability for the system.",
      "We are in a reset phase where our expectations need to be adjusted to give us time & space to lay new foundations.",
      "There is reason for optimism but stop expecting it all to happen immediately. The boat has sailed on any hope of a quick fix. We now need to be methodical and precise.",
      "And for those of us who grew up in the glory days, now is the time to prove for once and for all that we are not glory hunters.\nTom, Tooting",
      "",
      "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes\nI read recently to my dismay and bitter disappointment that Amorim said he did not intend to change anything. If this is true, it would the most irresponsible and uncaring statement a Head Coach can make.",
      "Under Amorim’s reign, Man United have set and broken all sorts of unwanted, undesired and humiliating records.  Most United fans are hurting and, for the Head Coach to say he would not change anything, is more than an insult.",
      "Results and performances don’t lie. Clearly, his system, tactics, mass rotation, team selection and substitutions have, by and large, failed. In my profession, as it is in all other professions and areas of human endeavour, if the situation is retrogressing, changes are identified and made. I don’t belong to the school of thought which advocates the unnecessary sacking of coaches but, if Amorim’s publicly professed contention is not to make changes, then he must leave. No changes would lead to more pain next season and that is not acceptable.",
      "I urge all United fans and everyone who has interest in our beloved club to impress upon Amorim to make effective changes. Changes constitute a ‘sini qua non’ for success.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",

      "Please compare Liverpool and ManU’s deroute and ways of tackling them during their respective transitions. What errors have the two clubs made? What good things have they done? Why was the transition in Liverpool ultimately a success, while it doesn’t look too good for ManU? Where have ManU repeated the errors made by LFC? And why haven’t they learned anything from history?",
      "And probably many more questions.",
      "Thanks",
      "Kind regards\nMichael from Denmark  – LFC-fan,  but curious about the similarities between the two mastodons and their situations (both Hicks/Gilette and the Glazers are nincompoops!)."

      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe will ‘axe 200 jobs’ on Friday and staff morale at the club has hit ‘rock bottom’.",
      "INEOS chief Ratcliffe has been heavily criticised over the past year as he’s quickly become an incredibly unpopular figure at Man Utd.",
      "Initially, the British billionaire’s takeover was met with overwhelming positivity, but this has swiftly eroded as he’s made several brutal cuts.",
      "One of Ratcliffe’s priorities has been to cut costs at Old Trafford and while this is necessary, some cuts have been deemed overly severe as morale at the club has taken a severe hit.",
      "Ratcliffe has sanctioned mass redundancies, cut benefits to club legends, scrapped free lunches for staff and has hiked ticket prices.",
      "READ: Manchester United ‘brains trust’ demoted while Slot ‘turns on’ Alexander-Arnold (and Salah)",

      "‘Sources have expressed surprise at the timing of the move to deliver the latest news to staff, so soon after the defeat in Bilbao, but the club would appear keen to make savings as soon as possible, especially after missing out on the £100million windfall of Champions League qualification.’",
      "A few hours later, a report from The Telegraph confirmed Man Utd will ‘axe 200 jobs today’, with staff morale at ‘rock bottom’.",
      "Around 250 staff were dismissed last summer and a further 200 individuals ‘will discover if they have lost their jobs today’.",
      "It is noted that ‘swingeing cuts’ are expected with staff ‘braced’ to be affected in areas ‘across an array of football and non-football departments, including scouting, analysts and commercial, as United streamline operations’.",
      "There could be ugly scenes at Old Trafford on Sunday as Man Utd host Aston Villa in their final game of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The 1958 fans’ group have confirmed plans for another protest against Ratcliffe and the Glazer family on Sunday.",
      "“We will start on Sir Matt Busby Way to symbolise the standards that are being decayed and lost, installed by Sir Matt and profoundly precious to all of us,” the 1958 said.",
      "“The club is drowning in over a billion pounds of debt, our fanbase is fractured and divided and our stadium neglected – [all] down to Glazer greed and betrayal. They’ve taken everything.",
      "“Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers’ reign. Lifelong loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love – priced out and pushed aside. Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community.",
      "“We march. As one fanbase. To make it clear: 20 years on, the fire still burns Red – with fury and defiance. We want the Glazers out of our club.”",

      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag at the end of 2024, losing 16 of his 41 matches in all competitions.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon initially wanted to join Man Utd at the end of this season, but INEOS pushed for him to arrive immediately and this has backfired.",
      "The 40-year-old has attempted to implement a new system in the middle of the season and has unsurprisingly found this incredibly difficult with Man Utd’s squad unsuited to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Without ready-made wing-backs or suitable No.10s, Man Utd’s system has been ineffective for months as they have been toothless in attack.",
      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "Man Utd could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season and they were dealt a severe blow on Wednesday night, losing 1-0 to Spurs in the Europa League final to miss out on a trophy and Champions League football.",
      "Carragher thinks Man Utd chiefs need to start asking whether they ‘appointed the wrong manager at the wrong time’.",
      "‘At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: “Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?”’ Carragher wrote for The Telegraph.",
      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe may still believe Ruben Amorim is one of the best young coaches of his generation. He may think that, had Amorim not joined United last November, he would have been hired by another top European club and excelled.",
      "‘He may also be sure that if United had the same funds to rebuild the team as Amorim’s predecessors had at their disposal, it would be a question of when, not if, United return to the top of the English and European game.",
      "‘But in the aftermath of a dismal Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, the dilemma around Amorim is more complicated than for any of those who have tried and failed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.’",
      "Carragher has also floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Amorim and Man Utd amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "‘Now that his six months in charge have gone so badly, Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues will need a decisive plan for how he will navigate the club through the most challenging period in United’s modern history,’ Carragher continued.",
      "‘Their grave concern must be that they have seen absolutely no evidence so far to suggest he is up to it. On that basis, backing Amorim this summer may be the honourable option, but it is not necessarily the bravest.",
      "‘Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.’",
      "He added: ‘The much-anticipated tactical innovations, and development of younger players, have been non-existent.",
      "‘The only successful game-changing strategy Amorim has offered is throwing Harry Maguire up front for the final few minutes of European games.’",

      "Whatever floats your boat. But while we’re here, what was this bombshell Slot dropped on the departing Alexander-Arnold? Did he burn one of his shirts, or call him Jude Bellingham’s side piece?",
      "Not quite. He just said, “I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute he was on training ground. In my opinion there were certain moments he could do more, to put it mildly. I told him he’s a much better defender than people think, but you don’t show it all the time.”",
      "Which is a) hardly a particularly controversial thing for a new manager to say to a player, and most importantly b) not the full quote, despite that being all the MailOnline offers.",
      "There is, handily enough, footage of a press conference in which Slot expands considerably further on his point:",
      "“Maybe he said it himself, he’s going to leave either way so why not tell. Maybe it’s already a first gift I can give Xabi Alonso. But I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion in certain moments he could do a bit more, to say it mildly, and that’s what we talked about.",
      "“Combined with that I said to him: ‘You are a much better defender than everybody tells you, unfortunately you don’t show it all the time, that’s why people sometimes say you are not’.",
      "“If he is just at it and focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around him, because he’s fast, he’s agile, he has great mentality.",
      "“But it’s about showing that every single game, because in this world we are judged not only on the 34 games we do well, we are mainly judged on the four games we don’t do so well.",
      "“These things we spoke about in pre-season.”",
      "Again, it sounds a hell of a lot like an incoming coach having some pretty standard, constructive observations about one of his new players. And the best bit is that Slot’s answer was prefaced with this line, which changes everything completely:",
      "“I think Mo has said already a few things about why he was in my office in pre-season and there were similar reasons why Trent was in my office in the beginning of the season!”",
      "So this was in pre-season and Slot had similar conversations with Salah, who recently explained: “He showed me a few videos of myself in the warm-up. I was like quite slow, didn’t do much. Then he showed me, ‘look at the second [player] after he sees you take it easy, look at the third one’. Then you see the whole line walking like me and he said, ‘that’s your influence on the team’.”",
      "Did Slot ‘turn on’ Salah and ‘fire criticism’ at him at the time? Or does it only count when the player in question is in the middle of a controversial departure?",

      "However, the chances of Man Utd recouping the £47m that they paid Inter Milan for Onana are very slim and ex-Red Devils defender Brown insists fans have to realise that selling a player is not as easy as “pressing one button”.",
      "Brown told bestbettingsites.co.uk: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The INEOS brains trust can only be trusted with one more decision\nAs a United fan who didn’t even bother watching the Europa League final, I’m not the least bit surprised by the outcome. Manchester United are in complete shambles right now. The arrival of Ratcliffe has been so disastrous that even Ed Woodward starts to look like a footballing genius in comparison.",
      "United’s problems are numerous, but the most glaring issue is this: we can’t even decide what’s worse — the players or the managers. When it comes to both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, it’s safe to say that, as poor as the current squad is, the managers have been even worse. And therein lies the root of our troubles.",
      "We have no Director of Football. Our scouting network is non-existent or laughable at best. This leaves the manager (the one who can’t do their own jobs) to also do the scouting, resulting in hundreds of millions wasted on signings who have consistently failed to meet expectations. Under Ten Hag, huge sums were spent chasing his priority targets, yet almost every one of them has proven to be a disappointment. In contrast, Amorin is still demadning players for a system that has shown no evidence of working in the Premier League.",
      "The reality? United are expected to finish this season with 39 points — just above the relegation zone. In many other seasons, that would have meant relegation. Remember the outrage when United finished 7th under David Moyes, and that was without the financial backing ETH was given for instance.",
      "So what’s the solution?",
      "Unfortunately, the current management structure is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There will be no Director of Football appointment, no meaningful improvement to the scouting network, and no overhaul of the training facilities. The people in charge simply don’t seem capable of making the right decisions.",
      "This leaves us with only one viable option — one that comes with the caveat that it has not worked out too well in the past but is the only realistic path forward now. We need to hire an experienced, truly elite manager. Someone with a proven track record of winning titles and the full backing of the club. This manager should be entrusted with all football decisions — from which players to buy and sell, to upgrading facilities, restructuring the medical team, and establishing a reliable scouting and data analysis network.",
      "Most importantly, this manager must be given complete autonomy, no matter how much resistance or dissent there may be from players, he must be backed to the hilt season after season. Because the only thing the current board and management can be trusted with is one decision only, hiring the manager. And that too out of sheer necessity. Beyond that, let the only adult at the club (read: new manager hopefully) make all the decisions from thereon. Because, this United board and management have proven repeatedly that to allow them to make even a single more decision would be folly of the highest order.\nAdeel",

      "So, for the third season in a row, United found themselves in a cup final looking to salvage their season, only this time, they went to the well and they found there was nothing left for them.",
      "You can’t keep putting off the inevitable. This is a large scale rebuild. It will involve gradually shipping out 10 players and trying to bring in 10 who are an improvement on those going out. That’s a 3, 4, 5 year project. There is no quick fix. There are no shortcuts. The last two years have been sticking plasters, but you can’t keep putting plasters on open fractures. Sooner or later you have to accept that you require more advanced help.",
      "As I have said previously, the problem with United is that are yet to confront their reality. They may have the most Instagram followers in Kenya or whatever, but that is worth absolutely nothing on a football pitch. They need to accept where they are and what they are. Until they do, they will continue to go backwards.\nAndy H, Swansea.",

With greater finances involved in modern football, it has insulated us for longer, but not for much longer, at this rate in any case. I will never stop loving my club and all its glorious (and inglorious) history, but I am really not looking forward to more of the same next season.",
      "A good start would be to stop losing to Spurs! Nothing against them, but four defeats to Tottenham in the same season? Four?! That’s insane. I’m pleased for big Ange, a man often luckless, scorned and derided. But to actually deliver on his pre-season pledge to “always” win a trophy in his second season? Gotta admire the man’s Tottenham Chutzpah. Just wish he didn’t have to do it at our expense!",

      "Manchester United (1878-2025) is over. I was thinking earlier this season, as a Liverpool fan, that if somehow they got relegated I would quit watching football or caring about the Premier League altogether (not the Champions League of course….) because it would be meaningless to entertain a rivalry when your biggest rival has been destroyed beyond repair. Of course, they didn’t get relegated -but gave it shot- yet United being United, they managed to produce an outcome just as humiliating and unbelievable; lose a European final to Tottenham. (To add insult to injury, without Maddison, Kulusevski, Bergvall…. basically, their best attacking options) 🤯",
      "Lost a European final to Tottenham… (try not to laugh reading that over and over again). They will have to live with that stain forever now. The last European trophy Spurs won was against Anderlecht, a club which fittingly has disappeared from the world stage. How do you live past that as a “proud football club” when Tottenham was the perennial butt of jokes for a reason?? Even hours before the match Paul Scholes was asked to revisit on TV the “lads, it’s Tottenham” pep talk Fergie gave them in the dressing room which became a meme, running joke, soundbite whatever to exemplify the complete helplessness and failure inherent to Tottenham. And yet, you’ve become their b****, Spurs beat them 4 times this season!!! 🤣",
      "In the end of the day, level at league titles and with twice as many European cups, the history books will tell the story that Liverpool beat Tottenham in a Champions League final but Manchester United lost to Spurs in a Europa League final. There are levels to this game. Liverpool has to find a new “biggest fixture” to look forward to because the English Derby no longer is. We may have to manufacture a rivalry with City going forward because United died this season. They’re just the gift that keeps on giving, having perfected the art of failure. You could not script a better season ending from a Liverpool fan’s standpoint.\nRaúl H. García (Number 7 next season and I’m done) LFC-YNWA 1892",

      "I was reading bits of the mailbox and Man Utd fans thinking out loud about how to forge a path ahead. Youth was mentioned an awful lot but here is the thing: if you were a talented player under 16 you would not sign for Man Utd right now.",
      "To protect kids and not disrupt families most clubs have to recruit within a geography but that means that Man Utd are competing with Man City and Liverpool for top youth players. Which team would you rather sign for if you were 12 years old right now?",
      "There’s no class of 92 that’s going to be emerging any time soon in my opinion. And the class of 92 had top professionals like Cantona to learn from; who would a kid in the youth team look up to right now other than Bruno?",
      "The club has cancer and it’s been allowed to persist so long that it’s infected almost everything. That combined with a disgruntled feeling from all the staff who Genius Jim has screwed to save £58 a week means that the morale couldn’t be lower.",
      "I don’t see Amorim as the answer and this £100m summer war Chest won’t go far when so much is about to be spent on Cunha making a step down.",
      "I’m obviously enjoying this malaise rather a lot. The summer of optimism will also be great before it comes crashing down on opening day when you lose at home to Fulham.\nMinty, LFC",
      "",
      "We do talk about Bruno\nI was really glad one of your 16 Conclusions on the final picked up on the double Bruno Fernandes turnover in the Spurs half prior to the goal. This gets glossed over so many times, especially when United play well or get a result. The amount of times he gives the ball away unnecessarily is astonishing.",
      "It got me to thinking after the game. If Fernandes were the talisman he is reputed to be. If he’s such a great goal scorer, creator, leader, why have none of the big clubs not come in for him? At the very least, why has there not been the odd rumour at the end of a non-disastrous season, linking him with Spain, Italy or Bayern?",
      "I think the answer to this is that they don’t want him. Is he a good player? Absolutely! But he’s not good enough to be constantly forgiven his wasteful passes, Hollywood balls, whining and moaning at the ref and team mates? I can’t understand how the 6 managers (interim included) he’s worked under since joining United have all deemed him undroppable. Not just that, he’s rarely subbed off",
      "United are in a very precarious position right now. There was talk earlier this season of a relegation battle. I shrugged that off, thinking there’s no way the quality of the teams at the bottom of the table would threaten a side of full internationals. But watching the game last night I could honestly say that I wouldn’t put a tenner on United to beat any of the 3 relegated sides if they were to meet in a week’s time with full strength sides. I don’t think the teams coming up this season from the Championship will be as bad as the 3 going down and I think Leeds and Burnley will have learned their lessons form previous bounces and prepare better for the upcoming top flight season.",
      "So if United want to keep doing the same thing, with the same players, then I genuinely feel next season could be worse than this. And if Bruno Fernandes is still the captain, playing 90 mins every week, no matter how bad his performances are, then they can have no complaints if next May they find themselves in must win matches to avoid dropping to the championship.",
      "I would like to clarify that I’m not laying all the blame for the current sh*t show at his feet. There are a number of players not fit to wear the shirt and the managers have to take a lot of blame too. But this is one area that seems to be constantly ignored and needs to be debated. Are United better off with Fernandes or without. Some fans might see Fernandes leaving as the last finger pulled from the dyke but I think his removal from the team would allow others to step up with an increased focus on in-game tactics. Just look what happened PSG when Mbappe left and the team became less of a one man show.\nMick, Newcastle",

      "Tinpot\nI’d like to address the concept that because of the finalists poor league performance and the poor quality game that the Europa League is now a tinpot trophy and shouldn’t get CL qualification.",
      "By this logic Wigan’s famous win, which wasn’t a great game, the same year they got relegated made the FA cup a championship level competition not worth European qualification.",
      "What about Denmark or Greece winning the Euros? Not the biggest teams nor the best football which would make that competition tinpot now as well.",

Even Tiramisu becomes boring after the fifteen bowl. Probably. The rewards being divided between the wealthy few is bad for everyone so I make this a good season.",

      "Team to watch: Nottingham Forest\nBy far the most interesting of the Champions League chasers by simple virtue of novelty, while we also can’t deny we enjoy the fact that the Premier League could send interlopers off to the Big Cup for two years in a row, and those teams both in fact be former winners of said cup from before football was invented.",
      "Alas, a team that had everything safely in their own hands, spending much of the season in the top three, has wobbled sufficiently to leave their chances of a top-five finish now on the slender side.",
      "Even a month ago, Forest were sitting pretty in fourth, with a game in hand that could take them back above Man City and a three-point lead over Chelsea in sixth.",
      "Four games and five points later, they are on the outside looking in. The fact they face Chelsea on the final day is a half-full or half-empty situation depending on how you choose to view it.",
      "While they face undeniably the hardest task of the five teams scrapping for the remaining three places alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and – stop giggling – Tottenham in next season’s Champions League, they do at least know that a win for them automatically takes care of one of the two failures they need from a rival.",
      "If Forest take care of their own business they just need a stumble from Villa or Newcastle. And while Forest’s form has stalled – although it has by no means been a total collapse – they have had enough memorable days at the City Ground this season to believe they can deliver one last blow to the establishment, if only to save Nuno Espirito Santo from another confrontation with an angry iPhone 7-wielding owner.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Ruben Amorim\nOne of the great unique elements about the final day is the vast chasm in importance it can carry for two clubs in the same game.",
      "Sure, your Nottingham Forest v Chelseas are great, all-to-play-for head-to-heads that can determine the success or failure of entire seasons. And we’ve already dispensed with our usual miserabilism to look fondly at the great big party that’s about to go off at Anfield for Premier League winners Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "But perhaps the most fun final-day games are those between teams still fighting for a big prize and those who have just had their dreams crushed to dirt by the only club in the entire country that might be as ridiculous as they are.",
      "Step forward, Manchester United and their beleaguered life-choices-reconsidering manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The good news for Amorim and the lads is that they will almost certainly avoid the ignominy of finishing 17th even in the very likely event that they cannot rouse themselves from Wednesday night’s disappointment in Bilbao to stop an in-form, Champions League-chasing Aston Villa.",
      "But that’s only because Tottenham’s preparation for their own final game of the season against Brighton has been comprised entirely of memes, full-kit wankering, beer, cigars, parades and settling 17-year-old scores with Domino’s Pizza.",
      "While last-laugh-having Postecoglou faces the challenge of identifying his 11 least hungover players, Amorim and his team face an altogether different kind of headache.",
      "There is a grim fascination to be had in watching just what kind of performance Amorim and United are able to pluck from their arse against a very good side with no thoughts yet of the beach. We have a strong suspicion that the answer is ‘sh*tbone awful’ but, while nothing can be done now to save a season that saw all its remaining eggs trampled under Cristian Romero’s boots on Wednesday, a broken club in utter disarray could do with at least something to send them into the summer with some vague hope that things might be all right in the end.",

      "As almost everyone else’s season winds down, or in many cases has long since already wound down, the Blues face a decisive Champions League six-pointer at Forest on Sunday, then a European final three days later, and then after a moment to catch their breath head off to the States for the Club World Cup that absolutely everybody definitely wanted and needed and is in no way just a giant player-flogging FIFA cash cow.",
      "In circumstances like these, it is entirely unhelpful for your only real recognised number nine to bag himself a three-game suspension. Nicolas Jackson has done just that, though, and is still out for the vital trip to the City Ground.",
      "With Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu also out or at the very best extremely doubtful, the challenge of getting Chelsea over the line here before turning attention to the uncommonly large and important challenges that still await them in this never-ending season falls on the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho, back in contention here having been ineligible for the win over Manchester United.",
      "It really is a time when Chelsea could do with Palmer stepping up after a Difficult Second Season. Or Difficult Second Half Of Second Season, more fairly.",
      "Last month’s from-behind win at Fulham was, absurdly, Chelsea’s first and only Premier League away win since a 4-3 caper at Tottenham in early December. It’s a 10-game run in which Chelsea have scored only five goals and been shut out six times.",
      "Palmer himself hasn’t scored a Premier League goal away from home since opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw at Palace on the first weekend of January. That came near the end of a run of seven goals in nine Premier League games.",
      "His only goal since that run was a nerve-settling late penalty in the 3-1 win over a partying Liverpool.",
      "Sunday, at a team with the joint best home defensive record in the league, would be a fine time to step up. And unlike at almost every other club in the country, it’s even quite a useful time to get back into form for the further challenges that lie immediately ahead.",

      "Football League game to watch: Sheffield United v Sunderland\nWe’ve already had a curious taste of a play-off final style game thanks to the unique circumstances that turned this year’s Europa League final into a Champions League play-off, with much attention given to the financial prize on offer and the chance for one of the two teams to spend next season being ritually humiliated at a higher level for which they are painfully ill-equipped and unprepared.",
      "So yeah, nothing at all like the Championship play-off final. Hopefully this will be at least a more watchable and entertaining game than we saw in Bilbao, and the Championship play-off final does traditionally deliver on that front.",
      "There’s no chance of a new club in the Premier League this time around with Sheffield United and Sunderland bidding to join other familiar faces from Leeds and Burnley.",
      "Sunderland would bring the greater novelty having not been seen in the top flight since 2017 and spending a good few years of the interim down in League One, but it’s Sheffield United – automatic promotion contenders for most of the season – who will start as favourites.",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Napoli v Cagliari\nWe generally try to avoid Friday night games but the Serie A title race is clearly the place to go this weekend and that means Friday night lights are our only option as Napoli and Inter scrap it out for the title.",
      "Both slipped up last weekend, leaving Napoli a point clear and with destiny still in their own hands as they seek a second title success in three years. Victory over Cagliari will do the job, delivering Antonio Conte a Serie A title with a third club after also tasting glory with Inter and Juventus.",

He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",

      "This angered Garnacho, who has opened the door to an exit in a bombshell interview after being “thrown under the bus” by Amorim.",
      "Reacting to these comments, Jordan blasted the winger, who has been described as a “little weakling”.",

      "Jordan has also predicted Man Utd’s Premier League finish next season, with a “bounce” from 16th expected.",
      "“We’re seeing an erosion and if it keeps going for another ten years, you’re going to see the analogy that I made of Manchester City being Red Bull and Manchester United being Ferrari, being eroded because the next generation of fans are light upon winners and United are not winners,” Jordan added.",
      "“I think we just saw United hit the bottom. You cannot make a case for Manchester United to be finishing 16th in the Premier League, two places above the relegation spot and putting out a performance.",
      "“United were abject and they’ve lost the final in such an abject manner with so much riding on it, so many opportunities to change the direction of travel.",
      "“I think you’ve just witnessed the United beast hit the bottom and then that’s when you start to bounce and I think you’ll see a bounce. Now, what that bounce looks like, it might mean that United finish tenth next season and not 17th.”",

      "This provides a huge boost to Spurs as this victory arguably saves a disastrous season, with a trophy, Champions League football and huge money sealed.",

      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "United’s run in the Europa League has been their only saving grace in a shambolic season, but they are facing an uncertain future without the cash injection provided by a return to the Champions League.",
      "A huge squad overhaul is required, with most of Ruben Amorim’s squad unsuited to the head coach’s preferred style and/or not good enough to be a starter for the Big Six club.",
      "It has been indicated that the Red Devils could need to sell to buy this summer, but Ornstein has moved to reassure the club’s supporters ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "In a Q&A for The Athletic, Ornstein explained: “United were budgeting for no European football next season and therefore last night would have been extremely painful but not a complete shock.”",
      "He continued: “The money was there to do a couple of deals (Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap are the club’s original preferences but let’s see how it all unfolds), and then there would need to be some sales.",
      "“Naturally, for the many negative financial implications connected to their loss in that final, there are also some crumbs of comfort, like not having to pay the Champions League qualification bonuses that exist in most player contracts.",
      "“United have remained PSR-compliant until this point, but I think next year was always going to be a bigger challenge, and that’s partly why we’ve seen the club engage in such drastic cost-cutting measures.",
      "“It is also why significant player sales will be required, including potentially some homegrown talents who represent pure profit in accounting terms.”",

      "Wednesday's defeat, by far the costliest of a miserable campaign given the financial implications of missing out on a Champions League spot, was yet another reminder that the vast majority of Amorim's players are unsuited to his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "It is clear that extensive changes are required to equip him with the players he needs to have a chance of making it work. But they will not come cheaply. It is problematic given the potential impact of no European football on the club's already-fraught finances.",
      "Besides, there is no guarantee the changes would bring success. Have the club's decision-makers seen enough in the last six months to suggest the level of investment required is worth the risk? Results have actually worsened since Amorim's appointment.",
      "They are banking on a drastic change of fortunes but they also have to consider where an expensive round of recruitment tailored to Amorim's specific set-up would leave them when he eventually goes.",
      "What use are expensively acquired wing-backs to a potential successor who prefers a back four? What use are narrow No 10s to one who favours touchline-hugging wingers?",
      "The accepted wisdom is that Manchester United need to break the cycle of signing players for specific managers then ripping up and starting again when a change is required. But the worry is that minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe now risks perpetuating it.",
      "Amorim is not alone in using a back three, of course. But he is certainly in a minority among managers. Across all Premier League games this season, back fours have been used 77 per cent of the time, with back threes only used 23 per cent of the time.",
      "The same disparity can be seen in Europe. Simone Inzaghi may yet win the Champions League with a back three but Inter Milan are one of only two sides to reach this season's knockout stages who habitually use a three over four, the other being Amorim's former club Sporting, who are already onto their second appointment since his exit, with Rui Borges having replaced Joao Pereira.",
      "It is not that the system cannot work, it is just that the pool of potential successors to Amorim who actually use it is a small one. While Manchester United appear committed to their man, with no plans to make a change, the reality is that the moment will come, and it might be sooner than they hope.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta gave Kieran Tierney and Jorginho the chance to say goodbye to the Emirates Stadium with late cameos in last Sunday's 1-0 win over Newcastle but Raheem Sterling, another player set to depart this summer, was an unused substitute.",
      "It remains to be seen whether he will get any minutes at Southampton on the final day but, having been unable to make a mark during his loan spell from Chelsea, he looked a slightly incongruous presence during Arsenal's lap of appreciation.",
      "With more than 600 senior games in his legs, Sterling is approaching the twilight of his career at 30 but there was a reminder of just how special he was this week when Kevin De Bruyne picked him out as his favourite team-mate during an interview with Jamie Redknapp.",
      "Those runs have become increasingly rare. Sterling's playing time has dropped to a new low this season. Arsenal fans haven't seen him at anything close to his best and neither have those of Chelsea, where he still has a year left to run on his contract.",
      "Sterling is unlikely to ever get a send-off like his former team-mate De Bruyne but his outstanding achievements, as a player who ranks among the Premier League's top 20 for both goals and assists, with 123 and 65 respectively in 395 games, should not be forgotten even as his powers wane.",
      "Eberechi Eze was given most of the evening off against Wolves on Tuesday following his match-winning heroics in Crystal Palace's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City but he still made his mark, adding a superb fourth goal only five minutes after his introduction.",
      "Attention will soon turn to his future. He will not be short of suitors this summer. But for now, provided he is not playing against your team, it is best to just enjoy a player flourishing into one of the Premier League's best. He has been a pleasure to watch this season.",
      "Bruno Guimaraes' completeness was the focus of last week's column. There was also a look at how Arsenal have missed Kai Havertz and the importance of Mikkel Damsgaard's pressing to Brentford."

      "The teenage left-back's first Gunners start came in December but there was just something about him - his football arrogance, his ability to take the ball under pressure without fear or error and his consistency.",
      "Since then, he has become first-choice in that role and with England's left-back role at his feet too - a meteoric and unchallenged rise.",
      "And there is more to come - expect Lewis-Skelly to transition into midfield in the coming years.Sam Blitz",
      "Last season's top two, Man City and Arsenal, served up a pair of contrasting classics, starting with a bad-tempered, but intriguing four-goal classic at the Etihad in September that appeared to be going the visitors' way - that is, until John Stones's scrambled 98th-minute equaliser sent the home fans crazy, while breaking Gunners' hearts after almost holding on for the win since half-time with just 10 players.",
      "The return meeting at the Emirates in February may have lacked that tension, but the quality of Arsenal's five-star display that ripped the champions apart more than made up for it, with young left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly showing just why we selected him as our Young Player of the Year.",
      "However, our game of the season features the champions, although it is not their drama-filled 2-2 draw in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in February when James Tarkowski thundered home a 98th-minute equaliser that made the famous old ground shake.",
      "Rather it is Liverpool's visit to Newcastle United in early December that was this campaign's standout match and not just because it finished 3-3! The clash in the north east had all the ingredients that make up a classic, being played under the St James' Park lights, producing an electric atmosphere as a result, and plenty of goals, including a contender for strike of the season from Magpies forward Alexander Isak and then late drama when the hosts levelled matters.",

      "In fact, Sels' player-of-the-match performance to prevent Liverpool from taking all three points at Nottingham Forest in January features several world-class stops that all came under consideration.",
      "There were several other saves that caught the eye during the season, such as Emi Martinez displaying ridiculous reactions to prevent Chris Wood's header from crossing the line at the City Ground in December, Andre Onana diving full length to deny Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr and Alphonse Areola somehow keeping out Mohamed Salah's close-range strike at the London Stadium before Christmas.",
      "However, the nod goes to the aforementioned Raya, who helped Arsenal inflict on Aston Villa their only home loss in the league this season with a simply ridiculous second-half stop to keep out Ollie Watkins' header.",
      "The Arsenal No 1 first had to touch Amadou Onana's deflected shot on to the bar, before immediately springing back up to his feet and pushing away to safety the England striker's point-blank header, with Gary Neville exclaiming on commentary: \"How Raya reacts, wow!\"Rich Morgan",
      "A moment that will live forever in history. James Tarkowski crashing in a 98th-minute equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Forty-one wins apiece for Everton and Liverpool at the Grand Old Lady. Forever. Hit play on our video above and drink in those extraordinary scenes again...Peter Smith",

      "A season of profit has been secured for the fifth season running with the best bets advised in the column leading to +18.7. It's been a bumpy ride involving near misses and losing runs but the winners have flowed nicely. A spell of betting against Manchester City at short prices before it was trendy to do so made me look very clever indeed, correctly calling wins for Tottenham (0-4), Bournemouth (2-1) and Brighton (2-1) during City's mid-season wobble was a memorable spell.",
      "There have been longshot treble wins at 10/1 and 14/1 - a particular highlight was Joelinton's card for Newcastle at Aston Villa copping the treble after Brentford beat Brighton and Palace and Bournemouth sailed under the 2.5 goals line in a 0-0 draw.",
      "And we've finished the season strongly, nailing a lovely 10/1 winning angle on 32+ fouls being committed in the Europa League final.Lewis Jones",
      "Learning to accept being wrong is a key part of keeping a sane headspace when it comes to making betting decisions and putting your neck on the line. And I've had plenty of practice this season.",
      "Let's start with Tottenham to finish in the top four and Dominic Solanke to score 20 or more goals shall we at 12/1? Or what about Leif Davis - the Ipswich assist-king of a full back - who I was excited about in the top assist markets in pre-season at 100/1? Just one assist was it Leif? Ah well.",
      "In fact, my reading for most of the season on the newly-promoted teams was downright ugly. Thinking Leicester were a \"barnstorming price\" to beat Everton at Goodison Park at 7/2 quickly went down the drain after just 10 seconds when Abdoulaye Doucoure sent the hosts on their way to the most comfortable 4-0 win you're ever likely to see.Lewis Jones"

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal fired Tottenham to their first trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 Europa League final win over Manchester United.",
      "It was a game - and goal - that was befitting of a clash between the Premier League's 16th and 17th-placed teams, but it was Spurs who finally ended their silverware drought, winning their first title since 2008.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's claim earlier in the campaign that he always wins trophies in his second season has been vindicated. Whether it is enough for him to remain as Spurs manager remains to be seen but the club will be playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "There was a touch of confusion around the goal. Pape Sarr sent in a good cross, with Johnson and Luke Shaw charging for it. The ball pinged between the two before coming off Shaw's arm, sending it goalwards.",
      "The Spurs forward got the lightest of final touches at the near post, sending the sea of white shirts inside the San Mames into raptures.",

      "Casemiro then fired into the side netting as Man Utd ran out of ideas in Bilbao. It means they will have no European football next season and their summer transfers will likely be impacted as a result.",

      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"
