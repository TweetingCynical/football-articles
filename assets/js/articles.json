      "Emi Martinez believes Manchester United have sold a \"little treasure\" in Alejandro Garnacho. Aston Villa goalkeeper Martinez was left out of Unai Emery's squad on Sunday that lost 3-0 to Crystal Palace, with the manager confirming he wasn't \"focused\" on the game due to a possible transfer.",
      "While Ruben Amorim insists he is happy with his options of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, the pace is picking up on the World Cup-winning 'keeper making a last minute move to Manchester. However, Martinez won't be pleased that the Portuguese manager has gotten rid of one of his international teammates, following Garnacho's £40million move to Chelsea.",
      "Back when the young winger made his debut for Argentina in June 2023, the shot-stopper was full of praise for Garnacho's capabilities both on and off the field. Speaking to TyC Sports at the time, he said: \"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot.",
      "\"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "So while Martinez may be saddened by Garnacho's move away from the club he could potentially join in the next few hours, he still has a familiar face in front of him in United's backline. During Argentina's famous World Cup win in 2022, the heroic 'keeper dubbed Lisandro Martinez an \"animal\", as the pair helped their country to their third trophy of its kind - and the first since 1986.",
      "The defender has been out of the United squad with a cruciate knee ligament injury since last season, but is targeting a return to the field after the international break.",
      "Meanwhile, the Villa shotstopper could be the answer to Amorim's problems between the sticks, as both current goalkeepers have failed to impress fans and pundits alike since the start of the season.",
      "Onana has made one appearance for the Red Devils so far this campaign, in the dramatic penalty shootout loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. While the 'keeper did save one spot kick, he failed to keep two goals out of United's net in regular time, and has since been dropped in favour of Bayindir once more.",
      "The Turkish star has started all three of United's Premier League games, but he hasn't instilled confidence with his performances so far. Bayindir has conceded four goals in three matches, including two from a newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Discussing the potential loss of his number one goalkeeper, Emery was as coy as possible as he just named Martinez' replacement, Marco Bizot, repeatedly to the media.",
      "When questioned further on the 32-year-old's absence, he replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent.",
      "\"He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

While deals for Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli and Antony to Real Betis are close to being completed, United are still no closer to moving on £73million winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Roma and Aston Villa have expressed interest in taking Sancho on loan, but United sources have indicated there is a realistic chance the 25-year-old may now remain at Old Trafford beyond deadline day. Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who paid United a £5m penalty fee to renege on a deal to sign him on a permanent basis, and has not played for the Red Devils since a seven-minute cameo in last year's Community Shield.",
      "Expectations were high for the England winger after his money-spinning move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, but he has struggled to rediscover his stunning form that turned heads during his time in Germany.",
      "He's played 83 times for the Red Devils, scoring 12 goals. The beginning of the end for Sancho came in the 2023-24 season when he irked then-boss Erik ten Hag with his training performances and later released a statement denying that was the reason he was dropped from the team.",
      "Sancho was later loaned back to Dortmund and then to Chelsea last season, where he scored five times in 41 outings, but it wasn't enough to secure him a permanent move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Serie A this summer, though moves to both Juventus and Roma have failed to materialise.",
      "United are desperate to offload all of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', but have so far only managed to move on Marcus Rashford to Barcelona on loan and Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea in a £40m permanent switch.",
      "Defender Tyrrell Malacia, Ten Hag's first signing, is in talks with Spanish club Elche about joining them.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has told Manchester United what they will be missing out on after completing a transfer to Chelsea. Garnacho has joined Chelsea in a £40million move from United, where he was pushed out by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The 21-year-old winger fell out with the United boss at the end of last season, having reacted furiously to being left on the bench for the Europa League final. He was then left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season and told he was not in Amorim’s plans for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Garnacho was placed in the ‘bomb squad’ along with fellow unwanted players Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Having been forced to train alone, the Argentina international has now followed Rashford out of the door at Old Trafford and is delighted to be at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Enzo Maresca was key to making the deal happen and it seems there is no love lost between Garnacho and his former club. While he has shared lots of Chelsea content on his social media pages since joining on the weekend, there is no goodbye message to United.",
      "And having contributed 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season, Garnacho was keen to rub their noses in it during his first interview with Chelsea. “I have a winning mentality. I have passion and a big personality. It’s a natural fit with a club like Chelsea, which have just won the Club World Cup,” he said.",
      "“Chelsea are at the top now, and it’s important to fight for the club like the fans deserve. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special – it means we’re the best team in the world!",
      "“It’s not common to have played a lot of games at this age, but it has helped me a lot. I’m only 21 and I have a lot of experience from these different types of games, stadiums and moments.”",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and scored 26 goals in 144 appearances after progressing through the academy. He was once considered the future of the club, having been nurtured by his idol Cristiano Ronaldo and performed impressively at such a young age.",
      "But his falling out with Amorim meant there was no way back and he has signed a seven-year contract at Chelsea. The Blues first showed an interest in January and his agents, Carlos Cambeiro and Quique de Lucas, were spotted at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea feel they have secured a bargain given Garnacho’s youth and potential and he will compete with the likes of Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Tyrique George and Estevao for a place in Maresca’s starting line-up.",

      "Manchester United have finally agreed a deal to sell Antony to Real Betis, with the winger set to return to the club he spend the second half of last season on loan at. Antony joined United from Ajax for an initial £81.3million back in 2022, but has struggled to make much of an impact.",
      "The Brazilian managed just 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions and United are now set to cut their losses. Antony has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim and was keen on a return to Betis after finding form during his loan spell.",
      "Now, after the furore of the weekend, a £21.5m deal has been struck after an agreement was reached over Antony's salary. The deal also includes potential add-ons worth around £2.6m and a clause that will see United bank 50 per cent of any profit Betis make by selling Antony. The 25-year-old is set to take a major pay cut, with the winger having two years left on his £6m-a-year deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The deal hit the skids over the weekend due to money owed to the player on the remaining two years of his deal - with both Betis and United not wanting to pay. United did not want to pay Antony any more money and the club have now got their way. They will make no further payment to the player' with Antony having to do his bit to seal his return to Betis.",

So, for me it was very complicated, but thank God, with the help of my family and mainly with the help of God, I managed to get ahead and today I am very happy here.\"",

      "Unai Emery showed his frustration with Emi Martinez during a bizarre pre-match interview on the eve of transfer deadline day.",
      "Martinez was left out of the Aston Villa squad for their Premier League game against Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid speculation he could leave for Manchester United. The Argentina international has been linked with a transfer all summer and things came to a head on the weekend.",
      "Emery opted to leave Martinez out of the squad entirely, with summer signing Marco Bizot starting in goal. It proved to be an ill-fated decision, with Bizot conceding a penalty for a foul on Daichi Kamada as Palace eased to a 3-0 win at Villa Park.",
      "In awkward scenes, Emery left long pauses as he stuck to his unusual approach. Asked where Martinez was, he replied: \"Marco Bizot!\" Asked whether Bizot would be the Villa goalkeeper going forward, he declined to add anything else, just repeating his name once more before stating \"your time is over\" and walking off.",
      "After the game was over, and Villa had suffered a damaging home defeat, Emery did admit that the situation needed resolving. \"It is not helping us. One of the circumstances not helping,\" he said.",
      "\"We will see how we close the transfer window. We have a lot of circumstances that are not helping us be mentally like we were last year.\"",
      "Asked why Martinez was left out, Emery replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Martinez, United and Villa are in a three-way tussle which also involves Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. United have been in talks with Antwerp over a deal for their 23-year-old goalkeeper. It was reported on Sunday that United had tabled an improved offer for the player ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "But Lammens has also been linked with Villa, who are looking at their options for if Martinez does leave. It is an intriguing situation which has come about largely because of the shaky performances of both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana for United this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has insisted he is happy with his options in between the posts, but United are pursuing a deadline day deal nonetheless. Villa, meanwhile, have been hamstrung by profit and sustainability rules and have been quiet this summer in the window.",

      "Raheem Sterling swapped one London club for another at the last minute in 2024, allowing Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to escape Old Trafford and head to Chelsea. Last year's deadline day was full of surprises in the Premier League, with Chelsea's dramatic dealings sparking plenty of headlines.",
      "Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal, and United saw Sancho and Sterling move to different parts of London on loan for the new campaign. As the transfer window slammed shut, the Blues released a small statement confirming Sterling's departure, which simply read, \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger - who is now 30 years old and back at Stamford Bridge - completed a last-minute loan switch to the Emirates Stadium. This was after it became clear he was not part of manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club throughout the summer.",
      "Chelsea saw another new addition to their squad: the arrival of former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially was swapped in for Sterling. The England international was also left out of then-boss Erik ten Hag's plans at United and had been free to depart either on loan or on a permanent deal.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the chosen location for the young attacker, as United agreed to an obligation to buy price of £23million if certain targets were met. That was a far cry from the £73.5m that the club paid back in the summer of 2021 to lure Sancho to Manchester, but he hardly pulled up trees at Old Trafford, registering just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances, subsequently seeing his stock fall dramatically.",
      "Meanwhile, Sterling was reunited with an old friend at Arsenal; boss Mikel Arteta, who spent a lot of time working under Pep Guardiola during the forward's seven-year tenure with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the end of the 2024/25 season regardless of his impact in north London.",
      "During his time at Arsenal, the forward managed just one goal and assisted five times in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League. Sterling was used sparingly and arguably enjoyed his best game when he helped Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice score in a 2-2 draw with PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's elite competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but ultimately finished the season without silverware and barely any game time before heading back to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho had a more impactful year with Chelsea, scoring five goals and assisting 10 times across 41 appearances both domestically and in Europe. Most of the young winger's goals came in the Premier League, but it was in the knockout stages of the Conference League where he shone the most for the Blues.",
      "After making the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund while on loan in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho made yet another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, and they dispatched the Spanish club in style, winning 4-1 with Sancho scoring the third in the 83rd minute of the game.",
      "However, Chelsea opted not to pay a fee to United to avoid having to trigger Sancho's buyout clause, having failed to be convinced by the winger despite his role in helping them claim silverware.",
      "Now, Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still trying to secure a move away for the winger as he is not part of the Portuguese manager's plans for the future.",
      "Sancho has already turned down moves to Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly wanted by several clubs, while Sterling is also unwanted at Chelsea. With both players in difficult positions at their clubs, there's every chance they could one again be involved in a dramatic deadline day move, and will hope this time they can make more of an impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Few signings will ever match the hype and euphoria Cristiano Ronaldo’s return to Manchester United brought on transfer deadline day. In summer 2021, following the exciting new additions of Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho, United appeared set to suffer a blow as club legend Ronaldo looked to make a return to the Premier League.",
      "The then-36-year-old was strongly linked with a move to neighbours Manchester City. But the Red Devils made a last-ditch intervention with Juventus and Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, while club legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Rio Ferdinand phoned the player to dissuade him from joining City.",
      "What followed was a bombshell announcement that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner had apparently made a U-turn to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side – 12 years after he left for Real Madrid and went on to become one of the greatest players of all time. For many fans, it marked the homecoming of their dreams and represented a return to the old Manchester United, which had been lost since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.",
      "Ronaldo’s sensational return cost an initial £13million, but totalled £38m when factoring in the £385,000-a-week he was paid over the next 64 weeks he spent in Manchester. Despite being a big sum for a player in his mid-30s, it still represented a salary cut on the £500,000-per-week he had received at Juve.",
      "And, simply put, the fans didn’t care as they raced to print the Portuguese icon’s name on the back of their 2021/22 jerseys. The feel-good factor was through the roof. A swashbuckling United led by club legend Solskjaer had finished second the previous season and here they were, adding the most lethal finisher in history to their ranks.",
      "Ronaldo said after his move was announced: “Manchester United is a club that has always had a special place in my heart, and I have been overwhelmed by all the messages I have received since the announcement on Friday.",
      "”I cannot wait to play at Old Trafford in front of a full stadium and see all the fans again. I'm looking forward to joining up with the team after the international games, and I hope we have a very successful season ahead.”",
      "Having initially joined the Old Trafford club in 2003, Ronaldo went from an exciting prospect to a world beater over the next six years, netting more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributing to United securing three Premier League crowns, plus the Champions League.",
      "Upon his return, he was given his iconic No. 7 shirt back and scored on his second debut against Newcastle. More goals followed as he registered 24 in all competitions, but his efforts were in vain as United struggled for form and Solskjaer was sacked early on in his first season.",
      "Ronaldo would play under two interim managers that season in Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick as he visibly grew more and more frustrated at the side's fall from grace. Ronaldo reportedly made attempts to engineer a move elsewhere but failed to do so before the transfer window, while United refused to let him go.",
      "Erik ten Hag’s appointment as permanent boss in the summer of 2022 presented a potential fresh start, until it became clear the Dutchman was not giving his veteran forward any preferential treatment. The Portuguese was omitted from the Manchester derby defeat to rivals Manchester City, which became a huge talking point.",
      "Ten Hag claimed he left Ronaldo on the bench \"out of respect\" as United were 4-0 at half-time, though he later asked Ronaldo to come on as a substitute three minutes before the end of the victory over Tottenham, which the striker refused to do.",
      "Ronaldo then stormed down the tunnel and out of Old Trafford before the final whistle – an incident he admitted he regretted. Ten Hag had responded to that tantrum by suspending him for one fixture before making Ronaldo captain for the next four matches.",
      "However, Ronaldo’s mind was already made and, ahead of the 2022 World Cup, he sat down for a tell-all interview with close friend Piers Morgan on Talk TV, where he blasted both Ten Hag and predecessor Rangnick.",
      "The forward said he had been “betrayed” by United, also claiming Ten Hag had tried to force him out of the club. United responded by terminating his contract, paving the way for his move to current club Al-Nassr in January 2023, and bringing one of the club’s biggest and most exciting signings ever's time to a bitter end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The final day of the transfer market is finally here and it could be hectic few hours for Premier League clubs and beyond. Clubs in the top flight have already spent heavily so far and more could yet be splashed.",
      "Liverpool are in line for an extremely lucrative day. Newcastle have finally opened the door to Alexander Isak's exit, with the Reds agreeing to pay £125million to sign the striker on a six-year deal. The reigning Premier League champions are also after a new centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi right at the top of their list.",
      "Across the north west, Manchester United might be busy. They are after a new goalkeeper, with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez potentially the man set to move to Old Trafford. Outgoings could also be on the cards, with Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and more all primed for exits.",
      "Arsenal could conclude an eye-watering summer with a move for Bayer Leverkusen star Piero Hincapie, with exits also likely.",
      "There are also some tricky situations to solve at both Newcastle and Chelsea. Away from Isak, Newcastle are chasing Yoane Wissa, who has requested to leave Brentford. Finally, the Blues are attempting to welcome two strikers back to Stamford Bridge, with Marc Guiu and Nicolas Jackson potentially being recalled.",
      "The deadline for deals is 7pm this evening, albeit deal sheets could see negotiations carry on until well after that.",
      "Newcastle started the summer transfer window needing to sign two strikers. With Nick Woltemade in, it is one down and two to go.",
      "Alexander Isak's £125million move to Liverpool means the Magpies desperately need more reinforcements - and they have reopened talks with Brentford over Yoane Wissa.",
      "Wissa is extremely keen on the move, but Brentford have rejected bids up to £40m for him so far. With the clock ticking, Newcastle don't have long to agree terms so have upped their offer to £55m, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says Wissa is now on his way to Newcastle for a medical.",
      "Everton are trying to get in a midfielder today as well as other reinforcements.",
      "They're trying to land SC Freiburg midfielder Merlin Rohl. He would cost around £17.5m.",
      "Tariq Lamptey has left Brighton for Fiorentina.",
      "The full-back made 122 appearances for Brighton since joining the club from Chelsea in January 2020.",
      "Manager Fabian Hurzeler said: “We’d like to thank Tariq for his time here at the club. He’s been a valued player throughout his time, but more than that he is a brilliant professional and person.",
      "“This is a good opportunity for him to play both Serie A and European football. On behalf of everyone at the club I’d like to wish him all the very best for the future.”",
      "Manchester United have taken the first step towards signing a new goalkeeper today, with The Athletic reporting that they've agreed personal terms with Senne Lammens.",
      "Lammens has been linked with United all summer and would cost around €25million (£21m). The problem is that they haven't agreed terms with Royal Antwerp - and Lammens needs to get to Manchester to complete a medical as soon as possible, with the deadline looming.",
      "Aston Villa have also been keeping an eye on Lammens in case Emi Martinez goes to United, who want a more reliable goalkeeper than Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir.",
      "Manchester City have agreed a fee with Paris Saint-Germain for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. City's move for Italy international Donnarumma was always dependent on Ederson leaving, and with the Brazilian on his way to Fenerbahce in a deal worth around £12million, City have made their move.",
      "Donnarumma is set for a medical in Manchester today before signing a long-term deal to take over as City's No.1.",
      "James Trafford, who returned to City from Burnley this summer, has started all of their Premier League games this season, with Pep Guardiola's side having suffered back-to-back defeats in a shock poor start to the new campaign.",
      "But Donnarumma will be between the posts for City's next game after the international break – the Manchester derby against local rivals United at the Etihad Stadium on September 14.",
      "Cambridge United are leading the race to sign Adam Mayor from Millwall.",
      "The 20-year-old left winger, who is also capable of playing at left-back, has been given the green light to leave The Den on loan in order to continue his development.",
      "And a move to Cambridge would see Mayor link up with Den legend Neil Harris, who is the U's current head coach.",
      "Cambridge are hoping to beat off competition from other League Two clubs to snap up the former Morecambe star, who moved to Millwall in January 2024.",
      "Liverpool have yet to receive a bid for Harvey Elliott. RB Leipzig are interested in the Reds player as a replacement for Xavi Simons, who joined Tottenham for €60million (£51.8m) last week.",
      "Now Alexander Isak is arriving, there is a chance that Elliott will leave by 7pm tonight.",
      "As well as trying to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper, Manchester United's focus on deadline day will be on clearing the decks with several outgoing deals, writes David McDonnell.",
      "While deals for Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli and Antony to Real Betis are close to being completed, United are still no closer to moving on £73million winger Jadon Sancho.",
      "Roma and Aston Villa have expressed interest in taking Sancho on loan, but United sources have indicated there is a realistic chance the 25-year-old may now remain at Old Trafford beyond deadline day.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who paid United a £5m penalty fee to renege on a deal to sign him on a permanent basis, and has not played for the Red Devils since a seven-minute cameo in last year's Community Shield.",
      "United are desperate to offload all of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', but have so far only managed to move on Marcus Rashford to Barcelona on loan and Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea in a £40m permanent switch.",
      "Defender Tyrrell Malacia, former United boss Erik ten Hag's first signing, is in talks with Spanish club Elche about joining them.",
      "Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain, with Ederson heading to Fenerbahce.",
      "It's all change in between the posts for City, who have already brought back James Trafford this summer from Burnley.",
      "Now Donnarumma has agreed terms with City and will undergo a medical this afternoon, according to Fabrizio Romano. PSG had demanded €50million (£43.2m) for the Italy international, but a compromise has been found.",
      "Meanwhile, Ederson is heading to Turkey for just €14m (£12m), ending his eight-year stay with City.",
      "Liverpool have agreed to pay £125million for Alexander Isak, which is a British transfer record.",
      "It's a fixed fee with no add-ons. Newcastle believe the package to be worth £130m, but that is because of savings they have made on not paying the Sweden striker a loyalty bonus and other payments. Liverpool won't pay any more than £125m now or in the future.",
      "Sunderland are poised to sign RB Leipzig defender Lutsharel Geertruida on loan with an option to buy and have also agreed a deal with Ajax for forward Brian Brobbey.",
      "The 25-year-old Dutchman Geertruida is already in Sunderland and will complete a medical today, according to The Athletic.",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraaf report that Sunderland have agreed to sign Brobbey for €20million (£17m) plus €5m (£4m) in add-ons.",
      "The Black Cats have shown real ambition in the window this summer and will comfortably eclipse Nottingham Forest's figure of £141.5m in 2022 as the highest-spending promoted Premier League side.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie is in London finalising his switch to Arsenal, writes Ryan Taylor.",
      "The deal is a £45million package, an initial loan with a buy-option that can be formally triggered next summer. Arsenal are understood to be optimistic they can complete the deal before the 7pm transfer deadline.",
      "The Ecuador international is expected to be the only Deadline Day arrival and would become the club's eighth summer signing. His arrival will trigger Jakub Kiwior's switch to Porto; the Pole is already in Portugal and has completed his medical tests. The deal is an initial loan but the package is worth up to £23.4m including bonuses.",
      "Midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga has already completed a medical ahead of a permanent switch to Hamburg and he could also be joined by Fabio Vieira (on loan) at the Bundesliga club.",
      "Fulham remain a possible option for Reiss Nelson - that would also be a loan - while Arsenal and Marseille are still speaking about a possible move for Oleksandr Zinchenko, which is complex due to his salary.",
      "Liverpool may be landing Alexander Isak for a British record transfer fee but their pursuit of Marc Guehi is in the balance, writes Chris McKenna.",
      "The Reds bid £35m with a 10 per cent sell on clause for the Crystal Palace defender on Saturday. It has yet to be rejected but Palace have not entered talks.",
      "Palace boss Oliver Glasner is insisting he can’t go but chairman Steve Parish is weighing up whether the club can afford to turn down the fee when the England centre back can leave for nothing next summer.",
      "It could still happen today but it is not guaranteed.",
      "Nayef Aguerd will leave West Ham for Marseille today, according to The Guardian.",
      "Aguerd will join the French side for €23million (£20m), leaving the Hammers to find a replacement today.",
      "Piero Hincapie will become an Arsenal player today, having travelled to London yesterday to complete a medical.",
      "The Bayer Leverkusen defender is joining the Gunners on loan, but his move will become permanent next summer for £45million.",
      "His arrival allows Jakub Kiwior to move to Porto on loan with an obligation to buy for £24m.",
      "Manchester United have been desperate to offload their unwanted players this summer - and their desperation is clear in the sale of Antony to Real Betis.",
      "United signed Antony from Ajax for £81million just two years ago, and are now flogging him to Betis for €25m (£21m) plus a potential €3m (£2.6m) in bonuses, according to The Athletic, who report that they will have a 50 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "They have at least got rid of his wages, but that is quite the loss on the Brazilian winger.",
      "With Alexander Isak heading over to Merseyside today for a medical with Liverpool, Newcastle fans will be awaiting news of a new striker arriving at St James' Park.",
      "The Magpies have been chasing Yoane Wissa all summer, with the Brentford striker increasingly frustrated with his club's stance. Wissa has suggested that the goalposts have been moved, with a £40m fee no longer acceptable and £65m wanted. He remains in limbo today.",
      "Newcastle have also seen bids rejected by Wolves for Jorgen Strand Larsen. They have signed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but really need two strikers after losing Callum Wilson to West Ham on a free transfer.",
      "Manchester United could move to sign a goalkeeper today to fix a problem that has been obvious all summer.",
      "Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have been anything but reliable - and Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is on the cards.",
      "Unai Emery left him out of the Aston Villa squad last night and admitted the situation needed resolving. \"It is not helping us. One of the circumstances not helping,\" he said after Villa lost 3-0 against Crystal Palace.",
      "\"We will see how we close the transfer window. We have a lot of circumstances that are not helping us be mentally like we were last year.\"",
      "Asked why he was left out, Emery replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Liverpool appear to have everything in place for Alexander Isak, but they also want to land Marc Guehi today.",
      "The Crystal Palace captain played and scored in a 3-0 win over Aston Villa last night and his situation appears more complicated.",
      "Palace boss Oliver Glasner has made it clear that he wants to keep Guehi, but with less than a year left on his contract, can they afford to walk away from a £40million deal?",
      "We will wait and see.",
      "It has been widely reported that Liverpool have now agreed a deal with Newcastle to sign Alexander Isak and end the saga of the summer.",
      "This outcome always felt likely, but a Premier League record deal for £130million remains a blockbuster deal.",
      "The Athletic reports that everything is agreed and Isak will undergo a medical today before signing a six-year contract with Liverpool.",
      "The change of stance comes after Newcastle landed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, while they continue to chase another striker - either Brentford's Yoane Wissa, or Wolves' Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "And welcome to what promises to be a busy, busy day of transfers in the Premier League and beyond.",
      "All eyes will be on Liverpool, who are trying to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi."

      "Manchester United could be in line for a busy deadline day this year. A number of exits are on the cards for the Red Devils before the deadline on Monday.",
      "And while some of them could be welcome as Ruben Amorim attempts to guide United back on track, some might not be as accepted as others. That was certainly the case when academy graduate Axel Tuanzebe left the club for Ipswich Town on deadline day in 2023.",
      "The move to Portman Road brought to an end his 17-year association with the Red Devils, having been at the club from the age of eight and progressing through the club’s youth system.",
      "Back in 2015, he won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award while club icon Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made him the club’s youngest-ever captain in a Carabao Cup tie vs Rochdale in 2019.",
      "Speaking at the time, Solskjaer said. \"Axel is a captain in the making, he's a leader. Why not give it to young kids? How does he handle it? He was fine, he enjoyed it. It's just a way of telling him that we trust him.\"",
      "Solskjaer wasn’t the only one aware of Tuanzebe’s leadership abilities. Harry Maguire was also one of those to note his potential to be leader with the Red Devils.",
      "\"We have a lot of leaders in the dressing room, a lot of senior pros,\" Maguire said. \"And you don’t have to be a senior pro to be a leader. Axel is a leader, in the ways that he works and speaks in the dressing room. And he’s only a young boy, he’s still learning his trade. I’m sure he’ll go on to have an unbelievable career.\"",
      "Tuanzebe left Old Trafford having made 37 appearances for the first team, injuries having hugely disrupted his time with the club. And that appears to have been a sticking point for the defender having lodged a legal complaint against his former side for “medical negligence”.",
      "Meanwhile, United appear to have moved on, with Amorim having put together a leadership group over the summer. He said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys now. They are responsible for the group.",
      "\"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them in this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.",

      "Buckle up, Manchester United fans, it's set to be a busy transfer deadline day. With £207.5million spent on their attack, the Red Devils are focussed on bolstering the other end of the pitch before Monday's 7pm cutoff.",
      "United are looking to finish as fast as they started the summer transfer window, having welcomed Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million move from Wolves all the way back on June 1. Cunha's arrival at Old Trafford was followed up by the addition of Bryan Mbeumo, as after weeks of fraught negotiations with Brentford, the Red Devils stumped up a £71m package to land his signature.",
      "After Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko was signed in a deal which could rise to £74m, completing a new-look forward line for Ruben Amorim. Scoring goals from open play has still been an issue in the early stages of the 2025-26 season but's conceding them which has really harmed United.",
      "The Red Devils are yet to keep a clean sheet and the finger has often been pointed at the man between the posts. That's why Amorim wants to sign at least one new goalkeeper - and to finally offload a hoard of unwanted stars.",
      "Here are seven deals which United are looking to complete before the transfer window shuts.",
      "First up, it's United's most glaring issue: goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir has played every Premier League game so far but hasn't been convincing while Andre Onana's performance at Grimsby was nothing shirt of a disaster.",
      "So, the Red Devils have turned to Senne Lammens. An improved bid was sent to Royal Antwerp on Sunday and United hope to complete the signing of the 23-year-old Belgian, with the deal set to cost upwards of £20million.",
      "As a contingency, though, the Red Devils made fresh contact with Aston Villa to discuss Emiliano Martinez, who's already agreed personal terms. The Argentina international, 32, is much more established than Lammens, who could join Villa his a replacement, but would cost significantly more.",
      "Lammens and Martinez aren't the only goalkeepers in United's sights. Abdulla Al-Hammadi, a former Everton trialist, has been on trial at Old Trafford during the summer, training with the club's academy.",
      "The MEN report that 20-year-old Al-Hammadi, who hails from the UAE, has impressed staff and will be an academy signing. Due to being a free agent, Al-Hammadi doesn't need to be signed before the deadline.",
      "After ex-United star Scott McTominay, Rasmus Hojlund wants to be next player to reignite his career at Napoli. Hojlund, 22, is poised to join the Serie A champions on loan for the season, banking United £5m, before a £38m obligation to buy kicks in next summer.",
      "Another Red Devil who reignited his career away from Old Trafford is Antony - but he's still at United. The 25-year-old Brazilian has been holding out for a return to Real Betis all summer, and just as there looked to be light at the end of the tunnel, the Spanish side withdrew their offer.",
      "After Betis went public, it's now a stalemate. \"There is no agreement for Antony and we have withdrawn the offer,\" the club explained. \"We can't afford the fee and the amounts that Manchester United must instead pay the player before the transfer.\"",
      "Unlike Antony, there's been much less talk surrounding the potential departure of Jadon Sancho. Chelsea opted not to sign the English winger permanently and he's now in the final year of his contract.",
      "Roma have been pursuing Sancho, 25, but he hasn't been swayed as of yet. Late on Sunday, it emerged that the ex-Borussia Dortmund star was a target for Villa, who've endured a wretched start to the season.",
      "Speaking of players in the bomb squad - which included the now departed Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho - Tyrell Malacia is seeking a move. Elche entered talks last week but currently nothing is imminent.",
      "Another left-back, Harry Amass, is also due to leave but on a temporary basis. Amass is expected to complete a season-long loan move to Sheffield Wednesday.",

      "United have been in talks with Royal Antwerp over a deal for their 23-year-old goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, with The Telegraph reporting that the club have tabled an improved offer for the player ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "Martinez is an option if a deal for the Belgian cannot be achieved with reports from Europe confirming that the World Cup winner and Manchester United have already reached an agreement on personal terms ahead of a potential switch.",
      "United have decided to step up their pursuit of a new goalkeeper in the wake of poor performances from both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir in the opening weeks of the season.",
      "Martinez wants to leave Villa Park and contact between his representatives and Manchester United has gone back as far as January, per The Athletic. Intriguingly, Villa will move for Lammens if they do sanction an exit for Martinez before the transfer deadline on Monday night.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Aston Villa are said to have made an approach for Manchester United target Senne Lammens with the Red Devils courting both the Belgian and Emi Martinez before Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "United are expected to bring in a new goalkeeper before the window closes with neither Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir convincing in their appearances so far this season. Talks over a deal for Lammens have been ongoing but it emerged over the weekend that United had rekindled their interest in Martinez, though they will only sign one.",
      "Martinez, 32, was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford earlier in the summer. It was reported on Sunday that United have, in fact, now approached their Premier League rivals over a possible transfer, with an agreement on personal terms already in place. At the same time, news of an approach from Villa emerged.",
      "The Telegraph have since outlined that United have returned to the table with a new offer for Lammens, who they claim is the Red Devils' preferred target to come in and compete with Onana and Bayindir.",
      "The 23-year-old is highly regarded in Belgium by both club and country and has also attracted interest from Galatasaray. He is keen on the idea of moving to Old Trafford, though, if a deal can be done in the next 36 hours.",
      "While Lammens is likely to cost in excess of £20million, that is around half of the £40m that Villa would likely demand to part with Martinez. United have spent in excess of £200m on new attackers this summer as they bid to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign last year.",
      "Bayindir has started all three of United's games in the Premier League so far this season but has been at fault for goals against Arsenal and Fulham. Onana, meanwhile, did not cover himself in glory with a poor display in midweek when United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "Villa could also be active on the final day of the transfer window; they were linked with Lucas Pacqueta on Saturday night and there were even suggestions the attacking midfielder would not feature in their game against Nottingham Forest on Sunday, though he went on to start for Graham Potter's side.",

      "It has been reported that Eamonn Holmes has pulled out his ace card in a bid to keep his relationship with Katie Alexander on track after the couple hit their first obstacle in their relationship. According to reports, the couple hit their first stumbling block after Eamonn reportedly pulled out of purchasing a £550,000 semi-detached house in West Yorkshire.",
      "The couple allegedly started dating back in August last year.",
      "And so, in a desperate bid to ease her disappointment, Eamonn has been lavishing her with a number of luxury treats.",

      "A source told the newspaper: \"Eamonn and Katie didn’t always look blissfully happy at the football, but at least they showed they are still an item. Eamonn’s moody face later might have been due to United conceding an equaliser to Fulham - denying his team a much needed win. The Northern Ireland air will have cheered him up for sure.\"",

      "Manchester United have confirmed a loan exit for young forward Ethan Williams. The teenager has signed a new deal at Old Trafford, extending his contract until 2028 before completing a season-long move to Falkirk.",
      "Williams took part in United's pre-season tour, scoring in a 4-1 friendly victory over Bournemouth. He spent the second half of last season on loan at Cheltenham, netting twice, and now faces a year in the Scottish top-flight.",
      "“We’re absolutely delighted to bring Ethan Williams to Falkirk,\" the Scottish club's manager John McGlynn said. He confirmed former United centre-back Jonny Evans played a part in the move, having taken on a new role at Old Trafford since his summer retirement.",
      "\"He’s a young player of real quality who has been developed in one of the best academies in the world at Manchester United, and he now has the chance to take the next step in his career with us,\" McGlynn added. \"Ethan is quick, direct, and has an eye for goal, qualities that we feel will add a different dimension to our attacking play and excite the supporters.",
      "“Ethan is a player we’ve had our eye on for some time, we were chasing this deal before the window even opened. It’s been a long road getting him to Falkirk with plenty of twists and turns along the way, but we always felt it was worth persevering with and we’re delighted to finally get it over the line.\"",
      "He joins a growing list of United stars to complete loan moves away from Old Trafford. Marcus Rashford is spending the season at Barcelona, with Toby Collyer at West Brom and Ethan Wheatley at Northampton.",
      "\"Last term, he did well with Cheltenham Town in League Two, scoring his first goals in senior football,\" United said in a statement about Williams once the loan was announced. \"A new experience awaits him north of the border, after a deal was concluded with the Bairns.\"",
      "There are still a few more deals left to be wrapped up. Among those is another loan, wit Rasmus Hojlund on the verge of trading Manchester for Napoli on loan with a view to a permanent switch next summer, and Alejandro Garnacho has now made a permanent move from United to Chelsea.",
      "United are also still working to complete a deal for Antony to return to Real Betis. The teams are a little apart on the financial terms, specifically concerning a potential payment to the Brazilian to make up for his wage drop.",
      "\"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer,\" the Spanish club said in a statement on Friday. The winger thrived on loan at the club last season, but a permanent move - for a fee of around £21.6million - now hangs in the balance.",

      "Manchester United are still pushing to sign a goalkeeper before Monday night's transfer deadline – with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez one of their targets.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants an upgrade on Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, with Martinez and Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens having emerged as the two contenders for the No.1 spot. It is understood Argentina World Cup winner Martinez is preferred because of his greater experience, particularly in the Premier League, which is why United are pushing hard for him.",
      "There have been unconfirmed suggestions that Martinez has been left out of Villa's squad for tonight's Premier League encounter at home to Crystal Palace, ahead of his potential exit.",
      "Villa would want around £40million for Martinez, while Lammens, 23, would cost United in the region of £20m, which is a major consideration for United, against the backdrop of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Martinez turns 33 next week and selling him to United would help Villa in their compliance with PSR and they are understood to be willing to cash in on their experienced keeper if a fee meets their valuation of him.",
      "Onana, who cost United £43m from Inter Milan in 2023, was at fault in United's shock EFL Cup exit at Grimsby in midweek, while Bayindir has also struggled in his outings against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Former United defender Victor Lindelof, who left at the end of last season when his contract expired, is understood to be on the verge of joining Villa.",

He played nearly 300 games for the club, winning both domestic cups and making the squad for the Europa League final defeats in 2021 and 2025.",

      "Erik ten Hag could pay the ultimate price for his poor start to life at Bayer Leverkusen amid claims in Germany that the Bundesliga outfit have already decided to axe the former Manchester United manager.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, signed a contract until 2027 back in May after being selected to succeed Xabi Alonso, who guided Leverkusen to their first ever German title. Ten Hag always had big shoes to fill with Alonso moving onto pastures new - but it now seems the 'experiment' of appointing the Dutchman may be over before it could even get going.",
      "After watching Leverkusen twice blow a lead in their 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen on Saturday, Kicker claim that the club's top brass may shortly take nuclear action with last year's Bundesliga runners-up winless after their opening two league games.",
      "It's noted that there was no statement in support of Ten Hag either before or after Saturday's match, where Werder Bremen struck in the 94th minute to deny Leverkusen victory.",
      "Furthermore, there has been 'criticism' of Ten Hag internally with Leverkusen planning to review their head coach's future after the transfer window closes on Monday, with the report going on to suggest that Simon Rolfes and Co have 'probably already made up their minds'.",
      "Such a move would represent a significant blow for Ten Hag, whose reputation was bruised by a turbulent final few months at Old Trafford. He was expected to be sacked despite winning the FA Cup in his final full season at the helm, only to be handed a contract extension. He was then removed from his post before the end of October after another chastening run of form.",
      "Speaking after Saturday's late collapse against Bremen, Ten Hag said: “The players aren’t ready. We have a new team and some of the players aren’t at all fit enough to play. The team didn’t function at all during the final stage of the game. That’s just the way it is. They need to bring more intensity and get fitter in order to meet my standards.",

      "Bardghji's biggest moment came against Manchester United during the Champions League group stage in November 2023. After United blew a 3-2 lead in the Danish capital, contributing to the Red Devils' early exit that season, the Sweden youth international came off the bench and scored a stunning goal to win the game for Copenhagen.",
      "A serious knee injury kept Bardghji out for most of last season, returning in March after 334 days on the sidelines. Barcelona snapped him up in July, yet their financial problems have led to a tumultuous start to his career in Catalunya.",
      "Due to La Liga's salary cap rules, Barca have struggled to register players, as they've needed to offload first. Club chiefs recently took advantage of a rule which allows them to use some of injured captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen's wages in order to sign-off on players.",
      "After Ter Stegen agreed to the move following an ugly dispute with Barcelona officials, United loanee Marcus Rashford and new goalkeeper Joan Garcia were registered the day before their opening game of the season at Mallorca, a 3-0 win. No new players were registered in time for last Sunday's 3-2 victory over Levante.",
      "But this week, ahead of Barca's third league game away to Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, the departures of Oriol Romeu and Inaki Pena have allowed Wojciech Szczesny and Gerard Martin - two players who were regulars in Hansi Flick's squad last term - to finally be registered. That leaves Bardghji as the only exception.",

      "Ruben Amorim is on the verge of breaking a Manchester United golden rule that has lasted almost 90 years. Woven into the fabric of the Red Devils’ history and club culture is the production line of academy talents into the first team.",
      "Following the countless names to make the step, the Class of ‘92 were the most famous group of players to ascend, having a seismic impact on English football. Even in the period since those glory years, England internationals like Danny Welbeck, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford showed that Carrington can still produce high-quality youngsters.",
      "As such, United have managed to maintain an astonishing tradition that is the envy of rival clubs, by including an academy graduate in every first-team squad since October 1937. However, that record now appears vulnerable.",
      "Following Rashford’s move to Barcelona, Alejandro Garnacho’s Chelsea transfer and veteran Jonny Evans’ retirement, Kobbie Mainoo is one of the only players in the current squad to have come through the academy alongside Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson - and was the only one who featured in Saturday's 3-2 win over Burnley.",
      "But even the 20-year-old has now been linked with an exit due to Amorim’s lack of faith in the midfielder. Mainoo was once considered a key component of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons.",
      "The youngster racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago. He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner.",
      "But, under Amorim, Mainoo has started just 16 games over the past two seasons. Having been left on the bench for two successive Premier League matches, Mainoo finally played in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "He had not played a minute of Premier League football this season before coming on as a half-time substitute in the 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday. That led to frustration on the youngster’s part.",
      "It was recently reported that Serie A champions Napoli were interested in offering the £50million-rated Mainoo a four-year contract. Having seen former United team-mate Scott McTominay make the same move 12 months ago and enjoy huge success, Mainoo reportedly told United bosses he wants to leave on a permanent deal ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "Despite United’s negotiations over an extension to his current contract having stalled, the club opted to block his move to Serie A. And Amorim has been vocal about his desire for Mainoo to stay and fight for his place in the team, showing his reluctance to part ways with the team’s last academy graduate.",
      "The Portuguese said in his press conference ahead of the clash with Burnley: \"I want Kobbie to stay. He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "While a section of fans have expressed concern on social media over United’s long-standing tradition potentially coming to an end, some are unfussed, believing the team’s performances should be a priority.",
      "Should Mainoo get his last-minute move to Napoli, United would still have veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton among their ranks to select for the matchday squad in order to preserve the tradition.",
      "But the 39-year-old, who featured for the academy between 2002 and 2005, is currently behind Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir in the pecking order, while United are reportedly eyeing a last-minute deal for either Emi Martinez or Senne Lammens, meaning the record is likely to be broken with Mainoo’s departure - unless a new academy starlet suddenly emerges.",

      "Aston Villa are interested in signing Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho amid United's own interest in goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Martinez, 32, has been itching to join United for several months and the club received short shrift from a loan enquiry earlier in the summer.",
      "The MEN revealed in January United were considering options to bolster their goalkeeper department and Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp is another target.",
      "Roma have been the frontrunners to sign Sancho for a number of weeks but have failed to secure a breakthrough in discussions.",
      "Sancho, 25, had identified Italy as his likeliest escape route and held talks with Juventus earlier in the summer but Villa have emerged as a possible option.",
      "Martinez and Sancho are on similar wages, with the former on £200,000-a-week. Sancho’s is roughly the same due to the Champions League penalty clause that reduces a United player's salary by 25% if they fail to qualify for the competition.",
      "World Cup-winning 'keeper Martinez was left out of the Villa squad for their 3-0 home thrashing by Crystal Palace on Sunday. Villa coach Unai Emery admitted Martinez was not focused. Villa have struggled to strengthen their squad this summer and are winless after their first three Premier League games.",
      "Sancho has not made a Premier League appearance for United in more than two years. Chelsea paid a £5million penalty fee not to sign Sancho at the end of his season-long loan last term.",
      "The winger has entered the final ten months of his United deal and the club will almost certainly not trigger the one-year extension if Sancho is still under contract.",
      "Sancho also left United for Chelsea on deadline day last year.",

      "Manchester United youngster Ethan Ennis is set to join Fleetwood Town on a season-long loan.",
      "Ennis spent the last six months of last term on loan with Doncaster Rovers as they secured promotion from League Two. He will now join Fleetwood on a season-long deal.",
      "The youngster will be available to make his Fleetwood debut on Tuesday night and there is no option to make the move permanent included in the deal. Plymouth Argyle made an offer to sign Ennis on loan for 2025/2026, but the decision was made to sign for Fleetwood ahead of the transfer deadline.",
      "Ennis was given a new two-year United contract last summer as his previous deal expired in 2025.",
      "Although Ennis has played in each attacking position for the academy, it's thought his long-term future will be on the left wing and he is building a reputation as a goalscoring winger.",
      "Ennis began his career with rivals Liverpool, but he was signed by United in the summer of 2021 and he was the standout signing for the academy in an otherwise quiet window.",
      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "However, disaster struck in August 2022 when it was confirmed that he'd ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. Ennis faced a long road to recovery after that injury but he made up for lost time after that 14-month lay-off and has quickly got back to his best.",
      "The Cheshire-born youngster scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will be active in the transfer market on the final day of the summer window.",
      "The window opened at the beginning of June before briefly closing due to the Club World Cup. United have conducted the majority of their business, but there is still work to do on the final day.",
      "The deadline is 7pm today, which is a four-hour shift from the traditional 11pm closure.",
      "Here are the deals United could complete on transfer deadline day:",
      "Lammens has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. The goalkeeper has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Galatasaray have been linked with a move for the Belgian shot-stopper ahead of the deadline.",
      "United admire Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who could be a potential alternative to Lammens, but the Argentina international earns £200,000 per week at Villa Park.",
      "United did not budget for the signing of a first-choice goalkeeper at the start of the window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has watched Altay Bayindir make mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby and made an error for their second goal.",
      "At the time of writing, Rasmus Hojlund's move to Napoli has yet to be confirmed. He is leaving on a season-long loan, with the obligation to make it permanent included.",
      "United will receive a €6million (£5.2m) loan fee for Hojlund and €44m (£38m) next summer when the obligation, which depends on certain conditions, is triggered.",
      "Hojlund will reunite with Scott McTominay at the Italian champions.",
      "Will Antony complete his transfer to Real Betis? The Brazilian has held out for a move to Betis all summer after his loan last season, but the Spanish club have struggled to finance a deal.",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "It seemed like a deal was already agreed last Friday. Reports indicated a bid had been accepted and the terms of a permanent transfer had been agreed, but Betis released a formal statement saying: \"Betis has retired its offer. Betis cannot afford a transfer fee, nor the amounts the player is supposed to receive.\"",
      "It feels like there could be another twist with Antony and Betis before the transfer deadline.",
      "Last month, Roma contacted United to discuss a loan move for Sancho with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italians could not agree on personal terms with the winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic with his expectations for his next destination.",
      "United shifted Sancho at the eleventh hour last summer and it could go down to the wire again.",
      "Malacia recently celebrated his 26th birthday and interest has been sparse following his loan with PSV, but Spanish club Elche have been credited with late interest in the Dutch defender.",
      "Zachary Baumann is set to leave on a permanent transfer before the deadline, while Sam Mather could be on the move (potentially permanently) after attracting interest.",
      "Ethan Ennis is set to leave on loan - there is a choice between Fleetwood Town and Plymouth - and Rhys Bennett should head out. Ethan Williams completed a loan move to Falkirk on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Harry Amass is set to complete a season-long loan move to Sheffield Wednesday.",

      "And while Manchester United's dismal Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby perhaps signified just how far away Ruben Amorim's side are from challenging for the biggest trophies, the point still stands when it comes to United's prospects in the Premier League this term.",
      "United's current first and second choice goalkeepers, Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, have proven themselves not to be reliable options.",
      "Both have produced a number of error-strewn displays during their time at the club and both have been culpable for goals already this season that have cost United.",
      "Bayindir flapped badly at Declan Rice's corner in United's opening game of the season against Arsenal to allow Riccardo Calafiori to head home the simplest of goals. United were largely the better team but were punished by a bad goalkeeping error.",
      "Onana then followed suit against Grimsby where he was at fault for both goals as the League Two side dumped United out in the second round of the League Cup.",
      "In the Premier League, United's performances have largely been positive. But unless they make a change in goal, they will continue to drop points.",
      "As such, as we head into the final hours of the transfer window on deadline day today, United have to act and bring in a new goalkeeper.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United transfer news on deadline day.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men have been busy in the summer transfer window. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have all bolstered United's attack, with Diego Leon also arriving.",
      "With the transfer window closing on Monday evening at 7pm BST, the Reds are understood to be looking for a new goalkeeper. Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens and Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez are both on their radar.",
      "A move is likely to cast further uncertainty over the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir. United had also been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper now appears set for Manchester City.",
      "Several exits could also be sanctioned with Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund all potentially completing moves away from Old Trafford.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford. You can also click here to sign up to our FREE WhatsApp service and receive updates straight to your phone.",
      "There's been a lot of noise around Kobbie Mainoo over the last week but it's another case of less is more when covering his future. Nothing has changed from what Ruben Amorim said on Friday. United would have under nine hours to sign a midfield replacement and, at this stage, it is improbable that they would decide to let Mainoo go when they have been digging their heels in.",
      "Mainoo also played one-and-a-half games last week, having been unused in the opening two matches. He failed his test of nerve by seeking a loan move but figures at United sympathise with his situation, despite his inability to get into the worst United team in 51 years.",
      "Speaking to some United fans, they've taken a dim view of Mainoo. An interesting sub-plot is whether United will continue to allow his agent, David Lockwood, a route to representing some of their academy players. That is causing a minor issue with some in the agency industry.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is said to be having a medical this afternoon before signing for Manchester City.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims a deal is done and Ederson has signed for Fenerbahce. A long-term deal was reportedly agreed on weeks ago, but now the clubs have also agreed on the transfer.",
      "Senne Lammens is said to be expecting the go-ahead from United to fly in the coming hours.",
      "The journalist Sacha Tavolieri claims personal terms are 99% agreed, but United still reputedly have no agreement with Royal Antwerp. However, Aston Villa and Galatasaray are said to have a deal in place with the Belgian club.",
      "Injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are said to have only strengthened the stance of Ruben Amorim on wanting Kobbie Mainoo to stay.",
      "The BBC claims sources close to the player acknowledge that the potential of doing a deal is slim at this late stage in the transfer window.",
      "During a press conference last night, Unai Emery explained why Emi Martinez did not play for Aston Villa:",
      "We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't.",
      "Asked whether he wants to keep the goalkeeper, Emery replied:",
      "I want Marco Bizot, a young player, Emi Martinez or another.",
      "United are said to have kept their talks over Senne Lammens active despite talks continuing over Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims that Lammens is who Villa will target if Martinez moves.",
      "Both goalkeepers could be moving to Premier League clubs today, but who will they go to?",
      "Antony is reportedly set to have a medical ahead of a move to Real Betis.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the deal is £19million plus £2.6million in add-ons with United retaining a 50% sell-on clause on profit from any future sale.",
      "The expectation is that Kobbie Mainoo will stay at United, as per BBC Sport, despite the midfielder wanting a loan move.",
      "They also report that Antony will have a medical after Real Betis and United agreed to a permanent deal worth almost £22million.",
      "Negotiations between United and Villa over a deal for Sancho are ongoing.",
      "MEN Sport understands Villa are interested in signing Sancho amid United's own interest in goalkeeper Martinez.",
      "A swap deal is unlikely, but with Martinez and Sancho on similar wages, if United can shift the winger then a move for the Villa golakeeper could be on.",
      "Read here >>>",
      "The deal for Antony is reportedly worth £19million plus £2.6million.",
      "The journalist Ben Jacobs also claims that the sell-on clause is 50%-net, so only any profit Real Betis make should they make from any future sale. As reported by The Athletic earlier, United will not subsidise the player's wage drop.",
      "Emi Martinez has reportedly told Aston Villa he wants to join United.",
      "The journalist Fabrizio Romano claims that the message was made clear again after their 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace last night, in which Martinez did not feature. United are already said to have an agreement on personal terms.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are still said to expect Gianluigi Donnarumma to move to Manchester City.",
      "The Athletic, however, stop short of reporting that there is any agreement in place for Ederson yet. They still describe that as a 'potential deal' worth around £12million that City are ready to sanction.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma seemingly will sign for Manchester City today, with there now said to be a verbal agreement in place for Ederson to join Fenerbahce.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims personal terms are agreed with a fee of around 12million.",
      "United are said to have agreed a deal with Real Betis over a permanent move for Antony.",
      "The Athletic reports that the winger will not receive a termination payment. The deal is worth almost £22million and includes a 50% sell-on clause. Betis initially wanted a loan, but the clubs have now compromised.",
      "Good morning, United fans! Transfer deadline day is finally here, and it looks like being a busy one for United.",
      "Aston Villa vice-captain Emiliano Martinez is the talk of Old Trafford as the Reds look for a new goalkeeper.",

The Owls were handed a transfer embargo for their failure to pay players and staff, but the embargo has been lifted and Amass should receive consistent starts in 2025/26.",

      "Manchester United are pushing to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes for business on Monday at 7pm. Doubts over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have led to Ruben Amorim exploring other options.",
      "Throughout the window, Emiliano Martinez and Senne Lammens have been linked with moves to Old Trafford. A loan offer for Martinez was understood to be rejected previously before their attention turned to Lammens.",
      "Now, with less than 48 hours of the window remaining, United's search for a new number one has taken a number of twists and turns. On Sunday morning, it was suggested that Martinez would be prioritised, with personal terms not believed to be an issue, before other outlets suggested Lammens is the number one target.",
      "Both players are understood to be open to joining the club before the window slams shut. But with contrasting reports, who will United go for? Our writers share their verdict on who they think should be prioritised.",
      "I actually don't think this is as close as it may seem. United need a goalkeeper who is one of the best, someone who is going to immediately replace Onana and Bayindir. Martinez is that.",
      "Everything that has been said around Lammens points towards him being a competitor for the number one spot. Martinez comes in ready to take the shirt immediately.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper is one of the best at shot-stopping and being a presence inside his box. Too many times has Ruben Amorim been let down by his goalkeeper, and it's a feeling that Unai Emery hasn't had many times with Martinez.",
      "His age is a slight concern, but there's nothing stopping him from being the new Edwin van der Sar and drastically improving the numbers.",
      "I think that United need to sign a proven Premier League goalkeeper before Monday's 7pm deadline. It's clear that Bayindir and Onana are both not good enough for the Reds, meaning Amorim's side have got to dip into the market for a new No.1.",
      "While there is no doubt that Senne Lammens is a talent and has a lot of potential, I think that Emiliano Martinez would be the most ideal candidate at this stage. With 197 Premier League appearances under his belt, Martinez has cemented himself as an elite top-flight shot-stopper.",
      "As well as this, Martinez is a World Cup winner and has won the Yashin Trophy in the past two years, and I think he is the right calibre of goalkeeper that United need to target. Even though Martinez is 33 on Tuesday, I still believe United should still sign him, as they need a new 'keeper NOW.",
      "United should prioritise neither Emiliano Martinez nor Senne Lammens and go for Gianluigi Donnarumma. The latter is just years older than Lammens, with the former six months his senior.",
      "Donnarumma seems destined for Manchester City, but it has appeared that way for weeks, and Ederson remains at the club with James Trafford still between the sticks. United appears a better stylistic fit for the Italy international; such are the demands of being Pep Guardiola's goalkeeper.",
      "Wages presumably would be an issue, as they likely are for Martinez, but being able to move on from Onana would offset some of that outlay. Donnarumma could be United's goalkeeper for the next decade, much like David de Gea once was, who also received significant remuneration from the club.",
      "In the long term, signing Martinez for a few seasons before requiring a replacement. Gambling on Lammens and potentially needing an alternative in two years could also become more expensive without even considering the on-pitch impact.",

      "Raheem Sterling traded one London club for another in a last-minute switch in 2024, paving the way for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to make his escape to Chelsea.",
      "The previous year's deadline day was rife with Premier League surprises, with the Blues' dramatic transfer activity making plenty of headlines. Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal and United saw Sancho and Sterling relocate to different parts of London on loan for the new season.",
      "As the transfer window closed, the Blues issued a brief statement confirming Sterling's departure that read: \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger, who is now back at Stamford Bridge and has since turned 30, completed a last-minute loan move to the Emirates Stadium. This occurred after it became apparent that he was not in manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club over the summer.",
      "Chelsea welcomed another new face to their squad: former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially replaced Sterling. The England international had also been left out of then-manager Erik ten Hag's plans at United and was free to leave either on loan or permanently.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the young forward's preferred destination, with Chelsea agreeing to an obligatory purchase price of £23million if certain targets were achieved.",
      "This was a stark contrast to the hefty £73.5m that the club shelled out in the summer of 2021 to entice Sancho to Manchester.",
      "However, his performances at Old Trafford were underwhelming. He scored only 12 goals and provided six assists in 83 appearances, causing his value to plummet significantly.",
      "In the meantime, Sterling found himself back with an old acquaintance at Arsenal; manager Mikel Arteta, who had spent considerable time working under Pep Guardiola during Sterling's seven-year stint with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, regardless of his impact at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "During his spell at Arsenal, the forward scored just once and provided five assists in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League.",
      "Sterling was used sparingly but arguably had his best match when he assisted Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice in a 2-2 draw against PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's premier competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but he ultimately ended the season without any trophies and rarely played before returning to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sancho had a standout year with Chelsea, netting five goals and providing 10 assists across 41 appearances in domestic and European competitions. The young winger's most notable performances came in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Conference League.",
      "After reaching the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund during his loan spell in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho found himself in another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, where they triumphed over the Spanish side in a resounding 4-1 victory, with Sancho scoring the third goal in the 83rd minute.",
      "Despite his contributions to their trophy-winning campaign, Chelsea chose to pay a fee to United to avoid triggering Sancho's buyout clause, seemingly unconvinced by the winger's performances.",
      "Sancho now finds himself part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still attempting to facilitate a move for the winger who doesn't feature in the Portuguese manager's future plans.",
      "Sancho has already rejected offers from Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly on the radar of several clubs, while Sterling also finds himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea. With both players in precarious positions at their respective clubs, there's every possibility they could be involved in another dramatic deadline day move but will no doubt hope to make a greater impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",

      "Chido Obi recently removed Manchester United from his bio on Instagram.",
      "The removal of the club's name could be completely insignificant, but followers of the academy have suggested it could be a hint at frustration with a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "The best way to respond to that disappointment is to score for the academy and Obi notched his second goal of the campaign to open the scoring against Manchester City Under-21s.",
      "The Manchester clubs clashed at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday afternoon, which felt like the appetiser for the proper Manchester derby at the Etihad following the international break.",
      "Maybe Obi thought throughout the summer that he would have a chance of being involved in such occasions this season. The youngster made eight first-team appearances last term, he outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the post-season trip and travelled to the United States for pre-season.",
      "Obi started against Leeds in Stockholm and made a further two appearances from the bench in the USA, but Ruben Amorim has not named the young striker in any of his matchday squads this season.",
      "The 17-year-old must earn his stripes for first-team involvement. He made a strong impression last term in difficult circumstances, but it was obvious that he still had a long way to go with his development.",
      "Obi may look at Max Dowman (15) and Ethan Nwaneri (18) at his former club Arsenal and notice that Mikel Arteta has permanently promoted both of those players to his senior squad.",
      "Every situation is different, and Obi must knuckle down to impress Amorim with his performances for the U21s. He struggled to get involved for large parts of the first half against City in the mini-Manchester derby and received an earful from the newly appointed assistant manager, David Horseman.",
      "\"Go on Chido, inside shoulder,\" Horseman shouted at one stage to encourage Obi to press his opponent. Obi was drifting through the contest, but showed just before half-time why he is such a talent.",
      "Obi pounced on Divine Mukasa's indecision around the City penalty area. The youngster still had work to do, but impressively skipped into the box to finish brilliantly beyond City goalkeeper Jack Wint.",
      "Strikers who are worth their salt only need a single chance to finish and Obi has admirable instincts in the box. Some players must work tirelessly on their finish technique, but it comes naturally to Obi.",
      "United were fortunate to have a 1-0 advantage by the interval. City created excellent chances in the first 30 minutes, but couldn't find a breakthrough and their wastefulness was punished.",
      "\"Why did he shoot so early,\" City manager Ben Wilkinson vented on the touchline when Justin Oboavwoduo failed to keep his cool after a poor back pass from Jaydan Kamason.",
      "Wilkinson looked understandably disappointed as he returned to the dressing room for the break. City couldn't make their dominance count and the momentum shift continued when play resumed again.",
      "United were hugely improved at the beginning of the second half, seemingly energised following a discussion with Binnion. Sam Mather came close to scoring on the left and James Scanlon's shot flashed inches wide.",
      "Then Shea Lacey was introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald to make his first U21 appearance. The supremely talented youngster almost made an immediate impact with a volley from the edge of the box, but it was saved.",
      "City counter-attacked moments later to equalise through Reigan Heskey. Both sons of Emile Heskey started for City, while Darren Fletcher's twins started for United, which was a subplot to make fans feel old.",
      "Binnion reacted by introducing Amir Ibragimov. The youngster played a full 90 minutes for the Under-18s on Saturday and was not only fine to play again - but scored the match winner.",
      "Lacey played a wonderful cross into the box to find Ibragimov at the back post to wrap up an impressive Manchester derby victory. United fans will be hoping for the same result when the first-team play after the break.",

      "Manchester United won 3-2 against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim was placed under huge pressure after losing to Grimsby Town earlier in the week, and knew he needed to secure a win against the Clarets ahead of the international break.",
      "Burnley thought they would leave Old Trafford with a point having twice equalised, but Amad was brought down in added time to win a penalty. Bruno Fernandes converted and Old Trafford breathed a sigh of relief at the whistle.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the game. Banners and flags were unfurled, and one flag had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction after Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the text. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around,\" to the tune of Bonnie Tyler.",
      "Amorim sounded like he was close to tendering his resignation after the Grimsby defeat. Some fans voiced understandable concerns about the 40-year-old, but he still retains support from matchgoing fans.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee quickly picked up the ball while VAR decided whether to award a late penalty to United. The Dutchman handed it over to Fernandes, who paced around the box as he tried to focus his mind.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham last weekend and atoned for that miss to secure an important three points. It was only a win against Burnley, but it was crucial after the Grimsby debacle.",
      "United's captain screamed in relief at full-time and was embraced by Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had enough chances to put the result beyond doubt in the first half. But they never make it easy for themselves and could not extend their advantage.",
      "Burnley equalised in the 55th minute, but Mbeumo produced an immediate response to score his first league goal for United. Mbeumo was mobbed by his attacking colleagues, while Amorim did not raise a smile. He knew there was more work to do and buried his head in his hands shortly afterwards when Fernandes dragged a shot wide.",
      "United's head coach knew his side needed a two-goal lead because, more often than not, they allow their opponent back into the contest. And Amorim's fears were realised when Jaidon Anthony scored to make it 2-2.",
      "The cameras in the press box showed Omar Berrada looking unhappy in the directors' box. Amorim subsequently blew out his cheeks and could hardly watch as Fernandes stepped up to convert a late penalty.",
      "Shortly after United opened the scoring against Burnley, Cunha went down with an injury.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee were sent to warm up. Cunha returned to the dressing room with what seemed to be a hamstring issue and was consoled by the substitutes at the tunnel entrance.",
      "Cunha was applauded by supporters as he headed down the tunnel and his body language hinted he might be out for several weeks, which would be a huge blow for United.",
      "The Brazilian has made a strong impression since signing from Wolves. It felt like only a matter of time before Cunha would score his first United goal, but it seems he will be unavailable in the coming weeks.",
      "Mount had a brilliant five minutes in the first half. He tracked back to recover the ball to create a chance for Mbeumo and did the same moments later when setting up the Cameroon international again.",
      "Mbeumo came close to scoring on both occasions but could not find the back of the net, so Mount took matters into his own hands minutes later and made a piercing run into the Burnley penalty area.",
      "Kyle Walker appeared to bring Mount to the ground and the referee pointed for a penalty. Mount celebrated winning the spot kick to the Stretford End, but his celebrations were premature.",
      "The incident was reviewed by VAR. The referee announced it was not a foul when the presumption was it had been reviewed to determine whether it was a penalty or a free-kick. It was a bizarre decision from VAR and Mount deserved something for his good work.",
      "Mount was excellent in the first half but was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval. Mount must have picked up an injury because, based on his performance, Amorim wouldn't have brought him off.",
      "Mainoo's future has made headlines this week. The youngster's contract situation has stalled and there are doubts about where he fits into Amorim's system, so it's not a surprise that he wants to leave on loan.",
      "The academy graduate wants minutes and Amorim has said he is challenging Fernandes for a place in the starting team. Fans are concerned that Mainoo could eventually leave on a permanent basis and Old Trafford gave a deliberately loud cheer for the 20-year-old when he was introduced.",

      "Erik ten Hag is reportedly on the brink of being dismissed by Bayer Leverkusen after just two league matches, according to German media. The Bundesliga giants had appointed former Manchester United manager Ten Hag as a replacement for Xabi Alonso ahead of the new season, but he has struggled to make an impact, with the 2024 champions yet to secure a league victory.",
      "Ten Hag's tenure began with a win over fourth-tier side Sonnenhof Grossaspach in the first round of the DFB-Pokal. However, his team suffered a narrow defeat to Hoffenheim, who staged a comeback to clinch a 2-1 victory following Jarell Quansah's early goal.",
      "Leverkusen then squandered a two-goal lead against Werder Bremen on Saturday, ultimately settling for a 3-3 draw.",
      "Kicker has reported that Ten Hag's position is under serious threat, just three months after his appointment. The situation is described as 'extremely critical', with the Dutchman believed to be under intense internal scrutiny.",
      "Club officials are expected to make a definitive decision on Ten Hag's future once the summer transfer window closes. This suggests that he could be sacked as early as Monday evening, although Leverkusen have not yet announced their final decision.",
      "This development follows Ten Hag's harsh criticism of his players after their draw with Wolfsburg, where he urged them to take responsibility for their disappointing start to the season.",
      "He said: \"The players aren't ready. We have a new team and some of the players aren't at all fit enough to play. The team didn't function at all during the final stage of the game. That's just the way it is.",
      "\"They need to bring more intensity and get fitter in order to meet my standards. After the international break, we face real competition and must perform as a team.",
      "\"That begins with taking responsibility and delivering individual performances. And they have to demonstrate to me that they want to work together.",
      "\"First, we need to have the players. There's been a major upheaval. A lot has changed in the leadership and hierarchy of the team. Now new players have to step up. We didn't do that well today.\"",
      "Leverkusen skipper Robert Andrich also delivered some scathing remarks in his post-match chat, moaning about a shortage of team spirit and unity.",
      "\"This has nothing to do with unrest or player changes,\" he said, seemingly contradicting Ten Hag. \"But rather with the team on the pitch. We have too many people preoccupied with other things.",
      "\"We have too many people who are concerned only with themselves. Everyone played for themselves. Everyone ran around the pitch on their own.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim could be on the brink of leaving himself powerless to avoid breaking a golden rule at Manchester United that has lasted almost 90 years.",
      "Woven into the fabric of the Red Devils’ history and club culture is the production line of academy talents into the first team. Following a countless list of names beforehand, the Class of '92 remains the most famous group of players to have made this transition, going on to leave an indelible mark on English football.",
      "Even in the years following United’s golden era, England internationals such as Danny Welbeck, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford have proven that Carrington continues to produce top-tier young talent.",
      "That, in turn, has allowed United to uphold an impressive tradition envied by rival clubs by including an academy graduate in every first-team squad since October 1937. However, that record now seems under threat with Amorim fast running out of young stars ready for first-term football.",
      "With Rashford's transfer to Barcelona, Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea and the retirement of veteran Jonny Evans, Kobbie Mainoo is one of the only remaining players in the current squad who came through the academy, alongside Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson. Mainoo was the only one of these to feature in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley.",
      "But even the 20-year-old could now be on his way out, with the midfielder far down Amorim's pecking order. Mainoo was once considered a key part of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons.",
      "The youngster quickly racked up a remarkable collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago. He also claimed the man of the match award in United's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City in 2024, where he scored the decisive goal.",
      "But under Amorim, Mainoo has only started 16 matches over the past two seasons. After being benched for two consecutive Premier League games, Mainoo finally saw action in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout loss at Grimsby.",
      "Before coming on as a half-time substitute in the victory over Burnley, he hadn't played a single minute of Premier League football this season. This has understandably led to a sense of frustration on the youngster’s part.",
      "Recent reports suggested that Serie A champions Napoli are keen to offer the £50million-rated Mainoo a four-year contract. Having seen former United team-mate Scott McTominay make the same move a year ago and achieve great success, Mainoo reportedly informed United bosses of his desire to go out on loan while some reports claimed he'd be open to a permanent move ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "Despite talks over an extension to his current contract reaching a standstill, United decided to block his move to Serie A. Amorim has also been outspoken about his wish for Mainoo to stay and compete for his place in the squad, showing his reluctance to let go of the team's last senior academy graduate, but could face a fight to convince him to stay.",
      "The Portuguese said in his press conference ahead of the clash with Burnley: \"I want Kobbie to stay. He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "While some supporters have voiced concern on social media about United's long-standing tradition potentially ending, others remain unbothered, believing the squad's performance is the most important thing.",
      "Should Mainoo get his last-minute move to Napoli, United would still have veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton within their ranks to select for the matchday squad and preserve the tradition.",
      "But the 39-year-old, who turned out for the academy between 2002 and 2005, currently sits behind Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir in the pecking order, whilst United are pursuing a late deal for either Emi Martinez or Senne Lammens. That means the record is likely to be broken if Mainoo were to depart, unless a new academy starlet suddenly emerges.",

      "Ruben Amorim defended Manchester United's goalkeepers after a dramatic 3-2 win against Burnley.",

      "The Turkey international was unable to push a save wide and Anthony took advantage. Amorim has watched his goalkeepers make mistakes against Arsenal, Grimsby and Burnley this term, but defended his 'keepers after the win over the Clarets, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side.",
      "\"Guys, they are humans,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",
      "Amorim said he was pleased with United's response to the Grimsby debacle and praised Bryan Mbeumo's contribution: \"It was impressive, the way he (Mbeumo) stretched the team, the quality he has in the first touch.",
      "\"You can feel that we are a different team, because when we win the ball, we have one guy stretching the team. Last season we struggled a little bit with that.",
      "\"And then you can see the first minutes of the game. You can understand, you can compare this to Wednesday, and you can feel it. It's not about playing well.",
      "\"The sound of the fans when we are pressing and winning balls and corners, and you sprint to get a corner, you sprint to get a throw in, it's nothing to do with the tactical and technical aspects. So today, I just need to watch sometimes the first minutes to understand the mindset of the team.\"",

      "\"We return a little bit to think that we should be competitive, creating chances, we need to score. Sometimes we block the opponent in their half, we press really high. So we have a lot to do, but we return a little bit to our level today.\"",

      "Manchester United produced the perfect reaction to their shocking Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby in midweek. That is the view of former Liverpool midfielder and Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy, who believes United put in a performance to \"get the fans on side\" in their 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has come under pressure this week following the defeat to Grimsby but Murphy was full of praise for United's response at Old Trafford.",
      "\"There was a lot of criticism after the Grimsby performance, and rightly so, for the manager and the players and I think what all of the Manchester United supporters wanted to see today was a reaction,\" Murphy told Match of the Day.",
      "\"In the intensity, in the passion, in the desire and the quality and they certainly got that first half. They should have been out of sight.",
      "\"There were many good performances and it wasn't about tactics. It was simply about who wants to work hard, make tackles, close people down and then who has the courage to play courageous passes, try and open the team up and risk making mistakes. If you are going to do that, you will get the fans on side.\"",
      "An own goal from Josh Cullen and goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes secured United's first win of the season, despite Burnley twice coming from behind to equalise.",
      "And Murphy was quick to point out the difference he has seen between United last season and their performances so far this season.",
      "\"They have got more legs,\" Murphy added.",
      "\"If you look at the starting line-up, if you think of (Mason) Mount, he has always been good without the ball. Cunha and Mbeumo are quick and strong so you can be more athletic.",
      "\"I have got to give United credit. When you go 2-2 at home, and the crowd get a bit deflated, they went again and pushed on and they got the winner at the end.\"",

      "14-year-old goalscoring prodigy JJ Gabriel is making serious waves at Manchester United, with supporters urging for the 'star boy' to be promoted to the first team as soon as possible and to be 'protected at all costs'.",
      "The young Red Devil left fans in awe with his performance in Saturday's under-18s Premier League match, where United claimed a 4-0 victory over Derby County. The teenager netted a hat-trick within 22 minutes, scoring in the fifth, 14th and 27th minutes to fire his side into a 3-0 lead before the half-hour mark.",
      "Amir Ibragimov, 17, scored the other goal from a penalty in the 66th minute, but all eyes were on young Gabriel. Supporters took to social media to hail the young forward's weekend performance, with one predicting he will become United's new star boy following Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea.",
      "They said: \"Chelsea took our egotistic Garnacho away, but La Carrington is cooking another starboy, his name is JJ Gabriel, bagged a hat-trick today. He's just 14!\"",
      "Another fan said: \"How did I forget my star boy JJ Gabriel? Invest your stocks now!\" while a third added: \"JJ Gabriel has a hat-trick in 27 minutes for Manchester United Under 18's against Derby. He is 14 years old. Protect him at all costs.\"",
      "With growing demands for the Old Trafford hierarchy to \"protect\" the young player, it appears the top brass are way ahead and have already taken action. Gabriel secured his future with United this summer and is expected to remain at Old Trafford until he reaches 16, when he becomes eligible to sign a professional contract with the club.",
      "As revealed earlier this month, the teenager, nicknamed 'Kid Messi', is set to be called up to first-team training this season. Gabriel and his family were recently introduced to Ruben Amorim, while the highly-rated youngster was also invited to watch United's game against Arsenal in the directors' box after he committed his future to the club.",
      "Technical director Jason Wilcox is believed to have played a key role in persuading the teenager to remain at United after arranging a meeting with manager Amorim at the training facility to make him feel more included within the squad.",
      "Whilst it's not uncommon for academy prospects to train with the senior team - and occasionally progress early to become vital members of the starting eleven - the fact Gabriel is already creating a stir at merely 14 years old indicates his potential could be extraordinarily high.",
      "Gabriel will not feature in United's campaign for the FA Youth Cup this season, however, as participants must be born before the cut-off date of 31 August 2010.",
      "The young forward, who is the son of former Republic of Ireland international Joe O'Cearuill, has netted five goals in three outings for the under-18s side already this season. This includes the hat-trick against Derby and goals against Middlesbrough and Everton.",
      "During the previous campaign, the youngster scored three times in as many outings, impressing fans with his flair, technical ability, and finishing prowess despite his tender years.",
      "Certain United supporters have compared him to Barcelona's Lamine Yamal, with one enthusiastic fan writing at the weekend: \"JJ Gabriel is a different level of talent. Man Utd must try to keep him at all costs. I can see why Barcelona want him. He could be an LW version of Yamal in the future.\"",
      "Another supporter said: \"I really hope that we can hold onto JJ Gabriel - he looks amazing and is only 14. There is a lot of chatter that he may move on. As he's an Irish passport holder, he could join the likes of Barcelona now.\"",
      "Given Gabriel's Irish passport status, the 14-year-old would be permitted to transfer to a European side at 16 rather than waiting until 18. This had attracted interest from the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich before United convinced him to stay.",

      "Manchester United beat Burnley 3-2 in their final Premier League fixture before the September internationals.",
      "A Josh Cullen own goal gave United a deserved lead in the first half but their failure to take chances cost them as Lyle Foster equalised for Burnley 10 minutes into the second half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo immediately regained United's lead but yet another Altay Bayindir error gifted Burnley a second equaliser through Jaidon Anthony.",
      "But Bruno Fernandes stepped up to convert an added time penalty and give United their first win of the campaign.",
      "Here are how the players and manager rated:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Recalled and a spectator for the entirety of the first half. However, he spilt a shot from a corner to allow Jaidon Anthony to make it 2-2. 4",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "As slick on the ball as the turf in the rainy conditions, doubtless helped by his midweek rest. Nowhere near Lyle Foster for the equaliser. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Closed down Hannibal Mejbri quickly enough to ensure he did not have a clear shot at goal. Like his fellow centre halves, left Foster unmarked. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "The other defender not scarred from the Grimsby Town debacle, Shaw was urgent and drifted wide to double as a left back at times. 6",
      "Amad",
      "A huge improvement on his tentative midweek performance. Drove at Burnley constantly and came close to scoring from a corner. Faded after the pause but won the penalty. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "His header off the crossbar rebounded in off Cullen to give United the lead. A clear upgrade on Manuel Ugarte. Came off for Benjamin Sesko. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Regularly involved and teed up Amad for a volley at goal from a first-half corner. Booked for a needless sliding tackle as frustration got the better of him. Scored the added-time penalty. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Switched to the left wing at the expense of the dropped Patrick Dorgu and his movement infield gave United another outlet. Did well for Bryan Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "The best player on the pitch in the first half and so athletic he outpaced Kyle Walker. For the third August running, he got injured. Off at half-time. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "His first touch is one of the most delicate since Dimitar Berbatov's and Mbeumo went close to a first Old Trafford goal until he put United 2-1 up. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Forced off in the first half with a hamstring injury, having begun quite brightly as the de facto centre forward in United's strikerless system. 6",
      "Subs",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Had a good chance before half-time and played a key role in Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Has some brass neck to want out when he can't get in the worst United team in 51 years. Lackadaisical. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Went close with a header. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Returned from injury. 6",
      "Manager",
      "Made the right calls in the right positions and United were fluid again without a striker starting. Injuries disrupted United. 6",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",

      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame.

      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",

It took him 4 years to win a trophy.",

Nick Woltemade sounds less like a centre-forward and more like a password you’d get if you smashed your forehead against the keyboard while trying to log into Football Manager after three pints. Yes, he’s tall. Yes, he’s German. But we’ve all seen this movie before—and no, I’m not talking about the 2014 World Cup Final. I’m talking about **“The Obertan Illusion: Part Deux.”**",

      "Now, I’m not saying Woltemade will definitely follow in Manucho’s footsteps and disappear into a Bundesliga B team before we can finish pronouncing his name. But in the harsh light of Premier League reality, signing him to solve their goal-scoring crisis feels less like a bold footballing move and more like a deleted scene from 8½, where the director is spiralling into madness trying to find meaning in a striker with two career goals and the gait of a confused giraffe.",

This is the reason elite players ultimately don’t want to stay. They have elite mentality and they’re at a club which doesn’t. So they either become players who only care if it’s a big game or they move on.",

      "The Saturday 3pm slot has been decimated and desecrated more than ever this Premier League season, but it refuses to go quietly.",
      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",
      "Andoni Iraola might just be a genius, while Ruben Amorim looks more lucky general after a late VAR intervention spared United more blushes after a truly mortifying week.",
      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "Plenty of you believe Ruben Amorim should either resign or be sacked, with three replacements touted in the Mailbox, but he’s also not the problem in the minds of many, and as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s also a bit of Newcastle anger at Liverpool and some Champions League frustration, but this is indeed another Amorim, Manchester United edition.",

      "There’s something fundamentally wrong about the United spirit. It’s bigger than squad revamp, or structural development. It’s the psyche.\nIn the Fergie era, playing against a team with John O’Shea and Fredrico Macheda, you still held your breath, knowing that United were capable of springing up surprises.",
      "Since Fergie’s departure, there’s a kind of trepidation coaches face with managing the team. Every coach since then, has tried to pick out scapegoats responsible for dampening the team spirit and there’s been much talk on players who are hungry enough to win for the team. In spite of it, the sloppiness lingers. The team spirit remains lackadaisical. Players do the bare minimum with the only consistent player across several seasons being Fernades.",
      "The reason I adore Mourinho’s time with United is based on the simple fact he worked the boys to a Europa trophy. You could see the way some of the players limped towards their medals. He pushed them hard. It reminded of what it meant to play for Ferguson. You either worked your butt off or moved. Other coaches treat them as snowflakes.",
      "Amorim’s recent interview has shown he is not fit for the job. His morale is low. His drive, beaten up. He has not shown any sense of urgency by tweaking his formation. He is like the proverbial mad man doing the same thing over and again while expecting the same results.",
      "This is business, not a charity organization. If he can’t inspire this team, after ostracizing other players in his revamp, he should resign.\nVictor, Nigeria. Glory Glory Man Utd.",
      "",
      "What (the f..k) is wrong with MUFC? Your inbox is overflowing with vitriol, hand wringing and hundreds of different interpretations but I have YET to see one viable solution. We’ve changed owners, infrastructure, coaches, players, playing style and goodness knows what else yet nothing seems to have worked.",
      "Maybe, as someone (somewhat harshly) said, we’ve just reverted back to the mean, i.e. pre Fergie days, the days of Duxbury and Blackmore, or the 70’s team that got relegated, before we developed (or more accurately, marketed!) this rubbish about DNA. The media follows and scrutinizes every nuance (“his facial expressions look like he’s given up”) and former players constantly pound on about how things used to be. They remind me of the MAGA folk with their constant mantra of “Make United Great Again”. Let’s me honest, during the Fergie years, we were blessed, spoilt and damn lucky. A whole bunch of things came together at the same time. The stars were aligned. But WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT TO EVER BE THAT GOOD AGAIN. And this is the simple fact that everyone seems to be ignoring.",
      "The current owners suck every penny possible from the club while the players drive up in luxury cars.  I’m sure it’s a toxic place to work at the moment. We’ve had countless managers in the last few years. Does anyone seriously think a new manager is the solution? And as Amorin said, you can’t change all 22 players. “Open Heart Surgery”? This patient has flat lined.",
      "The only solution, as far as I can see, is to stick with Amorin and go down. This will shed the prima donnas and allow us to re-build with young, hungry youth who still think it is a privilege to play for the shirt (which ironically is what Amorin did at Sporting). Last season we were (un)lucky not to go down and just a few months later, Gary Neville thinks we will make the Top Four! Maybe a season or two out of the spotlight is about the only thing that hasn’t been tried. Then we will really see who wants to play for MUFC making JUST 50k a week!\nAdidasmufc (If it forced the Glazers to sell, it might even be worth it)",
      "",
      "So the Man Utd manager merry go round looks like it’s cranking up again right on time. I’d expect the players to come out and give another terrible performance against Burnley just to twist the knife and ensure there is no option but to sack Amorim. 2-0 or 3-1 to Burney I would guess with a goalkeeper howler the icing on the cake – probably an Olympico.",
      "Whether you want him to stay longer or not, like him or not, it is pretty ridiculous to blame the manager. Yet another high profile manager who has failed.",
      "So it must be the players then? According to Transfermkt we have the 5th most expensive squad in the league. And we were 5th last year too yet finished 15th. So it surely cannot be the quality of the players.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the players attitude is terrible and has been for a long time regardless of who is in charge. They do manage to pick themselves up for the big games and occasionally get a commendable draw to fool us into thinking there’s some hope. Attitude is not the players fault. Your attitude is driven by your compensation and working conditions. Clearly Utd players are extremely well compensated so even clearer is that their working conditions must be absolutely atrocious. Yes, it must be terrible to pick up 200 k per week to kick a ball about I hear you say. Grimsby players are happily kicking a ball about with smiles on their faces for significantly less money. So are most of the other teams in the premier league.",
      "So yeah, let’s just get a shiny new manager again, spend a few hundred million on his type of players and listen to the club bulshit us that they have a long term plan and that it will take a few transfer windows to fix. Don’t worry, we’ll win the league in three years time lads, we have a plan… does the 3 years start again with the new manager? Asking for a friend…",
      "The way the club is run, we deserve to be relegated but that still wouldn’t make those in charge stop and think that maybe it’s never been the pl;ayers or the manager, they’re just the easy targets of a club where so many senior club positions have seen well renowned people come and go with such regularity that clearly there is political fuck-tard-ery hapenning that is ruining the club from the inside. We have no right to think we should be title contenders every year but the amount of money the club has compared to the rest does mean that the current state of the club can only be caused by severe incompetenece at board level.\nJon, Cape Town (Get relegated, Glazers out, maybe we might win a few games in the Championship, especially if all our current players defect and we have to bring through our youth.

      "When Rúben Amorim walked into Manchester United, I’ll admit it: I let optimism in through the front door. Not blind optimism, not naïve giddiness, but a conscious decision on how to live life and how to relate to football. Supporting United, after all, isn’t just about results. It’s about how you choose to hold yourself through the cycles of joy and pain.",

      "Arsenal: Pleasure in the Pain",
      "A loss is a loss, and a title race probably died before it was ever born – but the performance brought more pleasure than pain. United played well. Fine margins swung the contest: VAR blessing Arsenal with a questionable goal, a penalty shout ignored, Dorgu’s shot pinging off the post, Raya standing tall in goal. There was enough there to feel alive again, to sense possibility.",
      "Fulham: A Half to Remember Against Fulham,",
      "Disappointment on paper but a bright first half. Cunha already looks like he could be sensational. Amorim nailed it in his analysis: United became too focused on holding onto the result rather than playing. That’s coaching clarity – an honesty I value more than lip service.",
      "Grimsby: oh God Grimsby! Goalkeepers and Perspective",
      "Then came Grimsby. What do you even say? The truth is simple: United need a goalkeeper. Hard to find, harder to bed in, but the difference it makes is night and day.And yet as bad as it was and jeez loueeeze Onana why! — United clawed back to 2-2, showed fight, and were a penalty away from advancing. Embarrassing? Of course. Defining? Not really. Ole reached semis and finals without winning them. Ten Hag delivered two trophies, but that wasn’t enough to make me shed a tear when he left. In fact i cheered. He was an odd man!  Football moves on.",
      "On Amorim",
      "Here’s the crux: I love Amorim. It could be another false dawn. He could be sacked tomorrow if results don’t turn. His post-Grimsby interview carried a chill that United fans know too well. But that doesn’t shake me.  Because how you support your club is personal. For me, it’s not about playing small or coy. I grew up in the glory days. I will die on the hill that football is cyclical, and United will be back. Juventus were relegated, came back, and won multiple titles. Why should Manchester United be any different?So yes, results are awful. Amorim’s future is uncertain. But Manchester United aren’t a pity project. We’re a behemoth, and behemoths rise. Sunnier days will come.",

Russell Martin’s first 9 weeks at the club have been so calamitous, bewildering and humiliating that he has surely now completely destroyed his reputation as a coach. Once he’s finally jettisoned from the Ibrox hot seat he’ll hopefully never darken the door of a dugout ever again.",
      "Without going into detail about our inevitably pathetic start to this season under Martin (because I know that know one is bothered about Scottish football other than Johnny Nic), I wanted to touch on the strangely similar fates of Rangers and Man Utd, two former perennial league challengers who suffered equally if slightly different humiliations on Wednesday night.",
      "Both clubs emerged as the dominant force in their countries in the 90s, both big spenders who could pick and choose who they wanted and hoovered up trophy after trophy, becoming the panto villains of their leagues. Then in the 2000s, both were suddenly pegged back by domestic challenges – in Scotland from a Larsson-inspired O’Neill side and from Wenger/Mourinho respectively in England. The trophies weren’t as easy to come by in this decade though both clubs did manage 3 titles in a row amongst some other great moments.",
      "Then the wheels come off. For Rangers this is 2012, admin, relegation to the Scottish third division and a painful and mind-numbing climb back up to the top flight. For United, 2013 and the retirement of Fergie. Obviously their 2010s weren’t as totally abject but it’s clearly when the rot set in.",
      "Since then both clubs have had little glimmers of hope – the odd trophy, a league title for Rangers, both have reached EL finals – but currently both find themselves with unwanted and disliked ‘system’ managers with neither the players to play these systems, nor the ability to coach them.",
      "Maybe they’re still the clubs which best represent the UK in 2025. Both fallen giants, one with a huge global reach but with supporters who must be wondering why they should still bother to respect their adopted club, the other undone by financial mismanagement and dodgy tax practices. Both currently owned by Americans.",
      "So what lies in store for these two 90s giants? Do we sit tight and await the arrival of some sort of new generational manager to rescue us? Hope that our rivals fail so badly as to allow us to catch up? What does it mean when the classic glory-hunter clubs stop achieving glory?",
      "In the meantime, fans of each club will continue to wade through further false-dawns and embarrassment while re-watching YouTube compilations from 20-30 years ago for the hundredth time.\nDuncan (imagine currently being a 90s kid who supports both!), York",

      "As my mail a week back, when United were still riding the high of the Arsenal draw, already said: Amorim is a goner.",
      "1. Tactical inflexibility. His formation doesn’t suit the squad and actually makes good players worse by forcing them into bad roles. He insists on two in midfield — but in the Premier League, you need two cyborgs to cover that ground. Cyborgs don’t exist yet.",
      "2. The Bruno dilemma. Amorim didn’t have the guts to move on from Bruno at the pivotal moment when the money could have been reinvested. Instead, the team remains unbalanced around him.",
      "3. Favoritism over competition. He preaches competition but picks his favourites regardless of form. That’s how you lose the dressing room — just ask Ten Hag or Solskjaer.",
      "4. The “donut guy” effect. Amorim is the classic office donut guy: bad at his job but really nice, so people look the other way. He gives media and YouTubers open access, which shields him from proper criticism.",
      "All in all, he’s finished. The real worry is what comes next. The United hierarchy will panic and swing back towards a “local” man-manager type — Gareth Southgate territory — and we’ll end up with another Maguire contract to show for it.",
      "Mark my words.",
      "Kind regards,\nMike",
      "",
      "For such a big fellow, Andre Onana sure has weak hands, and everybody knows it now. Will he leave at a deep discount after a loan ot three, or grimly run his contract down? And is Amorim as done as he looks, or is ownership paralyzed by the investments they’ve made in him — i.e., the good players he’s discarded and/or demoralized, some of whom have already been sold at significant losses, and the dubious players he’s brought in for his 343 master plan that’s, honestly, *this close to clicking. I’m rather hoping it’s the latter, because I’d be quite keen to see Kobbie Mainoo in black and white. I do think that Manchester United supporters should keep faith in Mbeumo and Sesko, though. Sesko got into the right spots far better than Hojlund ever did.",
      "And speaking of poor form: to whomever it was that accused NUFC of dirty play against Liverpool earlier this week, your post nearly made me write furious things. But I let it rest for a while and can now simply suggest you rewatch that match whilst sober, then consider the injury list it left. Ekitike yanked Tonali’s arm out of its socket, for goodness’ sake. While I watched, I was almost always angry at what your lot got away with; I’ll spare you the list, of which I hope you have been made aware by now. That said, it wasn’t all one-way. We got away with a few bad fouls, too, and nobody is complaining about Gordon’s red card (except at Gordon himself). We can all do with being less one-eyed.

      "And irritatingly, we had that same kind of state when we appointed Ole to replace the toxicity of Jose. Straightforward talk, good mood, players responded and we came close to success. Yes, both managers lack tactical knowledge but we can see what supposed tactical experts deliver.",
      "That said, sometimes sacking the manager is still the right thing. Moyes was out of his depth, had entirely the wrong attitude. And while his backing such as it was made headlines for all the wrong reasons, he also could fall back on a squad that had just won the league. Aging, sure, but obviously capable. We can definitely agree that it set the tone for the utter dismantling of everything that had been built.",
      "Ole was also shafted by the board deciding unilaterally to sign Ronaldo even though he wasn’t needed or wanted by the manager. He completely destabilised the team that was seeming to be coming together. He might have even got something out of Sancho, because there’s a lad that needs an arm round the shoulder not being shouted at. He did choose to sign Maguire though, so he’ll always have that mark against him. But sacking Ole was wrong, for me. The facts of his tenure prove it.",
      "We weren’t wrong to sack Jose, who had made the club a very unpleasant place. I think we were wrong to sack Van Gaal. Yes, the football made your eyes bleed but he was in the middle of changing the team, and had form for delivering good football. He still brought success.",
      "Similarly, we were wrong to sack Ten Hag, who was also in the middle of the rebuild, and delivered success on the pitch. We replaced “he has no style” with *this*, after all, and mostly because he never got the media onside. But we should have also listen to Rangnick (also more points per game than Amorim).",
      "It is clear to anyone with eyes that Amorim is not providing any answers and is making more problems than solutions. He needs to go. Whoever comes next needs to be someone who picks the team up again. We aren’t in a position of expecting success – although inevitably there are many “fans” who think otherwise – but we absolutely have a squad that should be at the upper end of the league. That’s not entitlement, that’s just plain obvious. We were, after all, 4 points from 3rd and FA Cup holders when this maniac was appointed against the judgement of Dan Ashworth. The arrogance and ignorance of billionaires in full effect.",
      "The answer is someone stable, who brings some happiness back to the squad. I don’t want it to be Southgate – he was a little weasel of a player – but managers like him are two a penny. And maybe someone like Ruud or Carrick would have a higher ceiling? Give them until the end of the season and then extend for another year, year on year.",
      "Either way, my red line on Mainoo stands. And I will watch on, somewhat detached, until the ghost of Amorim is finally expunged from the club. Hopefully by Monday morning.\nBadwolf",

      "Buying a new everything will not fix your problems. You’ve been doing it for 12 years and getting worse. A world class manager at their peak needs to be appointed (you’ve not appointed one at their peak in the last 12 years apart from perhaps mourinho on the top of the downslope and he got you second with a bunch of players with terrible attitudes as he stated at the time). And you need to let that manager buy the players they believe are good enough and bring youth through.

      "Sancho has entered the final year of his contract, with United holding the option to extend by a further year.",
      "The 25-year-old was signed for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2021.",

      "\"It could be the perfect move for both the player and a team currently lacking a spark in the final third.",
      "\"Three goals and four assists in 31 appearances while on loan at Chelsea last season was a modest return but it is difficult to carve a way into Enzo Maresca's bloated squad.",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",

      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "\"Even when Amad is missing that goal - I love Amad, if he's giving everything.",
      "\"We need to understand that we always need to be at this level of effort. Because even in the game, we played well in the beginning. I think we struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match is not so perfect and you can feel the players struggle a little bit, even in the second half but the effort was always there.",
      "\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Amorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.",
      "Cunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.",
      "Asked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"",
      "United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.",
      "Andre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.",
      "Amorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"",
      "\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.",
      "\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.",
      "\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.",
      "\"But the effort was there.",
      "\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.",
      "\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.",
      "\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.",
      "\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"",
      "Amorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.",
      "Sesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.",
      "\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.",
      "\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.",
      "\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.",
      "\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",

      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",
