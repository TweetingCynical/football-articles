      "The transfer window hasn’t even opened yet and we already know that Antoine Semenyo’s future promises to be THE big story in January.",
      "The Bournemouth star opted to stay on the south coast after interest in the summer, signing a new contract to start the season. But that always appeared a temporary solution, particularly after details of a £65million release clause in his deal became public.",
      "With nine goals in 17 Bournemouth appearances, the Ghanaian is hot property and almost certain to be on the move at the start of 2026.",
      "The forward is said to want a deal completed at the start of the month. With Manchester City leading the race and also wanting a move wrapped up quickly. But there is also interest from the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "First things first, Semenyo and Bournemouth need to strike while the iron is relatively hot. Sure, Semenyo has scored in his last three Premier League games but none of those goals was in a winning cause and this run had been preceded by seven blanks.",
      "Semenyo has also gone ten Premier League matches without an assist. The £65million release clause will be met in this January transfer window but if the Ghanaian stays at Bournemouth, there is no guarantee that figure would be seen as value in the summer.",
      "So, a January move makes sense all round. It is nice for the 26-year-old - whose career numbers are good but not startling - to have so many blue-chip suitors and there is an obvious attraction in a move to Manchester City.",
      "But Semenyo’s best bet could well be Manchester United, if their interest is deadly serious. At City, Semenyo will have to take his chances with the vagaries of the Pep Guardiola selection process. That does not always work out well - ask Jack Grealish.",
      "And unless Mohamed Salah does leave, Semenyo will also face a tough fight for a starting place at Liverpool. There is also competition at Old Trafford, for sure, but it now feels like an exciting project and one that Semenyo could be front and centre of, rather than just another option.",
      "Semenyo has a big decision to make. But one thing we do know is that he has to leave Bournemouth. Semenyo deserves to be showcasing his skills on the biggest stages. Which rules out a move to Manchester United - a club which has ruined talents like him in recent years.",
      "Moving to Liverpool to be Mo Salah's heir apparent would be a thankless task, given what the Egyptian king has achieved. While Liverpool are going through a period of huge uncertainty when it comes to Arne Slot.",
      "Which leaves Manchester City as Semenyo's best destination. He would have to work hard to earn regular starts under Guardiola and there would be no guarantees.",
      "But he would be learning from the best manager in the business when it comes to developing his skills. Not to mention winning trophies.",
      "Semenyo's decision to stay at Bournemouth in the summer looks a masterstroke, especially when you consider some of the struggles of his former team-mates. Milos Kerkez at Liverpool a case in point.",
      "His release clause makes him very attainable, but if he could strike a deal to remain with the Cherries and move for the same fee in the summer I would stay where I was. Mid-season moves are always a risk. You have no pre-season to get up to speed with their patterns for one.",
      "And waiting a few months allows Semenyo to see how the land lies at the various clubs. If Salah really is destined to move on, then maybe a move to Liverpool becomes more attractive. Manchester City are an obvious option, but he'd have to accept not playing every minute. So if I were him, I'd stick rather than twist right now.",
      "Semenyo should go to Manchester City and be an absolute superstar. There is nothing like being wanted, pursued and championed - especially when Guardiola is the manager who wants you.",
      "What an opportunity for one of the Premier League’s best wingers. He can operate with both feet, on both wings, is a big personality, leader and scorer of big goals.",
      "This guy has got the lot. He has been phenomenal for Bournemouth and I was amazed that clubs did not push harder for him last summer. But the reason he should choose City over Liverpool, Manchester United and the rest is that feeling of being wanted. That sense that he will be given an incredible platform to shine by the best manager in the Premier League with a team on the rise again.",
      "Yes, there will be competition for places. But City have moved for him despite having the depth of players like Jeremy Doku and Savinho. But he is a step up in my view on Savinho. It is interesting that Semenyo renegotiated his contract and Bournemouth knew inserting a clause would make them vulnerable.",
      "The uncertainty has undoubtedly impacted on Bournemouth - but that underlines the player’s quality.",
      "Bournemouth and Semenyo have been preparing for a January exit since the Cherries star signed his new contract, so the time is now for a move. But transfers during the season are not always well-suited to smart decisions.",
      "Semenyo has no shortage of suitors and plenty of uncertainty. Where Liverpool and Manchester United will finish the season is anyone’s guess, and for Semenyo to leave the south coast, trophies and European football will be preferred on the agenda.",
      "So, I can understand why Manchester City appears to be the player’s favoured choice. Playing time won’t be immediately guaranteed but a Premier League winners' medal could be won.",
      "Semenyo's versatility will offer multiple chances to come into Guardiola's thinking. And a move presents an opportunity to work with one of the most iconic coaches of his era.",
      "Some may point to Guardiola's future as a reason to look elsewhere, but it's hardly like Ruben Amorim and Arne Slot have always looked secure options in recent months.",
      "Do Manchester City really need Antoine Semenyo? Or are they buying the Ghana forward to stop their title rivals recruiting the best Premier League player in a club not playing in Europe this season?",
      "Guardiola has spent big in the last two windows and summer signing Rayan Cherkhi is now playing superbly as City have won eight in a row. The system and the players are working well.",
      "Liverpool might need a replacement for Mo Salah this January - though they would be better buying Marc Guehi six months before the end of his contract. Arsenal bought Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke in the summer to play out wide and cannot keep spending.",
      "City is a great move for Semenyo but there are historic warnings from clubs who bought big late in the season. Malcolm Allison paid a club record £200,000 for Rodney Marsh when City were four points clear at the top in March 1972 before finishing fourth.",
      "Aston Villa made a mistake buying Tony Cascarino in March 1990. And in February 1996, Newcastle bought Faustino Asprilla for £6.7m when Kevin Keegan’s side were nine points clear at the top of the table before finishing four points behind Manchester United.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim could keep faith with his back four even when his stars return from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations. The United boss has insisted he will not immediately swap to a back three after switching shape for the first time as head coach in the Boxing Day win against Newcastle.",
      "Amorim showed flexibility in his methods for the first time in his 14 months in charge at Old Trafford. The Portuguese coach has claimed that United's new formation could stick around in the coming weeks.",
      "The Red Devils adjusted their shape with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo all absent through international duty, and Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes all on the injury list. But Amorim has suggested he had always planned to evolve during his time in the Red Devils' hotseat.",
      "The 40-year-old only avoided doing so earlier so that it would not give the impression he had caved to media pressure. Amorim has played the 3-4-2-1 shape, which he had success with at Sporting CP, almost exclusively at United, and felt it was important to use embed in his principles using that system.",
      "\"First of all, it's a process,\" said Amorim. \"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process. We are trying to build an identity.",
      "\"Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing. It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\"",
      "Amorim has been adamant that his principles of play will remain the same regardless of the shape of his side. But, having finally moved away from utilising wing-backs, a back four might be seen more often as his tenure enters its next phase.",
      "Such flexibility should offer opponents more headaches with Newcastle already being forced into off-the-cuff changes at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said.",
      "\"But that was something that I was talking about. But when you talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I'm changing because of you [the media], and, I think, that is the end for the manager.",

      "A minor injury issue has meant the playmaker, who has missed less than 10 games across five years in Manchester, is on the sidelines, but already itching to get back involved. United need to tread carefully regarding Fernandes' fitness if they want to avoid a prolonged issue.",
      "But Fernandes' competitive streak has already seen him asking his head coach if he can involve himself in training, but Amorim accepts there is no chance of him playing in the short-term.",
      "He said: \"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know. No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance. Kobbie Mainoo is going to start on the [training] pitch also, so we will see. Matthijs is struggling a little bit. Harry the same thing.\"",
      "Fernandes was at Old Trafford on Boxing Day to watch United beat Newcastle. The 1-0 win ended a run of six Premier League games without a win when the 31-year-old doesn't play - underlining his importance and influence.",
      "Lisandro Martinez was named captain with Fernandes missing, but Amorim detailed how his influence extends beyond the pitch and praised the way he had continued to interact his team-mates while injured.",
      "\"He's always speaking, that's why he's the captain,\" the United head coach added. \"He has bad things sometimes, the way move his arms, but he has a lot of good things. The practice, every time he makes a recovery, he is the guy who is going to watch the other guys' training that day. So there is a lot of things that you guys don't see but that he does. He's a great leader all the time.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there. I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader. The guy is a leader.\"",
      "When United face Wolves they won't just be without Fernandes. Mason Mount is facing a late fitness test, while centre backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out. Kobbie Mainoo won't be fit whilst Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has seen his side lose just one of their last seven, which has seen them rise up to sixth - leaving them three points outside the top four. Their next three games see them face Wolves, Leeds and Burnley - all of whom are among the bottom five teams in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been cautioned against constantly altering Manchester United's defensive line-up during matches due to the risk of upsetting his squad. United secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Newcastle at Old Trafford on Box‎ing Day, recording just their second Premier League clean sheet of the campaign.",
      "However, the Portuguese head coach came under fire after making multiple defensive switches in the second half as his side barely withstood a fierce late assault from their opponents. The substitutions included Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw being withdrawn for the relatively untested Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia late on, a decision which sparked surprise.",
      "Ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster has now urged Amorim to avoid making such alterations going forward, suggesting his players won't have been pleased with the disruption.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, the former England and Wrexham stopper said: \"Man United seem to make defensive changes a lot, wei‎rd ones as well. Maybe that's just his way and he obviously sees something that no one else does.",
      "\"Fair play to him, he's obviously getting the results at the moment. But I was thinking, why? If you ask professional footballers about what they think of that, they will tell you honestly and say you shouldn't do that.",
      "\"You don't understand what it's like being a team in those last dying moments, with seven or eight minutes to go. You don't mess with it. Everybody knows where they are.",
      "\"They've played the game there and they're comfy there. They know what's working. You don't need to just swap them for a defensive-minded player.\"",
      "Foster wasn't the only ex-United star to question the peculiar substitutions. Red Devils icon Gary Neville also admitted he was bewildered by the team that ended the match.",
      "Speaking on Sky Sp‎orts, Neville said: \"I'd go as far as to say it's the most bizarre Manchester United XI I've ever seen on the pitch at the end of a game. But they're hanging in there. They're fighting for their lives and Newcastle are pushing them.",
      "\"I thought Manchester United edged the first half. I thought they did really well, but then the substitutions came. The shape, the players on the pitch got even more bizarre, but they hung on.\"",
      "Amorim has remained committed to deploying a 3-4-2-1 system since taking charge at United, but shifted to a back four against Newcastle. Despite facing flak for his late-game changes, which saw the defence morph into a back six, Amorim insisted he was satisfied with the determination displayed by his squad.",
      "He said: \"I think we suffered all together. You can say that we defended well because we didn't suffer the goal, but they had chances to score a goal. We needed a little bit of luck sometimes. We managed to defend, sometimes with a back six, but we suffered together and that is a good feeling.",
      "\"If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. I think it's something that we need, to feel that we can win sometimes without playing so well. We can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\"",

      "The Scottish midfielder has flourished since his move to Naples, already securing both domestic cup and league honours. He was even crowned Serie A's Most Valuable Player last season.",
      "Hojlund joined McTominay at the club on a temporary deal this summer and appears to have settled in remarkably swiftly. The striker has netted nine goals across all competitions for his new team and on Sunday he needed just 13 minutes to break the deadlock. He doubled the advantage shortly before the interval, courtesy of a clever McTominay flick.",
      "Hojlund was described as \"unstoppable\" by La Gazzetta dello Sport, who particularly lauded the 22-year-old striker's finishing ability and his movement in the penalty area.",
      "\"Simply unmarkable,\" they wrote. \"He moved with the grace of a panther and the clinical nature of a veteran. His first goal was a masterclass in timing but the second showed he is a true predator in the box.\"",
      "McTominay delivered a stellar performance, playing a crucial role in the second goal. The Scottish midfielder was praised for his omnipresence on the field: \"McTominay was everywhere.",
      "\"His physical dominance in the middle allowed [Stanislav] Lobotka to create, while his late runs into the box are becoming Napoli's most dangerous tactical weapon.\"",
      "The Danish player is just one goal away from matching his total tally from last season at United. Corriere dello Sport highlighted his importance to Antonio Conte's Napoli side.",
      "Hojlund received a commendable 7.5/10 player rating for the match. They added: \"A true predator. He has transformed Conte's attack into a relentless machine. Two goals that felt inevitable from the moment the whistle blew.\"",
      "McTominay also received an impressive 6.5/10. They wrote: \"Overwhelming physicality. He dismantled Cremonese's attempts to build from the back. Even when not on the scoresheet his presence dictates the rhythm of the game.\"",
      "Despite a somewhat shaky start to their Serie A campaign, Tuttosport suggested that Hojlund could be the key to another league title for the reigning champions.",
      "They penned: \"Super Hojlund floored Cremonese. He is the missing piece of the puzzle that has brought Napoli back to the top. A devastating performance that confirms him as one of the best signings of the season.\"",
      "Once again, McTominay was singled out for praise, earning a 7/10 rating to Hojlund's 8/10. They added regarding the midfielder: \"The Scottish warrior.",
      "\"McTominay won every duel and provided the verticality that Napoli lacked in previous seasons. He is the heart of this team's transition play.\"",
      "All publications concurred that Hojlund was the game-changer with his scoring prowess, but La Repubblica highlighted just how pivotal McTominay was in securing the win.",
      "They reported: \"The Danish striker still managed to complete his brace, emerging from behind McTominay in a melee and slotting the ball into the net.",
      "\"This came just in time for Conte's team to enter the half-time break in the best possible shape, two goals up thanks to the excellent performances of the usual Lobotka, McTominay and the defensive unit.",
      "\"The finale was uneventful, with the Italian champions in complete control. From the Super Cup to the league this is their third straight victory, all 2-0.\"",

      "In addition to the strip from that notorious moment, a more difficult goodbye may come as he parts ways with the kit which he wore when lifting the 2011/12 Champions League trophy. Terry was in his full Blues kit despite being suspended for the penalty shootout win itself.",
      "While Chelsea fans may be queuing up for a Champions League-winning top, perhaps there will be some United fans in search of the grass stains left in Terry's 2008 shirt after his slip. After being called upon to take the decisive penalty following Cristiano Ronaldo's miss, Terry slipped as he hit the ball and struck the post in Moscow. The Red Devils went on to win in sudden death.",

They are among more than 20 items that the 45-year-old is putting up for auction with proceeds going to charity.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been a hit during his Barcelona loan spell - and the majority of the Catalan club's fans want the club to sign the Manchester United man permanently next summer according to a vote held by a Spanish outlet.",
      "Rashford joined the La Liga giants in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing to a deal that includes an option for Barca to sign him permanently at the end of the season. The Spanish giants will have to pay around £26million to keep Rashford in Catalonia beyond May 2026.",
      "The 28-year-old has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under Hansi Flick. Such form has placed him in contention for an England call-up for the World Cup next summer Flick, according to reports in Spain, wants to retain Rashford's services, and the club are actively working towards a deal.",
      "Mundo Deportivo hosted a poll which revealed 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would be in favour of keeping Rashford at the club, by activating the purchase option in his loan. A total of 6.3 per cent reckon that sporting chief Deco should hold off until the end of their season.",
      "That leaves almost 40 per cent of fans in opposition to signing Rashford permanently.",
      "For his part, Rashford appears content at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy product has discussed his future ambitions with the club. He told SPORT in an interview: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",
      "\"For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies. Last season was fantastic, but in life, everything happens very quickly, things change, and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this.",

      "With time off this Christmas, during La Liga's winter break, Rashford delivered presents to children at two Barcelona Foundation centres. The forward explained: “I grew up in this type of environment.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has, for the first time, been considering leaving Manchester United on a permanent basis, a new report claims. Mainoo, 20, has been left disgruntled by his lack of game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The midfielder's only start this season came in United's humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town in August. Mainoo pushed to leave his boyhood club on loan towards the end of the summer transfer window, but the Red Devils weren't willing to let him go.",
      "Amorim was set to turn to Mainoo for United's game at Aston Villa last Sunday before he suffered an injury in training. The calf problem also ruled him out of Friday's hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Newcastle.",
      "With just a few days until the January window opens, it's emerged that Mainoo is once again weighing up a departure - but this time not on loan. The i Paper report that sources close to the 10-time England international say that he's been exploring a permanent exit, with a number of clubs across Europe registering their interest.",
      "Napoli could be one of them. Former Old Trafford team-mates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have reignited their careers in Naples, and Mainoo has been tipped to be next.",
      "United, however, would only entertain a huge offer and are lacking depth in midfield. Bruno Fernandes is currently out injured and Casemiro has only played 90 minutes three times for United this season.",
      "Unless the Red Devils were able to sign one of their top midfield targets - Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or Adam Wharton - selling Mainoo would leave Amorim with only Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte as backups to Fernandes and Casemiro. Ugarte has started United's last two games while Mount picked up an injury on Boxing Day.",

      "Amorim went on to say: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",

      "This season, United have bounced back and are vying for a European spot, sitting just three points shy of the top four following their 1-0 victory over Newcastle United on Boxing Day. This is a significant step up from last season's performance, where they ended up 15th in the Premier League and suffered a loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "The life of a football manager can be a lonely one, especially when the threat of the sack looms large. So Wayne Rooney might have been forgiven for feeling somewhat abandoned when his wife, Coleen, was nowhere to be seen as he faced the axe at Plymouth this time last year.",
      "It was almost exactly one year ago this Sunday that Rooney coached the Pilgrims for the last time. The Devon outfit travelled to Oxford on December 29, 2024, in desperate need of points to improve their Championship relegation odds against a rival in similar circumstances.",
      "Many managers might expect to turn around and see a few familiar faces in the crowd for moral support on such occasions. And yet Coleen was nowhere to be seen during Rooney's make-or-break moment.",
      "Instead, she was taking in some festive football at Goodison Park, where she watched her local team take on Nottingham Forest instead. Rooney's better half posted a picture from the directors' lounge on Merseyside, almost 300 miles from her hubby.",
      "In the end, it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Manchester United legend Rooney. A 2-0 loss at Oxford ended up being his last test as Plymouth chief, and he promptly left the club just two days later.",
      "He departed Home Park with five wins and 14 losses from 25 games in charge. And though not as bad as his stint with Birmingham City, he nonetheless departed Plymouth having failed to build any more credibility as a coach.",
      "Any legacy was only damaged further when his successor, Miron Muslic, did a superior job in his five months as a replacement. The Austrian even suggested Plymouth would have survived had he been appointed sooner.",
      "It was always established that Coleen wouldn't be moving with Wayne to the south coast. Stability for their four young sons remained the priority, though she acknowledged the long-term setup was nothing compared to his time as coach of DC United.",
      "\"We see him a couple of times a week, which is good,\" Coleen told the Sunday Mirror in September 2024. \"He went to America, so this is a bonus because even though it seems like far away, it's easier to get to than Washington, DC.\"",
      "She continued: \"We thought long and hard about it (moving to Devon) but with the kids it didn’t work. Kai’s now in Year 10 and just starting GCSE prep, and everything’s going well with football, and the other boys are all settled at school.",
      "\"So it didn’t seem fair on the children to pick them up and take them away, and start in a whole new place. It’s manageable. It’s life. Other couples and families have similar situations and have to get on with it.\"",
      "One year on from his Plymouth departure, there's no sign of a new coaching position on the horizon for Rooney. However, he may have to pick a position closer to home if he expects his adoring wife to be on hand for the big occasions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United manager Ruben Amorim was without Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt for the game, while Mason Mount also went off injured. Meanwhile, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim switched to a back four and was rewarded when Patrick Dorgu scored his first goal for the club. The United boss also used academy graduates Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson off the substitutes’ bench, which also contained fellow youngsters Tyler Fletcher, Shea Lacey and Bendito Mantato.",
      "United legend Rooney was happy to see his former side hang on and claim three points, which left them sixth in the Premier League, and academy players given a chance to impress, but couldn’t hide his overall feelings. “I was worried when I saw the performance, if I’m being honest,” Rooney said on Match of the Day.",
      "“The manager changed the formation and he went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for. I know they didn’t concede a goal but they didn’t really look comfortable and Newcastle put them under pressure, especially in the second half.",
      "“And when I look at the squad and the bench, what they’ve got there, they really need players in to try and help them to challenge and get into the top four.",
      "“It’s great to see the young players on the bench and getting that opportunity, but it needs to be at the right time as well. It’s not sustainable at all. They need players in. They’ve obviously lost some important players and Bruno is a big loss.",
      "“They had 33 per cent possession in the Newcastle game – and I know when those fans go to Old Trafford they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses into the box and getting shots off. It was a poor performance, but they found a way to win.”",
      "United are understood to be chasing a midfielder in the January transfer window, with Everton’s James Garner and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher among the targets. The club have previously considered Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba after spending £200million in the summer transfer window to bolster their attack.",
      "Amorim has already ruled out panic-buying in January after losing captain Fernandes to injury. “What we cannot do is to reach January and try to do everything in urgency and make mistakes and then [it’s] ‘here we go again’ with a lot of mistakes,” Amorim said last week.",
      "“I’m not going to get [together] with [club chiefs] Jason [Wilcox] and Omar [Berrada] and say: ‘We need a lot of players.’ Because we have a plan.",
      "“If we have to suffer, the club comes first. Of course, we are in a moment where we need points but we need to find solutions and we are going to continue with our plan. You can feel in this moment that we are going to struggle, but we will see. We have to deal with it.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson believes academy players are still the future of Manchester United despite the likes of Scott McTominay and Alejandro Garnacho being sold. Both former Carrington stars have left the club in the last year with fellow academy boy Kobbie Mainoo potentially following suit in January.",
      "McTominay graduated from the United youth team in 2013, working his way up the ranks until he made his senior debut in 2017. The Scottish midfielder made 255 appearances for the club, scoring 29 goals and providing eight assists before moving on to Napoli in 2024.",
      "Former manager Ferguson was full of praise for McTominay during his time at the club. He insisted the playmaker would go on to become one of United's biggest stars.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Man United's big players,\" Ferguson told the Scottish FA in 2021. \"When you watch Man United pick their team for a big game, McTominay's name is in it. He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "Just three years later, McTominay left United and became Italy's newest hero as he helped Napoli win the Serie A title at the first time of asking.",
      "Now, fellow midfielder Mainoo may be following in his former teammate's footsteps and Fergie will likely be left saddened by this. Speaking at a golf event in 2024, the iconic manager insisted that the likes of Mainoo and Garnacho - who is now at Chelsea - are the beating soul of the club.",
      "Ferguson said: \"It's the foundation isn’t it? It's the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They're young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first-team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have.\"",
      "Ferguson's thoughts are clear on the sale of Mainoo from these comments - sell him and you are losing the true meaning of Manchester United.",
      "Despite rumours circling that the England international is set to leave Old Trafford, current boss Ruben Amorim claims he isn't the one who wants to see Mainoo go. Speaking before United's 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, the Portuguese boss insists the midfielder will not leave.",
      "Amorim said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that.",
      "\"If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there. He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's depth in midfield, the 40-year-old added: \"If we are not getting someone, it’s hard to [let Mainoo leave]. We are shorter.",
      "\"Even with a full squad, we are shorter with something that can happen here. We are a club with a big responsibility. We are dealing with all these issues and in everybody’s head, we need to win every game, there are no excuses. So it’s going to be hard to leave the club if we don’t get a substitution.",
      "\"A few days before [his injury], we were talking about Kobbie doesn’t have the minutes he deserves or needs. Then there’s an opportunity, and Kobbie is not there.",
      "\"Sometimes, it is bad luck and during this year, we have some moments with a bit of bad luck.\"",

      "Manchester United are preparing for a crucial period on and off the pitch. The Red Devils secured a hard-fought 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day and another three points over Wolves on Tuesday would end a tough year on a high note.",
      "Ruben Amorim must have wondered whether he would see in 2026 as United boss at one stage, as the team lurched from one disaster to another at the start of the season. However, the Portuguese coach has steadied the ship, with United looking in better shape than 12 months ago.",
      "Next year could be another one of change at Old Trafford, with the futures of numerous players up in the air. With the transfer window looming, here's a round-up of the latest United news…",
      "Roma have submitted an official offer to sign striker Joshua Zirkzee, according to various reports. The Rome club are said to have tabled a loan bid with an obligation to buy.",
      "However, while the Dutchman is evidently not in Amorim's long-term plans, the coach must consider whether he would be prepared to let him go as early as next month, given Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "While a loan offer is believed to have been received, United are said to be taking their time to mull over their options before making a firm decision on Zirkzee's future. The 24-year-old came off the bench against Newcastle but struggled to get into the game as United tried to protect their lead.",
      "Mbeumo of Cameroon and the Ivory Coast's Amad are due to meet in a group match on Sunday, having won their opening games. It's entirely possible that both countries could go deep into the tournament, ruling them out of United action until late January, leaving Amorim and United with a tricky decision to make.",
      "Incoming signing Cristian Orozco has described moving to United as a dream come true. The Colombian teenager is due to join the club when he turns 18 in July.",
      "The Red Devils have cast their net far and wide as they seek to build for both the present and the future. They signed 18-year-old Diego Leon from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno earlier this year and have since moved for Orozco.",
      "The 17-year-old midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF in his homeland and captained Colombia U17s to the South American Championship final in April. The youngster recently visited Manchester and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "He said: \"It went really well, to be honest. I was looking around the city. Everything was beautiful. I was able to see the facilities, the stadium. I'm truly fulfilling a childhood dream. It was a wonderful experience.",
      "\"My expectation right now is to learn English a lot. I realised it’s very important. I want to arrive, learn, and adapt as quickly as possible. That’s what’s required to demonstrate my level there, what I can do.",
      "\"I know that with my abilities, I can be key, with the strength and technique I have. I’m very young and I need to adapt.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been served a harsh dose of reality as speculation continues around his Manchester United future. The 20-year-old has become one of Old Trafford's most discussed figures this season, despite barely featuring on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo hasn't been given a single Premier League start under Ruben Amorim this term and has only started once across all competitions in a shocking Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Despite his limited game time, the England international continues to attract attention from European giants Napoli and Bayern Munich, who are reportedly keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "Mainoo even sought a loan switch late in the summer transfer window, raising doubts about his standing in Amorim's plans. The Portuguese manager insisted this week that the youngster remains integral to his vision for the club, even branding him the \"future of Manchester United\".",
      "But former Premier League striker Dean Saunders believes the hype around Mainoo has spiralled beyond what he's actually achieved, whilst questioning whether Amorim truly means what he says.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Wolves and Wrexham boss said: \"I've never known a player get so much airtime and so much press without kicking a ball. He's in the back pages of the paper every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that and he hasn't started since Grimsby away in the cup when they got knocked out.",
      "\"They were horrendous against Grimsby and I think sometimes, as a manager, you watch that game and you think, 'that's it, he's never playing again. He [Amorim] has played Fernandes in that role with Casimero and he [Mainoo] has not got the chance to play.",
      "\"It won't go on forever, because he's played for England and he's shown his potential. He scored a couple of good goals, but I don't think he does know that position. He [Amorim] has just gone, 'I've had enough of this every day. Mainoo this, Mainoo that. I'll put it to bed by just saying he's not going anywhere.'\".",
      "The harsh assessment stands in stark contrast to Amorim's public support, after the United manager dismissed any talk of a January departure.",
      "He said: \"He's going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling. He just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time. He played in different positions; he can do that [defensive midfield] position, he can play if we play with three, he can play like we play in the last game - the position of Mason Mount in this game [against Villa].\"",
      "Amorim subsequently dismissed speculation about Mainoo departing Old Trafford next month, saying: \"If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave. Even with a full squad we are shorter [in terms of players] for something that can happen here so it's going to be hard for someone to leave the club if we don't get a substitution.\"",
      "However, despite being recently sidelined with a calf injury, there are ongoing queries about why Mainoo hasn't been able to secure a spot in Amorim's starting line-up. Saunders suggests that a short-term loan move overseas could be beneficial for the midfielder, identifying Italy as an ideal place for development.",
      "He added: \"He's shown potential, but this is Man United we're talking about. They're trying to win everything they enter. They're a massive club and in that number six position, you have to smell danger from all angles.",
      "\"I think, for a young lad to learn that, it's difficult unless he's playing every week. I think you're doing good if you go to Napoli or somewhere like that, one of these Italian teams.\"",

Ruben Amorim is also sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount after he limped out of the Boxing Day win against Newcastle United.",
      "United felt they couldn't risk Mount after he complained of feeling tightness against the Magpies, with Amorim already dealing with a significant injury list, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Centre-backs Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain absent, while Kobbie Mainoo won't be fit to face Wolves.",
      "\"I don't know how Mase is going to be for that game,\" said Amorim. \"I think Kobbie Mainoo is not going to be ready. Bruno is not going to be ready. I think Matt is not going to be ready. Harry is not going to be ready. So, I think we are not going to have more players.\"",
      "Fernandes is expected to miss a few weeks of action with a minor hamstring injury, but Amorim revealed he is already asking to get back involved in training sessions at Carrington. Mainoo is set to return to first-team training this week, which could put him in the frame to face Leeds on Sunday, but De Ligt and Maguire face longer on the sidelines.",
      "\"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know,\" said Amorim. \"No chance he is going to play against Wolves, no chance.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is going to start on the [training] pitch also, so we will see. Matthijs is struggling a little bit. Harry the same thing.\"",
      "In his absence, Lisandro Martinez was named captain, but Amorim revealed Fernandes' influence stretches beyond the pitch and praised the way he had continued to back his teammates while injured. The Portugal international has even been watching training after completing his treatment at Carrington.",
      "\"He's always speaking, that's why he's the captain,\" the United head coach said. \"He has bad things sometimes, the way move his arms, but he has a lot of good things.",
      "\"The practice, every time he makes a recovery, he is the guy who is going to watch the other guys' training that day. So there is a lot of things that you guys don't see but that he does. He's a great leader all the time.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there. I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader. The guy is a leader.\"",
      "Wolves are yet to win in the Premier League this season, losing 16 of their 18 fixtures, and United won 4-1 at Molineux earlier this month. The return fixture offers United the chance to end the year on a high and Amorim knows victory is essential.",
      "\"We need to [win], and they show that against Arsenal, they could get at least one point,\" he said. \"So, in the Premier League, you never know. They have their problems, we have our problems but there is no excuses. We need to win, we will try to win the game.\"",

      "Manchester United's back four could be here to stay after Ruben Amorim insisted he wouldn't revert to a back three every week when players return from injury and international duty. Amorim switched shape for the first time as head coach in the Boxing Day win against Newcastle and could stick with it against Wolves.",
      "After showing signs of flexibility for the first time in his 14 months in charge at Old Trafford, Amorim suggested a back four would be for life and not just Christmas, even when key men return over the next few weeks.",
      "Amorim shifted shape with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away on international duty, while injuries have mounted with Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes all on the treatment table. But Amorim insisted he had always planned to evolve during his time in charge and only resisted doing so until now to avoid giving the impression he had caved to media pressure.",
      "He has played the 3-4-2-1 shape, which he had success with in Portugal, almost constantly at United, and felt it was important to use that system to bed in the principles he wants to instil at the club.",
      "\"First of all, it's a process. When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim. \"We are trying to build an identity.",
      "\"Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing. It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\"",
      "Amorim has often stressed that, regardless of the shape, the principles of play will remain the same for his side. However, having finally moved away from a wing-back system, a back four that supporters have been crying out for might be seen more often as his tenure enters a new phase.",
      "That flexibility will also present more headaches to opponents. Newcastle were confused to see United set up in a back four on Boxing Day and took their time to work out what they needed to change.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said.",
      "\"But that was something that I was talking about. But when you talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I'm changing because of you [the media], and, I think, that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"So, when we are playing well in our system, that is the moment to change if it's the better thing to win the game.\"",

      "The thesis on what has gone wrong at Manchester United over the past dozen years or so could make War and Peace look like a children's book, but if there is one area in particular that can be held up as a costly failure, it is recruitment. A failure of joined-up thinking and a lack of diligence have resulted in hundreds of millions being wasted on players who are not up to the task.",
      "In terms of on-pitch success, recruitment is the biggest differential. It explains why United have fallen so far in recent years, but is there light at the end of the tunnel? This year hints at brighter times ahead, and a £245million spending spree across two transfer windows has delivered value.",
      "The £1.5million deal to sign Ayden Heaven in January looks like a steal, and while the jury has been out on the £25million addition of Patrick Dorgu in the same window, he has had his best games for the club in the past week and scored his first goal on Boxing Day.",
      "The summer saw around £218million spent, with Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving. Lammens has been installed as the first-choice goalkeeper after an £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp and has started encouragingly, and Mbeumo has been a revelation after his £71million switch from Brentford.",
      "Cunha is starting to deliver on a consistent basis after his £62.5million move from Wolves, and there have been flashes from Sesko, who is 22 and learning a new league after joining from RB Leipzig for £73million.",
      "That success rate offers encouragement that things are looking up at Old Trafford, with Jason Wilcox now installed as director of football and Ruben Amorim's side starting to deliver on the pitch. Amorim attributes the recruitment to a bit of luck, but also explained that it was now a more collaborative process and that he wasn't just getting his own way.",
      "That is something Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been trying to change since taking charge of football operations after his minority investment, bemoaning the approach of letting managers sign the players they want before then changing the manager and appointing someone with a different style.",
      "\"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason and the board has another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager, because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything. But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player will not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "United have ramped up their data department since Ratcliffe's investment, but as well as crunching the numbers, they are also putting in the work to discover a potential signing's background, and for all the success so far of the recruits under Amorim, he is demanding more from his new boys.",
      "\"We try to make all the assessments of how they live, how they train, the characteristics,\" he said. \"I think we did well but I think they have more to give.",
      "\"If you talk about Cunha, for example, Ayden is a young guy, Cunha and Bryan are our league, so it's easier for them to perform.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to the live Manchester United blog on Monday, December 29.",
      "In less than 72 hours, the January transfer window will open which will allows clubs to both strengthen and trim their squads for the second half of the season.",
      "Antoine Semenyo looked set to be a trending topic throughout the winter trading period with United among those linked. However, he looks to have already made a decision on his future with Manchester City emerging as his preference.",
      "Instead, United may look to add some needed depth to their midfield, especially with Bruno Fernandes out injured. Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been linked and United were handed a surprise boost over the weekend regarding his potential availability.",
      "AZ Alkmaar star Kees Smit is the latest midfielder to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, though several teams are interested. Elsewhere, a final Barcelona decision on Marcus Rashford looms as his positive loan spell continues.",
      "With all of that being said, stay right here for all of the latest news and rumours throughout the day.",
      "We are concluding our live blog coverage for today. Thanks for following and stay tuned for more updates ahead of the January transfer window opening on Thursday!",
      "With Semenyo looking likely to move across Manchester to City, United's January window is starting to look a little bare. The midfield signing/s are being saved for the summer when the market looks a lot better for buying clubs. For now, it is likely to be the case of waiting patiently. As Amorim has said, he is not going to sign anyone who does not fit the long-term vision, let's see if he sticks to his word or not...",
      "Manchester United teammates Bryan Mbeumo and Amad faced off at AFCON on Sunday evening.",
      "The latter scored for Ivory Coast to put Mbeumo's Cameroon on the brink of elimination, but they eventually equalised.",
      "Both nations are now on four points and have all but confirmed spots in the knockout stages. After the game, the pair exchanged shirts with Mbeumo later posting the image to his Instagram story where he captioned it with a heart emoji.",
      "Manchester United have been issued with a clear transfer timeline for Kees Smit amid interest from across Europe.",
      "Real Madrid and Chelsea have been linked while Newcastle United have been keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, the 19-year-old AZ Alkmaar star is 'one to watch' for next summer's transfer window with a deal likely to cost between €40m-€45m (£34.8m-£39.2m).",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has shared his thoughts on the Lisandro Martinez handball incident from Manchester United's win over Newcastle.",
      "The central defender inadvertently blocked a Fabian Schar effort with his arm in the penalty area, though no spot-kick was awarded despite some huge appeals.",
      "Jay Bothroyd did not agree though and stated: \"I don't think that's conclusive. The terminology confused me, they didn't even say it touched his chest.\"",
      "\"I don't even know what 'mutual contact' means. Martinez is grappling. It looks like he's tried to push the defender away, his hands are there and that's an unnatural position.",
      "\"But if they said it hits his body and then his arms, we don't have this conversation now. The terminology is confusing for me. They're digging themselves a hole.\"",
      "While it seems more likely than ever that United will be about to miss out on Semenyo, it is not necessarily unexpected. The Bournemouth man is in demand from across the Premier League and the Reds still have work to do to be a team which can attract the top players ahead of the likes of City, Liverpool, Arsenal etc. While that's not what United fans want to hear, they at least can be thankful Dorgu has rediscovered his form.",
      "The representatives of Antoine Semenyo are expected to be in Manchester today!",
      "Unfortunately, a move to Manchester City remains the likely outcome and is exactly that is what will be discussed.",
      "It has also been stated that City are the only club to have made contact, despite concrete interest from Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham. Chelsea and Arsenal ended their interest for a January move earlier this month.",
      "In case you missed it, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has made it clear he wants the club to sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal.",
      "The England international is currently on loan at Barca and though a final decision will not be needed for a few months, Flick has seemingly seen enough.",
      "According to Spanish outlet SPORT, Flick wants Barca to find a way of ensuring he signs for them permanently.",
      "Manchester United look to have been handed a potential Carlos Baleba transfer boost.",
      "Ruben Amorim tried to sign the Brighton star this past summer but the deal was deemed too expensive. United could subsequently return to the table in January, but will have to wait until he is back from AFCON.",
      "That has been extended following Cameroon's point against the Ivory Coast which almost guarantees he and Bryan Mbeumo will be in the knockout stages.",
      "Baleba had been subbed off with a potential injury in their previous group game but he was in the starting XI and played the full 90 minutes of their 1-1 draw.",
      "Hello and welcome back to MEN Sport's Manchester United transfer live blog!",
      "For all the latest updates on Antoine Semenyo, Carlos Baleba, Marcus Rashford, Kees Smit, Ruben Neves and much more, stay right here for regular updates!",
      "Manchester City are understood to be in pole position to sign Antoine Semenyo in January, but according to The Telegraph, Bournemouth are braced for a late twist which could involve Liverpool.",
      "The release clause in his contract doesn't become active until Thursday. Liverpool haven't made any official move but Richard Hughes' time at Bournemouth could work in their favour.",
      "Galatasaray are planning a 'strategic offer' for Manuel Ugarte in January, according to Fotomac.",
      "A loan deal with a permanent purchase clause is what the Turkish giants want, believed to be worth around €25million. Lyon and Napoli are both keen themselves.",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick has informed the club of his desire to make Marcus Rashford's loan move from Manchester United a permanent one in the summer.",
      "After scoring seven goals and assisting eight this season, Rashford's move to Spain has an option to become permanent at the end of the season. SPORT have claime that Flick wants Barca to find a way of ensuring he signs for them permanently.",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly keen on AS Roma's Manu Kone ahead of the January transfer window, with Caught Offside suggesting a move could happen next month.",
      "Sources have told the outlet that United's move for Kone is seen as part of Amorim's plan to rebuild his midfield. Roma have ruled out a move in January, though a summer exit hasn't been put of the question.",
      "Man United have reportedly opened talks with Auxerre striker Lassine Sinayoko over a January move.",
      "Africa Foot have claimed that United are keen to sign the forward on a free contract when his deal in France expires at the end of the season. He has scored 25 goals in 149 games for the club.",
      "He is currently representing Mali at AFCON and has scored in both of their opening two games.",
      "Despite being used more by Ruben Amorim in recent weeks, Joshua Zirkzee has reportedly given his green light to move to Roma in January.",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that the striker has said yes to a move to the Serie A side. It's said they have tabled a £35million proposal for the forward and have held positive discussions with the Roma hierarchy and head coach Gian Piero Gasperini.",

      "“I was worried when I saw the performance (vs Newcastle), if I’m being honest.",
      "“The manager changed the formation and he went with a back four, which a lot of people have been asking for. I know they didn’t concede a goal but they didn’t really look comfortable and Newcastle put them under pressure, especially in the second half.",
      "“And when I look at the squad and the bench, what they’ve got there, they really need players in to try and help them to challenge and get into the top four.",
      "“It’s great to see the young players on the bench and getting that opportunity, but it needs to be at the right time as well. It’s not sustainable at all. They need players in. They’ve obviously lost some important players and Bruno is a big loss.\"",

      "Speaking in an interview with the Times. he said:",
      "“The main thing at United is just the perception of how you have to play and how you have to be as a player, because everything you do is compared to who was there before,” Eriksen says. “So any position, you’ll be like, ‘Oh yeah, now we have Casemiro but you have to compare him to Roy Keane,’ or, ‘We had [Robin] van Persie here, so this striker now has to be able to do this.’",
      "“So everything at United is like straight away when you wear the logo, you bring all that history with you, you have to follow up what was there before and change that or make it better, which, of course, is almost impossible when you win [the title] eight out of 11 years in the Premier League. So that puts a lot of pressure on the players and then, obviously, when you get into a situation where you change a lot of managers, a lot of structures, then yeah, it’s tough as a player to really succeed.”",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "Manchester United teenage defender Ayden Heaven will not be switching international allegiances from England to Ghana, according to reports this week.",
      "The 19-year-old, formerly of Arsenal, signed for the Red Devils for a nominal fee at the start of the year and made a handful of senior appearances towards the tail end of last season. He made his first-team debut in March in a Europa League clash against Real Sociedad.",
      "This term, Heaven has made several Premier League appearances, five of which have been starts. He recently played the full 90 minutes in a narrow defeat against Aston Villa, and featured against Newcastle on Boxing Day, where he was named the Premier League Player of the Match as Amorim's side kept a rare clean sheet.",
      "So far, the teenager has represented England at various youth levels and earned his first call-up to the Under-20s side in the autumn. He was not selected for the November international break due to injury, but is likely to be included in one of the squads when international football resumes in the spring.",
      "Despite being born in London, Heaven also qualifies to represent Ghana through a grandparent, and his development has understandably been monitored. Under current FIFA rules, players can switch national teams provided they have played no more than three competitive senior games before the age of 21, have not featured in the latter stages of an international tournament and as long as three years have passed since their last senior appearance.",
      "According to the BBC, Heaven will not be switching allegiances to represent Ghana, with the World Cup fast approaching. Although Ghana did not qualify for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, they did book their place at next summer's tournament in the United States and have been drawn in a group with England, Croatia and Panama.",
      "The article notes that Heaven wants to represent England at senior level and force his way into the first-team squad, a feat he will surely achieve so long as he continues on an upward trajectory at United.",
      "Heaven has earned the praise of manager Ruben Amorim this season, with the Portuguese coach highlighting the youngster's attitude and application in training. \"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" he told the media recently.",
      "\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game.",
      "\"He trained really well. If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "United return to action on Tuesday night with their final match of 2025 at home against Wolves. They will then start the new year with an away trip to Leeds this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has made a strong impression during his loan spell at Barcelona, with the majority of the Catalan club's supporters keen for him to be signed on a permanent basis next summer, according to a poll conducted by a Spanish media outlet.",
      "Rashford moved to the La Liga heavyweights in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing on a deal that includes an option for the Spanish club to make the move permanent at the end of the season. To retain Rashford beyond May 2026, Barca would need to fork out approximately £26 million.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under manager Hansi Flick. His impressive form has put him in the running for an England call-up for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Reports from Spain suggest that Flick is eager to keep Rashford at the club and efforts are underway to secure a deal.",
      "A poll conducted by Mundo Deportivo revealed that 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would support the club in exercising the purchase option in Rashford's loan deal. A small fraction, 6.3 per cent, believe that sporting director Deco should wait until the end of the season before making a decision.",
      "This leaves nearly 40 per cent of fans opposed to the idea of signing Rashford on a permanent basis.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Rashford himself seems to be enjoying life at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy graduate has spoken about his future aspirations with the club.",
      "In an interview with SPORT, he said: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",
      "\"For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies. Last season was fantastic, but in life, everything happens very quickly, things change, and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this.",
      "\"With the staff and the teammates, everything is fantastic, I can't complain. Of course, what I want is to stay at Barca. It's an end goal, but it's not the reason why I'm training hard and giving it my best.",
      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "During his Christmas break whilst La Liga paused for winter, Rashford distributed gifts to youngsters at two Barcelona Foundation centres. The striker revealed: \"I grew up in this type of environment.",
      "\"I always knew from a young age that if I was ever in a position or situation to help [I would], especially people that I see myself in.",
      "\"It's very important. We have to understand as much as we can from them because they are the future of everything If we can give them the best opportunities, it's the right thing to do.\"",

      "When Antoine Semenyo scored in the eight-goal thriller at Old Trafford earlier this month, he proved exactly why Manchester United and several other Premier League clubs had been monitoring him ahead of the January transfer window. The 25-year-old is exactly what top teams want from a player these days.",
      "He can play in multiple positions, he's quick and knows how to finish. What more could Ruben Amorim or any other manager ask for? Not only that, he also has a release clause which essentially guarantees his exit at the turn of the year.",
      "£65m for a player like Semenyo could not be overlooked, hence why United entered the race despite spending more than £200m upgrading their attack in the summer. Sadly for the Reds, their chances of signing Semenyo look slim.",
      "Manchester City are looking to wrap up a deal for the Bournemouth star. It would be a blow to miss out on a player like Semenyo, but not as big a blow as it would have looked a few weeks ago.",
      "Questions have been asked about Patrick Dorgu in recent months. Before the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), he had been replaced on the left flank by Diogo Dalot, despite the Portugal international being more suited to the right. Dorgu needed to step up and he has done just that.",
      "Against Aston Villa and Newcastle, Dorgu has enjoyed two of his best performances in a United shirt. Full credit must go to the wing-back, considering we have seen players more experienced than him shrink when they have been in the firing line for criticism.",
      "Amorim spoke about Dorgu's struggles in November, saying: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety.\"",
      "Against Newcastle on Boxing Day, anxiety was certainly not an issue. Dorgu produced one of the best goals of United's season to win that game and only a brilliant performance from Ayden Heaven prevented him from taking home the Man of the Match award.",
      "Dorgu would go on to address the aforementioned criticism after the Boxing Day win, stating: \"Of course it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player. And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "This uptick in form is exactly what was needed and softens the blow if United miss out on Semenyo. If United revert to a back three, they know Dorgu can offer a threat down the left flank, as Amad has on the right.",
      "It is an unexpected boost for the Reds but certainly one they will be thankful of as they head into the January fixtures.",

      "Ruben Amorim would have been under no illusions as to the challenges facing him when he took on a job the size of Manchester United just over a year ago. But he was perhaps not ready for the constant headaches he would have to deal with. The nature of United means there are very few quiet days.",
      "At the moment, he is currently juggling several issues. An injury crisis is plaguing his team with absentees across the defence and midfield stretching the squad to the maximum. Speculation surrounding the future of Kobbie Mainoo continues to rattle on as does talk of Bruno Fernandes leaving.",
      "This is on top of the everyday challenges of pushing this club back to the heights they once reached. But one topic which has gone under the radar in the past couple of weeks is the contract situations of Casemiro and Harry Maguire.",
      "Both men will be free agents at the end of this season, as things stand. The Brazilian has a clause in his contract which United can utilise to extend his stay in Manchester but Maguire will need to agree to a new deal if he is to stay beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire and Casemiro can both negotiate with overseas clubs freely from the start of January as they enter the final six months of their current deals. In his pre-Newcastle press conference on Christmas Eve, Amorim was asked by MEN Sport if any further talks had taken place with the duo over their Old Trafford deals.",
      "\"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do,\" Amorim responded. \"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing.",
      "\"So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will think just think about the next game.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Whether more is going on behind the scenes than we know remains to be seen, but at least in the case of Maguire, the decision could be being made easier by Ayden Heaven.",
      "The Arsenal academy graduate traded the Emirates Stadium for Old Trafford last January. A matter of weeks prior to that switch he made his first-team debut for the Gunners against Preston North End in the Carabao Cup but it was clear this would be the exception, rather than the rule.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are Mikel Arteta's first choices when fit, regardless of who is coming through the academy. Clearly, Heaven felt chances would be easier to come by in Manchester and so it has proved.",
      "In the first half of the year, he was called upon four times in the Premier League. An injury picked up against Leicester City scuppered his momentum and it was obvious this season would be a big one for him.",
      "When he was initially brought in to cover injuries, he underwhelmed which was to be expected given he is still only 19 and he had not played much football since the injury at the King Power Stadium.",
      "But in recent weeks, with Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt out, Heaven has impressed. Against Aston Villa he shone in the centre of the back three and again on Boxing Day, he showed maturity above his years.",
      "The Englishman is starting to look fully at home in the defensive line and his form is beginning to alleviate the pressure surrounding Maguire. Amorim will be the first to say Maguire is more than just a competent defender, he is part of the leadership group and this cannot be understated.",
      "However, Heaven is showing on the pitch he is capable of performing to the required level, even though he is still a teenager. He is a realistic successor to Maguire.",

United were down to the bare bones after losing Mason Mount at half-time and they had to hold on during a second-half onslaught to earn a 1-0 win that temporarily moved them into fifth in the Premier League.",
      "Although United have produced more convincing performances under Amorim, the Portuguese head coach hailed it as one of his best wins during his 13 months in charge and insists the spirit they showed could be valuable in spreading belief through the squad.",
      "Asked if the win was one of his most enjoyable, he said: \"Yeah, especially if you see the second half, we managed to defend sometimes with a back six, but we suffer together, and that is a good feeling. I felt we are here talking about the game, and if we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games. We need to feel we can win games without playing so well and win with spirit and togetherness.\"",
      "It was just a second clean sheet of the season and Amorim felt the luck was on United's side against Newcastle when it has deserted them at other times this season. \"The feeling is good but if you compare to other games we suffered so much more today, but in certain moments we put everything on the line,\" he said. \"We’re defending every cross, trying to push out the box, that is a good feeling to have but we had so many games we controlled much better and conceded a goal.\"",

      "A few months ago, Ruben Amorim said even the Pope couldn't convince him to change his system at Manchester United, but on the second day of Christmas, he gave in to popular demand. If a back three is United's past, then could this back four be their future?",
      "Amorim had been teasing the idea of a change of shape in recent weeks and had worked on it in training, so the ghosts of Christmas hadn't visited him in his sleep and brought about an epiphany, yet however it came about, Old Trafford delighted in the reversion to a flat back four and the end of wing-backs.",
      "There is enough material from the past 13 months to give Amorim nightmares, but this change in formation delivered a change in fortunes as well. After six weeks of blowing chance after chance to go fifth in the Premier League, they finally took it. It might last for less than 24 hours, but it shows that this side is in the hunt for a Champions League spot, even if they spent almost the entire second half on the back foot.",
      "When the teamsheets dropped at Old Trafford, it didn't look like it was the night when Amorim changed his ways, but Patrick Dorgu was right-wing rather than left-wing back. That change caught Newcastle by surprise.",
      "On the touchline, Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall debated a solution, while the Newcastle analysts sat in the press box tried to work out what was happening. The shrugging of shoulders showed they hadn't been expecting this.",
      "A few weeks ago, Amorim had talked of the anxiety he could feel whenever Dorgu was on the ball, so when he watched his left-wing-back-cum-right-winger settle over a dropping ball 16 yards from goal, he probably didn't expect to see a sweetly struck volley whizz past Aaron Ramsdale and into the corner of the net.",
      "Dorgu visibly grew in confidence after that. He forced Ramsdale into a smart save soon after and contributed defensively with one thunderous tackle on Lewis Hall that earned a chest bump from Casemiro, but the loss of Mason Mount to injury at half-time turned this into a rearguard effort.",
      "Fabian Schar saw a shot deflected just wide from a corner and was furious when Newcastle were denied a penalty when his shot was blocked by the arms of Lisandro Martinez. Lewis Hall hit the bar from distance and Anthony Gordon dragged a shot narrowly wide.",
      "United's attacks were few and far between. Benjamin Sesko clipped the top of the bar with a left-footed shot in his last action before being replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, part of a double change that saw Leny Yoro come on, giving the hosts the chance to drop into a back six when required.",
      "And it was needed regularly as Newcastle piled on the pressure. Diogo Dalot and Dorgu were wingers dropping in at full-back as Yoro and Luke Shaw went narrow.",
      "Senne Lammens saved from Joelinton and plucked a cross-shot from Joe Willock out of the air. Anthony Gordon should have done better than swiping a shot over after good work by Harvey Barnes, Schar looped a header onto the roof of the net and then Lewis Miley fired wide from 12 yards.",
      "It summed up Newcastle’s wastefulness in the final third as wave after wave of attack came to nothing. It wasn’t convincing from Amorim’s side, especially after the break, but after four successive defeats without Bruno Fernandes in the Premier League, victory was all that mattered.",
      "Fernandes was in the directors' box to watch his teammates go into battle without him. Amorim had talked of how difficult it was to replace the captain on Christmas Eve and with Mount missing as well, United's creativity is being tested. That this game finished with Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson on the pitch, as well as the lesser-spotted Tyrell Malacia, said everything about the resources Amorim now has at his disposal.",
      "He will need to continue to find solutions over the next few weeks, but the fist-pumps that greeted this victory showed how valuable it was, and the sight of Lisandro Martinez blowing kisses to the Stretford End was a reminder that at least one key man is back in the groove. The Argentine was vital to this defensive effort and proved to be the perfect stand-in for Fernandes.",

Altay Bayindir, Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee and Tyrell Malacia were the only first-team options on the bench.",

      "\"Listen, it's great to see the young players on the bench and getting opportunities, but it needs to be at the right time as well, and it's not; it's not sustainable at all. They need players in. They've obviously lost some important players, and Bruno [Fernandes] is a big loss.\"",

      "He continued: \"The home games under Amorim, you look at the possession from the Newcastle game, 33 per cent at Old Trafford, I know when the fans go to that stadium they want to see the team with the ball, they want to see them entertaining, getting crosses in the box and getting shots in. It was a poor performance, but they found a way to win.\"",
      "Amorim has also acknowledged that the team did not play very well. He said after the match: \"We played two games in one. We had to suffer, all together, in the stadium and in the game.",

      "Football coaching can be a lonely pursuit at the best of times, never mind when facing the potential of being fired. So it's understandable Wayne Rooney may have felt somewhat abandoned when his wife, Coleen, was conspicuously absent as he faced his dismissal at Plymouth this time last year.",
      "It was almost exactly one year ago that Rooney took charge of the Pilgrims for the final time. The Devon side journeyed to Oxford on December 29, 2024, in dire need of points to boost their Championship survival chances against a similarly struggling opponent.",
      "Many managers might anticipate seeing family in the crowd for moral support during such pivotal moments. However, Coleen was noticeably absent during Rooney's crucial match.",
      "Instead, she was enjoying some festive football at Goodison Park, where she watched local club Everton play against Nottingham Forest. Rooney's other half shared a photo from the directors' lounge on Merseyside, nearly 300 miles away from her husband.",
      "Ultimately, it turned out to be the final straw for Manchester United legend Rooney. A 2-0 defeat at Oxford proved to be his last challenge as Plymouth boss, and he left the club just two days later.",
      "Rooney exited Home Park with a record of five victories and 14 defeats from 25 matches at the helm. Although not as disastrous as his tenure with Birmingham City, he nonetheless left Plymouth without having enhanced his reputation as a coach.",
      "He then took another hit when replacement Miron Muslic proved far more effective during his five-month tenure. The Austrian coach even hinted Plymouth might have staved off relegation had he been brought in earlier.",
      "It was always understood Coleen wouldn't be relocating with Wayne to the south-west. Providing stability for their four young sons remained paramount, although she recognised the arrangement was far more manageable than during his stint with DC United.",
      "\"We see him a couple of times a week, which is good,\" Coleen revealed to the Sunday Mirror in September 2024. \"He went to America, so this is a bonus because even though it seems like far away, it's easier to get to than Washington, DC.\"",
      "She added: \"We thought long and hard about it (moving to Devon) but with the kids it didn't work. Kai's now in Year 10 and just starting GCSE prep, and everything's going well with football, and the other boys are all settled at school.",
      "\"So it didn't seem fair on the children to pick them up and take them away, and start in a whole new place. It's manageable. It's life. Other couples and families have similar situations and have to get on with it.\"",
      "Twelve months after his Plymouth exit, there's little indication of a new managerial opportunity emerging for Rooney. Nevertheless, he might need to consider roles nearer to home if he wants his devoted spouse present in future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told Ayden Heaven his place in the Manchester United starting XI is safe if he continues the rich vein of form he has shown in the last couple of games. The 19-year-old has started five games in a row for United and has raised his performance levels during that run, producing an outstanding display in a rearguard defensive effort in the 1-0 win against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Heaven, a £1million signing from Arsenal last January, has had to be patient for his chance this season but he has taken it when the opportunity arrived and was selected ahead of Leny Yoro against Newcastle. The teenager was named man of the match on TV as United showed tenacity in the second half and Amorim was delighted with the youngster's display.",
      "\"Really pleased with Ayden, he’s improving every game,\" he said. \"He’s young but you don’t feel he has a good game and slows the thinking. \"He was not playing but he trained really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. If he continues to play like that it’s going to be hard to take his place.\"",
      "Heaven started in a back four against the Magpies and that meant Patrick Dorgu reverted to right-wing, netting his first goal for the club with a stunning volley. It was his best performance since joining United last January and Amorim felt the freedom afforded the Denmark international in a more advanced role played into his hands.",
      "\"It’s the normal life of a player, sometimes you are in a good moment, sometimes you struggle. It depends on the team or the game,\" the United head coach said. \"Maybe the game today, with a lot of transitions, is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball. He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "Amorim also reserved praise for Lisandro Martinez, who captained the team in the absence of Bruno Fernandes and on his first start since February 2.",
      "\"He’s a guy with a lot of character, really good on the ball, he won the World Cup, he’s used to that stress and showed today he is a top player,\" he said. \"He’s a small guy but today he did really well against a team who has tall players.\"",

      "Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes has already approved a Ruben Amorim transfer target, as the Red Devils line up a former player this January transfer window.",
      "United are reportedly interested in re-acquiring the services of Everton midfielder James Garner. Other names on the list include Nottingham Forest's England international Elliot Anderson, who has been in fine form this season. However, the Daily Mail is reporting that Garner is moving up the priority list, with the player already having the approval of captain Fernandes.",
      "There are set to be huge changes made to the United midfield over the next two windows, with Casemiro, Fernandes, Toby Collyer, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all linked with a move away.",
      "Future planning aside, United are struggling for numbers in the middle of the park right now, with Lisandro Martinez, a centre-back, playing there off the bench against Aston Villa recently. Injuries to Fernandes and Mainoo will prompt Amorim to dip into the January transfer market to acquire reinforcements.",
      "Garner, whose Everton contract expires in the summer, could be a shrewd acquisition for United, with the player spending four years on the books at United, although most of his time was spent out on loan.",
      "Everton are trying to negotiate a new deal for Garner, who has impressed at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, but it's understood United may try to get their man in January.",
      "It has now re-emerged that skipper Fernandes thinks very highly of Garner, and you'd imagine the Portuguese superstar would be keen to see the Birkenhead-born player return to Old Trafford.",
      "In an exclusive Q&A on the Manchester United website in 2021, Fernandes spoke about how much the younger players impressed him during pre-season.",
      "\"I think we know some of them already,\" began Fernandes. \"Jimmy Garner, I think is a really good player, I really like him and the way he kicks the ball.",
      "\"He’s really aggressive off the ball too. [Anthony] Elanga was already playing with us and this pre-season he has been brilliant. He’s a nice kid, works hard and is really humble and I think he’s deserving of everything that’s happening to him. I see a brilliant future for him and Jimmy too, and also for all the other kids.\"",
      "Posting to X in 2022, Fernandes was asked by a fan which player from the academy he really looks forward to playing with one day, to which he identified Garner.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Should he move to the Etihad, he would join a Premier League title contender and feature in the Champions League. On the other hand, a move to Old Trafford would see him join the biggest club in the country, but one without European football and not guaranteed to have it next season.",

      "Wolves continue to lose, yet they have competed in spells under Rob Edwards and should find opportunities against a United defence that has rarely looked settled. That makes backing United to win while conceding a goal a sensible middle ground.",
      "Man United to win and both teams to score appeals here, especially given Wolves’ tendency to stay involved before eventually falling short.",
      "Goals also look likely at both ends. United’s matches have rarely stayed tight, while Wolves’ defence continues to give up chances in volume. Over 2.5 goals fits the pattern of how both sides’ games have played out across the season."

      "He said: “When I came here last season, I understood maybe I don’t have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of a process.",
      "“We were trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don’t have a lot of players, and we need to adapt, so they understand why we are changing.",
      "“It is not because of the pressure of you guys [media], or the fans.",
      "“When you [media] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand I’m changing because of you and I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "“When we are playing well in our system, that is the moment to change.",
      "“We are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play with three defenders all the time.”",
      "Fernandes’ injury might not last very long, though Amorim has confirmed he’s going to be out for the next game.",
      "He said: “Bruno is already saying he needs to train. But there is no chance he is going to play against Wolves. No chance. You can write that.”",
      "Meanwhile, Dorgu is likely to stay on the right-wing, and has revealed the role is not difficult for him.",
      "He said: “I’ve done that at my old team as well, so it’s nothing new to me. I knew already a few days ago, so I just tried to remember how to play there.",
      "“It’s the same [as wing-back], just you come inside to your stronger foot, so sometimes it’s even easier to attack and connect with the team-mates, so I find it really easy.”",

      "It has been reported that ‘sources close’ to Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo fear he is ‘making a mistake’ by choosing Man City over Man Utd.",
      "The Ghana international has been the subject of interest from many of the top clubs in the Premier League with Man City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Man Utd interested in Semenyo.",
      "However, news emerged last week that Semenyo had chosen Man City as his ‘preference’ in the January transfer window with the Citizens prepared to trigger his £65m release clause.",
      "There had been reports of a potential hijack from Liverpool but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed overnight that Man City ” remain convinced” they will seal a deal.",
      "Romano said: “In the last hours today, we had stories coming from England about Liverpool trying to hijack the deal for Antoine Semenyo.",
      "“What’s the situation now? Liverpool have always been calling for Semenyo. They started calling in November, they continued calling before Christmas, and they kept on calling during the recent days to understand the situation.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Villa ‘genius’, ‘irrelevant’ Howe, Raya, Nuno sack, Man Utd and Liverpool",
      "“But I can guarantee to you that as of Sunday night, Liverpool have never approached Bournemouth to start a conversation or to tell them: ‘Okay, we’re going to pay the release clause.’",
      "“This didn’t happen because the player’s preference is to go to Manchester City. Man City remain convinced that Semenyo wants to join them and they will try to seal the deal for Semenyo as soon as possible.",
      "“His £65 million release clause is valid until 10 January, so City and Bournemouth will be in contact again over the next few days to try to close the deal for Semenyo.",
      "“Liverpool are calling on the player’s side to understand the situation, but at the moment they are just calling. If Liverpool go into action for the hijack, I will let you know.",
      "“Man City have an agreement with Semenyo, and Man City are talking to Bournemouth – something that Liverpool, as of today, are not doing.”",
      "But The I Paper insists that ‘sources close to Semenyo believe he is perhaps making a mistake in joining City, given he would not be a guaranteed starter’.",
      "Whereas at Man Utd he would be a ‘perfect fit for Ruben Amorim’ with the report adding: ‘If the besieged United boss sticks with his beloved 3-4-3 system, Semenyo could slot in as an attacking wing-back, on the opposite flank to Amad Diallo.’",
      "On Man Utd looking for an alternative, the newspaper adds: ‘The deal is not signed yet, but City are confident they have won the race. United will therefore try look for an alternative, but they were interested in Semenyo as an individual – they will not necessarily look for another wide option.’",
      "Former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson has revealed how the Citizens can afford a deal for Semenyo “no problem” in the January transfer window.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I would expect them to be able to do the deal no problem, but to be looking to move players on either in January or, of course, in the summer.",
      "“I think the list of candidates is pretty clear. That said, a couple of those players who I would say are likely candidates, players like Rico Lewis and Savinho, were players that they had the opportunity to sell last summer and decided not to, so we’ll see.",
      "“But I think they can do the deal now on Semenyo. I would caution as to whether they can do many more deals without selling.”",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports.",
      "Man City are edging closer to sealing a deal to sign Liverpool and Man Utd target Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists that Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo is still likely to sign for Man City over Liverpool in January.",
      "Paul Merson has backed Antoine Semenyo to head to Tottenham rather than Manchester City, amid a question over Pep Guardiola and the potential role the forward would play.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool are ‘still alive’ for AFC Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, but they ‘fear’ missing out on the Manchester City-bound winger.",

      "Speaking of Ronaldo previously, Messi said: “We try to achieve the best every year for our team, and what is said outside of that I don’t think is very important. He is a phenomenal player with a lot of quality. All the world knows, and that is why he is one of the best of the world.”",
      "While Ronaldo once admitted of Messi: “Of course I have affection for Leo Messi. We’ve been on stage together for 15 years. I remember translating English for him at the Galas because he didn’t speak English well. He always treated me well and respected me.”",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 10 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made as many saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet following at Brighton.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham before returning to help beat Man Utd. The win at Chelsea was his quietest afternoon for a while, with only three shots to save.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale, though, has hardly made the place his own so Pope could be back quickly now he’s fit.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. A clean sheet at Palace should do wonders for Vicario and Spurs before their next collective shambles.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a penalty save at Wolves – even if he conceded it – sees the Irishman climb towards respectability.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs.",
      "",

But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",

      "But the potential departure of Joshua Zirkzee and the fact that injuries could scupper the side means they are keen to add other options.",
      "According to Caught Offside, Hoffenheim’s Ivorian winger Bazoumana Traore is ‘rapidly emerging’ as one of the ‘most closely monitored young attackers’ in Europe.",
      "He is on the radar of United, as well as Brentford, Arsenal and Newcastle, all of whom are said to have made initial background checks and done data-driven scouting on the winger.",
      "Scouts from the aforementioned sides are said to have been ‘particularly impressed’ by Traore’s ability to operate in transition-heavy systems.",
      "While he has largely played as a left-winger, Traore has also played in a less advanced role during his career.",
      "So far this term, the Ivorian has two goals and five assists in 14 Bundesliga games, with his assists tally already the best of his career.",
      "While there are other clubs on the scene for Traore, that he plays in the same national team as Amad could help United to convince him Old Trafford is the place he should land at.",
      "However, while he’s in good touch at club level, there could be a question over whether he’s ready to play for United, and what role he’d play there.",

      "But with Amad playing in a less advanced role himself at United – generally as the right wing-back – Traore might not get the minutes he has been doing at Hoffenheim.",
      "Whether offers come in for him remains to be seen. The report states that the German club would ask for €45million (£39.3m), reflecting his ‘potential and the leverage provided by his long-term contract.’",
      "It feels unlikely that United would pay that for a player they don’t actually need, especially as their priority is to improve their midfield, either in January or in the summer.",

      "",
      "When the match-winning substitute can give a lucid and precise description of his manager’s “tactical genius” immediately after such a euphoric and ludicrous victory, it really does underline how ridiculous a job Unai Emery has done at Aston Villa.",
      "“He changed it,” Ollie Watkins said, “because Chelsea were going man for man but they had the extra centre-back when we were going long.",
      "“So when I came on second half he brought Sancho on the wing and Morgan [Rogers] and I think it gave us a little bit more space and then put Youri [Tielemans] in the No. 10 so we had an extra body up there.”",
      "It was the response to a simple enough soft ball of a post-match question – “what did the manager say to you when you were brought on, and what kind of impact did he want you to make?” – but it emphasised how deeply Emery has imprinted his thoughts, words and ideals on this squad.",
      "The most points from losing positions. The most goals scored by substitutes. And a longer winning streak than all but seven clubs have ever put together in Premier League history. All engineered by one of the biggest manager upgrades ever.",
      "",
      "Attack wins you games; defence wins you titles; goalkeepers do the rest and probably aren’t noticed until they drop anything resembling a clanger.",
      "Raya will know that from the criticism he faced after what remains the only game this season in which he has failed to save any of the shots he has faced.",
      "Those are the standards set and maintained by the keeper who has faced the fewest shots on target of any who have started more than one-third of their club’s Premier League games this season, but whose save percentage is the fourth-best in the division.",
      "Few have such a reduced margin for error and as unforgiving a role as the final barrier for such a defensively phenomenal side which rarely gives up chances. Raya’s mentality and focus in that sense is as important as his ability for Arsenal.",
      "And that save from Yankuba Minteh, his second and last of the game in that brief window during which his side otherwise lost control, underlined it: Raya needed elite reflexes, level of concentration and even speed of thought in choosing which hand to use to optimise his chances of keeping the ball out.",
      "The only thing processed quicker was the replay which was immediately added to his remarkably highlights package of equally impressive and important saves in the last few seasons.",

      "But even after a third remodelling of their frontline in consecutive seasons, Brentford’s overhauled output continues to excel. The only club with two players in last season’s 10 top Premier League scorers sold both and can still match Manchester City with a pair of representatives in 2025/26’s top 14.",
      "Neither Kevin Schade nor Igor Thiago are perfect. The former is infuriatingly consistent, while the latter often makes the wrong decision in his final action. But their basic ingredients are tantalising, as was showcased as they summarily dismantled Bournemouth.",

      "Ruben Amorim has often referred to restoring “the feeling of winning” as being something elevated beyond the actual art of victory itself over the past year.",

      "The Portuguese appears to have at least inherited the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag knack of absurdly elongating a reign by spacing his wins impeccably, like a nurse overseeing a deliberate deterioration in a patient’s health specifically to keep them on life support while explaining to their loved ones that there’s nothing they can do because the ludicrously expensive medication has to be administered in one needlessly exact, sub-optimal and inflexible way.",
      "Manchester United have not been beaten in consecutive games all season – in either the Premier League or all competitions – and have not lost from a winning position since May.",

      "It doesn’t bear thinking what atrocities would have been inflicted on a defence of Dalot, Yoro, Fredricson, Heaven and Malacia behind a midfield of Cunha, Fletcher, Ugarte and Dorgu last season. But this version of the club, for all its myriad faults, has undoubted “spirit”.",
      "",
      "A third straight win. A fourth assist to sit nicely alongside Harry Wilson’s five goals in what is rapidly becoming a standout individual season. A current top-half spot for a club which had spent the entire campaign waiting for the graphic to switch to show those 11th and below.",

      "If the general theme of the festive schedule’s results was of teams either reinforcing or rediscovering how to win in any circumstance, it is one Liverpool followed so faithfully as to almost squander a two-goal lead against perhaps the worst team to ever grace the Premier League.",
      "The teams in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th all won their games on December 26 and 27 by a single goal; Liverpool should take solace in doing so against a side both Arsenal and Aston Villa have struggled to beat recently.",

      "For three seasons the closest player to matching Erling Haaland’s rate of goals and assists per 90 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester City was De Bruyne. And the only time he came within touching distance was when the Belgian played fewer than half of Haaland’s minutes a couple of seasons ago.",
      "This might not be a rate Cherki can maintain – and he has similarly been given a fraction of Haaland’s minutes. But this is the strongest challenge the Norwegian has ever had from a Manchester City teammate (1.27 to 1.34) and Pep Guardiola must be loving it.",

      "The American’s run and pass for the equaliser against Sunderland marked his third assist in seven Premier League games, matching the tally from his first 46.

      "Drawing with Chelsea having led was frustrating; a second straight 1-0 defeat away at a bitter rival is lamentable. Their own mild selection problems notwithstanding, Newcastle should be ashamed at failing to breach one of the more vulnerable Manchester United sides Old Trafford has seen.",
      "But then Howe believes the specific stadium at which Newcastle flatter to deceive on any given matchday to be “irrelevant”. He wants to “look at the performances in isolation” and focus on “what the team’s identity is on that day and how it plays”, as if that would be in any way less damning.",
      "“If it’s home or away, for me, I don’t really care,” added a man who really ought to. The only club with a greater disparity between their home and away results is Brentford, who sit above Newcastle in the table despite being hypocritically bullied by them in the summer.",

      "And this is as sustained a slump for the manager as it is the team: in a table of Premier League results since February 1, when Forest apparently sacrificed their soul for a 7-0 thrashing of Brighton at the City Ground, a bottom four of ever-presents reads: Spurs, Nottingham Forest, Nuno Espirito Santo (32 points), West Ham and Wolves.",
      "It would be grounds for a sacking if the best conceivable replacement candidate hadn’t a) been sacked by West Ham before, b) contributed to a relegation in his last Premier League post more than five years ago and c) hadn’t literally already been rejected by the club a few months back.",
      "",
      "Given the “what a team” head pat by Pep Guardiola and the physical runaround at a decisive set piece. But ultimately it doesn’t feel like making two substitutions in an exhausting game with in-form Manchester City, the first of which was in the 88th minute, should really be the precursor to an entire weekend spent blaming the officials.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Neves is out of contract with Al-Hilal in the summer and could therefore be cheap in January or would come free at the end of the season.",
      "It has been confirmed that United have made contact for the midfielder, but reports in Spain suggest Neves is instead looking for a move to Real.",
      "Defensa Central reports Neves is willing to ‘make a significant financial sacrifice’ in order to join Real.",
      "He is reported to be earning a salary of €18million (£15.7m) in Saudi Arabia, and was willing to drop that to just €6million (£5.2m) to join Real, for a reduction of 66 per cent.",
      "In response to that, his agent, Mendes, reportedly referred to Neves’ decision as “crazy.”",
      "In any case, Real president Florentino Perez is said to be unwilling to sign the Portuguese midfielder.",
      "A move to United also seems unlikely, after Fabrizio Romano poured cold water on it.",
      "The transfer insider said: “Let me be clear, I didn’t post anything on Ruben Neves on my social media, because there is no news on Ruben Neves in terms of negotiations, in terms of bids, in terms of talks.",
      "“What Manchester United did is to be in touch with the agent who also represents Ruben Neves. But Man United didn’t start a real negotiation with Ruben Neves, with Al-Hilal to sign the player.",

      "“Ruben Neves is represented by one of the most powerful agents in football. So that’s something absolutely normal, but nothing has really changed so far.”",
      "Currently, it looks as if Neves would remain in Saudi Arabia until the summer, by which point he’ll be able to walk away on a free transfer, and will surely have some good clubs interested in picking him up.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed there has been contact between Manchester United and Ruben Neves, as he revealed the chances of a move for the midfielder.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",

For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",

It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the potential novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff.",

      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. A home win over Burnley is their only success in five subsequent games, all of which were winnable. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool have at least showed a bit of something.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "And a deeply unconvincing win over Crystal Palace even more so – a result that in deeply Spurs fashion lifted them back to the very top of the away table.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",

      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",

He is quietly (well, not so quietly) showing Manchester United’s wing-backs how to do the job.",

      "Manchester United’s midfield will look very different by the start of next season and this is how we think their rebuild will unfold via seven deals…",
      "To buck recent trends, the Red Devils have been lauded for their transfer business in recent months after a rare positive window in the summer.",
      "As evidenced by this damning list of signings, Man Utd have got plenty wrong in the days following Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, but INEOS steadied the ship with their work on incomings and exits in the summer.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s recruitment team did an admirable job of offloading most of their dead wood on their terms, with this business raising funds for signings in priority areas.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side largely focused on bolstering their attack in the summer, which is understandable given how toothless they were last term, by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They also fixed their goalkeeping department as Senne Lammens replaced one of last season’s many weak links, Andre Onana.",
      "United’s hit rate with these signings was unusually high for their standards, with Sesko currently the only one with dud potential.",
      "All of this has set Man Utd up for an increasingly credible challenge for Champions League qualification this season, but a midfield overhaul is next on INEOS’ to-do list as they look to realise their goal of winning the Premier League title by 2028.",
      "READ: Liverpool in ‘comedy week’ as £30m star ‘better’ than Wirtz as Arsenal ‘totally vilified’, Man Utd lauded",
      "Despite the impressive form of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, central midfield has become a problem area for Man Utd as injuries and a lack of quality options have impacted Amorim’s side.",
      "Also, for various reasons, each of Man Utd’s four main midfield options are facing an uncertain future, and a recent report claimed Fernandes, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte could leave as part of a ‘fire sale’ next year.",
      "So, what will happen with these four players and who will be brought in to replace those who move on?",
      "Well, starting in January, Man Utd’s activity is likely to be limited due to the winter market’s instability and their lack of funds.",
      "But Mainoo would be the one to leave if there are any exits at all due to his reported insistence on having more game time, though this is dependent on Man Utd replacing the England international in the same window.",
      "This prohibited Mainoo from securing a loan move elsewhere at the end of the summer’s window, but Man Utd will have a full month to find a solution that could suit all parties.",
      "Given Man Utd’s financial situation, only a short-term solution is likely in January, and Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, preferably purely on loan, is perhaps their most realistic target to tick a box until the summer.",
      "In this context, the former Chelsea man would be the best like-for-like replacement for Mainoo they could hope for until the summer, with this deal being enough to permit the youngster’s loan to Napoli.",
      "There has also been little indication of Mainoo wanting to leave Man Utd permanently, so in an ideal world, he plays regularly for Napoli for six months and returns to Old Trafford better for the experience.",
      "By which point, he could become a starter for Man Utd alongside Carlos Baleba in what is still likely to be the club’s next long-term midfield pairing.",
      "If Man Utd had their way, Baleba would already be playing in Amorim’s side and in a similar situation to Marc Guehi with Liverpool, it has been reported that the player and club still have their hearts set on each other heading into 2026.",
      "While Mainoo remains the ideal long-term replacement for Fernandes, the same can be said for Baleba and Casemiro, who is also on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite the form and attitude of Casemiro this season, age is not on the Brazil international’s side as he is surely in the final year or two of playing at the top level.",
      "Still, Casemiro’s immense resurgence this term means it is looking increasingly likely that he could remain at Man Utd for at least one more year, with a new deal on lesser terms rather than an extension of his current deal more probable.",
      "It would certainly boost Man Utd if Casemiro sticks around to help with Baleba’s integration in a reduced role currently adopted by Ugarte, who needs to be shown the door next year.",
      "INEOS will hope that the £50m midfielder is one of Man Utd’s last major flops as their rebuild develops, with the former PSG man incredibly limited in possession and clearly not up to the required standard for the club.",
      "It would be to the benefit of player and club if they part ways in January or next summer, which is also the case with Fernandes after the captain fired shots at club chiefs over their alleged push for him to move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes has been Man Utd’s best player over recent years, but they are short of time to cash in on their captain for £60m+ and next summer is perhaps their last opportunity to do so.",
      "READ: Manchester United make hard work of putting in the hard work, but Amorim nails it this time",
      "So, with Man Utd seemingly showing their cards to Fernandes in the summer and the midfielder appearing disgruntled, a natural separation feels more plausible by the day.",
      "Mainoo is right there to fill the void left by Fernandes, but Man Utd certainly could do with another option to share the load and reported target Ruben Neves would fit the bill.",
      "United are said to be lurking over a possible cheap deal in January, but there is a greater chance of a free transfer once his Al-Hilal contract expires in the summer.",
      "With this, plus the cash to come in for Joshua Zirkzee, Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and/or Mason Greenwood, Man Utd would still have funds left over to sign another quality attacker to provide adequate competition and defensive reinforcements.",
      "It really can be that simple…",
      "The sight of Evangelos Marinakis sat seething in his customary City Ground seat on Saturday almost closes a villainous 2025.",

      "Manchester United are reported to be ‘closing in’ on the signing of a Roma midfielder who is said to be a ‘perfect fit’ for the centre of the park.",
      "United‘s preference in the midfield at the moment is the pairing of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. But an injury to Fernandes – who really wants to play further up anyway – and Casemiro’s contract expiring means the Red Devils have been looking to other options.",
      "Indeed, understudies Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have not been given an awful lot of football this season.",
      "Premier League stars Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba are all linked but deemed to be too expensive for a January transfer, and whether or not a midfielder is signed in the winter is a big question.",
      "But the signing of Roma midfielder Manu Kone is picking up pace now, with Caught Offside reporting rumours that United are ‘closing in’ on the signing of the ‘perfect fit.’",
      "They state sources have revealed Kone is part of a plan rebuild the midfield at Old Trafford.",
      "The report also states that Roma have the upper hand, and have ruled out a January exit for the midfielder, who they value at €60million (£52.3m) at the lowest.",
      "Roma are aiming to cash in well due to Kone’s contract running until 2029.",
      "According to recent reports, including from Italian journalist Francesca Teodori, the signing of Kone at United is essentially a certainty.",
      "He said: “It’s not news, but it’s a fairly credible rumour. I’ve been told by multiple sources that he’ll leave Roma in June and join Manchester United.",
      "“I don’t know if this has anything to do with the [Joshua] Zirkzee deal. He might have been included as a sort of counterpart.",
      "“This remains to be seen, but what’s certain is that Kone is very keen on the destination and it looks like he could join United in June.”",
      "Kone has been courted by Premier League sides before, with Liverpool credited with heavy interest in the Frenchman after Jordan Henderson and Fabinho left in the same window.",
      "That was prior to Kone’s move to Roma, where he has impressed enough for big clubs to once again turn their attention to him.",
      "If reports are to be believed, there seems a good chance that we will finally see him suit up in the Premier League soon.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘targeting a shock return’ transfer during next month’s January window before they make a ‘more significant’ signing."

      "This term, the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have helped to increase the goals output, which is now the third best in the league.",
      "Mbeumo is currently away at AFCON, where assisted in Cameroon’s tournament opener – a 1-0 victory over Cameroon.",
      "Mbeumo is not the only reason United have an eye on AFCON, as they will also be interested by the performances of Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko.",
      "Indeed, United are said to have entered into ‘serious negotiations’ with Sinayoko and his entourage, according to AfricaFoot.",
      "Discussions are said to be progressing favourably, with United hoping to finalise a deal for Sinayoko in January, as they are finalising a €3million (£2.6m) salary agreement.",
      "United would be able to land Sinayoko on a free transfer, as his current deal with French club AJ Auxerre is up in the summer, meaning he’d be allowed to pen a deal elsewhere from January for a move at the end of the season.",
      "Should the Red Devils come to an agreement in the winter, that will be ideal, as it’s reported Sinayoko’s talent has attracted interest from several top European clubs.",
      "The forward started AFCON well, scoring Mali’s opening goal of the tournament in a 1-1 draw with Zambia, before also bagging a goal against Morocco in the next game.",
      "That follows on from some good club form this season, with the 26-year-old, who has largely played as a striker this term, having scored six goals and assisted two more for Auxerre this term.",
      "In his last three games prior to heading to AFCON, Sinayoko scored three goals and assisted once.",
      "It will be ideal for United, should the Malian join, that he can play anywhere across the front line, as he’s featured on both flanks as well as up top this term.",
      "As a result, should the form of Cunha and Mbeumo drop, he’d be an option in their positions, but could chiefly rival Sesko in the centre of the attack."

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 14:04, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",

      "Monday 29 December 2025 19:59, UK",
      "Despite being odds-on favourites at Burnley, Newcastle's recent road form suggests this won't be pretty.",
      "Under Eddie Howe, in a season when they are juggling Champions League football, their record away from home in games played when they've only had three days or less to prepare for a game is horrendous. From 18 fixtures they've won just three of those, drawing seven and losing eight. That includes defeats to Luton, Bournemouth, West Ham and Brentford.",
      "Overall, they've managed just one away Premier League win in their last 12 - a run that's been littered with moments of attacking promise but undermined by poor game management and defensive fragility.",
      "The idea of Newcastle being a reliable bet on their travels doesn't quite ring true given the numbers. At 3/1 Burnley are worth a swing on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Enzo Maresca has been proven right. Chelsea are not in the title race.",
      "After beating Burnley on November 22, Chelsea were three points behind leaders Arsenal. They are now 13 points off the pace.",
      "Bournemouth could be just what Chelsea need right now though. Andoni Iraola's team are winless in nine games and have conceded three or more goals in each of their last six Premier League away games as Iraola's unique style is being ripped to shreds by opposition attackers.",
      "Enzo Fernandez isn't the first name most people gravitate towards in Chelsea goalscorer markets, but his underlying data at Stamford Bridge tells a different story. Across his last 10 home games in the Premier League and Champions League, he's averaging 2.3 shots per 90 - the second-highest figure of any player in that sample.",
      "More importantly, Fernandez is leading Chelsea for expected goals per 90 at home (0.4) across those matches. That's a significant marker. He's consistently getting into areas where chances carry genuine threat - meaning the 3/1 with Sky Bet on his anytime price is chunky.",
      "Nottingham Forest may have fallen short in the end against Man City, but their centre-forward Igor Jesus left with an enhanced reputation and with two of Europe's most accomplished defenders knowing they'd been in a proper fight.",
      "Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol, usually so serene in City's defensive structure, spent much of the afternoon retreating, grappling and fouling - four times between them - as they struggled to contain Forest's physical focal point. More of the same foul drawing numbers are expected up against the likes of James Tarkowski and Michael Keane who will approach the challenge of engaging with their usual meeting fire-with-fire style. The Brazilian striker is 11/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled at least twice.",
      "Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct and turn them. And once again they are being vastly overrated by the oddsmakers where they have been chalked up as 11/10 favourites with Sky Bet.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 37 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only three of 18 games otherwise. West Ham are part of that sample size when grabbing a 1-1 draw at the Amex in a clinical and composed performance that was just a few minutes away from landing an away win.",
      "Following the Hammers on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet looks a shrewd move.",
      "Under Mikel Arteta, Arsenal's home matches are defined by fast, aggressive starts. From the first whistle, they squeeze the pitch, dominate territory and look to impose themselves early. That approach has translated into a trend of Arsenal scoring the first goal in 23 of their last 25 home games.",
      "Aston Villa, by contrast, are almost the opposite profile. They're not a side associated with quick starts away from home. In fact, they've scored first in just one of their last 10 away games, often needing time to grow into matches. What they are excellent at is reacting - no team has won more points from losing positions since the start of last season (36).",
      "That tells you everything about how Villa operate: patience first, problem-solving later. Arsenal to score the first goal in the first half at 4/5 with Sky Bet looks a fantastic wager in a game where Villa may come on strong late once again to get a result.",
      "The goal markets suggest we're heading towards a game with around three goals, but it's difficult to see how this contest escalates into anything resembling a shootout.",
      "Yes, Manchester United won 4-1 at Molineux a few weeks ago but United's attacking resources are notably thinner this time around. Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are all absent, which strips creativity and penetration. Without those profiles, United's ability to open up a deep defensive block is far less convincing.",
      "And Wolves will happily lean into that. Expect a very negative, defence-first approach, with bodies behind the ball and minimal ambition in possession. That's hardly surprising when you consider their output this season: just 10 league goals, the fewest of any team across the top four divisions. Goals simply aren't their thing.",
      "Under 2.5 goals is priced as the outsider of the two at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is one of those fixtures where the betting market almost dares you to ignore the most obvious outcome and offers you the biggest price on such an outcome. The draw must be the play here at 23/10 with Sky Bet involving two teams that are neither built to dominate a game and both comfortable in low-risk game states.",
      "Set pieces feel like a key battleground in all Premier League matches now and that's where Anton Stach comes firmly into focus. Leeds have scored more goals from set pieces than any other side in the Premier League this season, while Liverpool sit uncomfortably at the other end of the spectrum, having conceded the most from dead-ball situations. That's a statistical clash you can't ignore.",
      "Stach is on corner-taking duties, which immediately elevates his assist potential. And in games like this, rather than trying to guess which Leeds player finishes the move, it makes far more sense to side with the one delivering.",
      "Stach's role has shifted noticeably in Leeds' 3-5-2 system, with license to operate much higher up the pitch. That tactical tweak has had a clear impact on his output. In his last five games, he's taken 16 shots, effectively doubling his previous shooting numbers, and he's already scored twice from that more advanced position. He is 9/4 with Sky Bet to register a goal or an assist.",
      "Tottenham have the form in the book courtesy of a very routine 2-0 home win over the Bees but the emotional pull of this occasion heavily favours the home side. Thomas Frank was the architect of their rise and his return as the opposing manager will surely sharpen focus rather than distract it. Brentford's players, fresh from an intense and impressive win over Bournemouth, will be keen to prove that the system, not just the coach, still stands strong.",
      "A competitive and awkward contest for Spurs could be on the cards, where their tactical preparation is tested by a Brentford side determined to show they're more than just their former manager - something that's not factored into the prices. A home win looks the play at 5/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side aren't in the business of wild scorelines on their travels. Across City's last 23 away matches, we're seeing an average of 2.6 total goals per game, but that figure is skewed by one total outlier - the bonkers 5-4 at Fulham. Strip that freak result out and the number drops sharply to 2.1 goals per match, which is far more representative of how City manage games on the road.",
      "City don't tend to blow teams away early on the road, instead, they suffocate them. Long spells of possession, territorial dominance and an emphasis on game control rather than relentless attacking risk. There's also the Guardiola festive-period factor, which is impossible to ignore. Between December 26 and January 7, in Guardiola last 16 matches, he's overseen 14 wins and two draws. No defeats. It's a time of year where his teams are drilled, focused and usually a step ahead of opponents. A Man City win and under 3.5 goals is a winner in waiting at 6/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "Monday 29 December 2025 10:58, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title. A number of players are still to return from injury, including Gabriel and Kai Havertz.",
      "Mikel Arteta has always said they will keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal are always looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City have opened talks with Bournemouth to negotiate the finer points of Antoine Semenyo's £65m release clause.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON. They are considering an approach for Tottenham's Brennan Johnson, while Club Brugge's Christos Tzolis was a target in the summer.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Marco Silva did not hide his frustrations about the lack of depth in Fulham's squad after Newcastle knocked them out of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, and he will be hoping to address those problems in the January transfer window.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen after a difficult first half of the season.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham have lost to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is also at AFCON while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Farke has switched to a 3-5-2, but wants his team to be flexible, as shown when he reverted to a back four mid-game against Liverpool and Brentford - a tweak that helped Leeds come from behind to draw in both games - so their plans are not shaped around one formation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Antoine Semenyo's representatives are due in Manchester to finalise contract terms as Manchester City open talks with Bournemouth over his £65m release clause.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United are another club interested in Antoine Semenyo, but look set to miss out to rivals Manchester City. The biggest aspect of the decision for United is with £65m potentially hitting the summer kitty without significant sales.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for players such as Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Johnson, scorer of the winning goal in last season's Europa League final, is of interest to Crystal Palace. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season. Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",

    "date": null,
    "source": "skysports",
    "body": [
      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Rayan Cherki's creativity for Man City and how his form changes the Premier League title picture. Plus: Jeremie Frimpong's pace helping Liverpool and Ayden Heaven's growing reputation at Man Utd",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 11:20, UK",
      "It was not until the start of November that Pep Guardiola left Rayan Cherki on the pitch for over an hour of a Premier League game. The player provided two assists that day against Bournemouth and has started eight of the last nine Premier League games.",
      "Manchester City have won all but one of them to reignite their title hopes and Cherki's role in that has been significant. Most obviously, he scored the winner against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. But his assist for the opener was more typical.",
      "Cherki has provided seven Premier League assists since the start of November, more than any other player in the competition in that time. It is more than twice as many as all but two players - Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Fulham's Harry Wilson.",
      "The difference is that while Fernandes and Wilson are the set-piece takers for their respective teams, all seven of Cherki's assists have come from open play. No other Premier League player has more than three assists from open play during this period.",
      "The key for Guardiola has been getting Cherki in possession of the ball in those areas of the pitch where he can cause the most problems for the opposition. At Forest, although many of those touches were on the right, he was able to do damage centrally.",
      "All three of the chances that he created, including for Tijjani Reijnders' goal, came from forward passes from central positions. Since the start of November, no player in the Premier League has completed more through-balls than the France international.",
      "Tellingly, that game against the Cherries was the first time that Guardiola had named Cherki and Phil Foden in the same starting line-up. It is seven wins from eight in all competitions with them together since then, the twin playmakers proving crucial.",
      "Back in October, the best case for City reclaiming the title relied on Erling Haaland bludgeoning opponents and covering up the flaws in this team. Now, something is taking shape. There is more to this City. Cherki's impact highlights that clearly.",
      "Rob Edwards was encouraged by Wolves' start but about a quarter of an hour into their game at Liverpool, it changed. \"Liverpool began to force us back,\" he explained. \"They changed one or two bits and got a lot of numbers high so it was hard for us to get out.\"",
      "It was around that time that Arne Slot could be seen on the touchline urging Jeremie Frimpong to move higher up. In the latter stages of the first half at Anfield, the nominal right-back played right up against Wolves' back line. It brought the breakthrough goal.",
      "\"Last week, he had the assist against Tottenham and today he had a great assist against Wolves,\" said Slot when discussing Frimpong in the press conference afterwards. \"Pace, that is what he has and that is so important and crucial in modern-day football.\"",
      "He explained: \"To create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces. Now that is not our biggest strength.\" But Frimpong's pace can help them open teams up another way.",
      "He raced past two Wolves players before crossing for Ryan Gravenberch to score. \"Pure individual ability - quick, bam, bam and a cut-back cross. Okay, we were positioned in the right position, but that is the pace I always wanted to bring in in the summer.\"",
      "This was only Frimpong's second Premier League start since his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, injury hampering his first half-season in a Liverpool shirt. \"Now, if he is fit, he can definitely help us.\" The opening goal in beating Wolves showed precisely why.",
      "A word too for Ayden Heaven, who earned Gary Neville's player of the match award in Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven produced eight clearances and one vital block to help preserve a precious clean sheet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's switch to a back four was a major talking point but whatever the formation it seems that the teenage defender has forced himself into the plans. It is now five starts in a row since coming in for the first time this season against West Ham.",
      "\"I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you do not feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game. No, you feel that he is improving during the game.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So in this moment, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "One recalls Hayden being presented to the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford in February following his signing from Arsenal and there being no great sense that he was someone who would have a significant role to play before the calendar year was out.",
      "United lost that game 2-0 to Crystal Palace with Leny Yoro in the team and now Heaven appears to be ahead of the young Frenchman in Amorim's pecking order. Like Yoro, his progress is unlikely be linear. There will be setbacks. But Heaven's reputation is growing.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",

      "Amorim's tactical change to a 4-2-3-1 formation with Dorgu playing on the right wing appeared to confuse Newcastle early on, with Casemiro and Benjamin Sesko going close. And though Eddie Howe did adjust, Dorgu's wonderful volley beat Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The 21-year-old Denmark international has had his struggles since arriving from Lecce last winter but he impressed here even beyond his spectacular goal, although it was Matheus Cunha with his driving runs from deep who lit up the first half at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Heaven (8), Martinez (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (7), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (7), Dorgu (8), Mount (6), Cunha (8), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (5), Fredricson (n/a), Malacia (n/a).\n\n\nNewcastle: Ramsdale (5), Miley (6), Schar (6), Thiaw (6), Hall (7), Guimaraes (7), Tonali (6), Ramsey (5), Murphy (6), Gordon (6), Woltemade (6). \n\n\nSubs: Joelinton (6), Wissa (6), Barnes (6), Willock (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Ayden Heaven.",
      "Although Sesko did hit the crossbar on the counter-attack, Howe's side certainly stepped up the pressure in the second half with Lewis Hall striking the underside of the bar himself. Amorim had Dorgu and Diogo Dalot as his wingers in a 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Dalot even came close to doubling the lead but it was Newcastle pushing - Lisandro Martinez, on his return to the starting line-up, surviving a VAR call for a penalty against him. They lacked the cutting edge to break down a resolute defensive effort.",
      "Manchester United finished this game with a back four of Leny Yoro, Tyler Fredricson, Ayden Heaven and Tyrell Malacia - a trio of youngsters and a left-back making his first appearance of the season. Martinez had earlier shone on his first start.",
      "The midfield two were Jack Fletcher and Manuel Ugarte, the former having come on for the injured Mason Mount at half-time. On the wings were Dalot and Dorgu. Joshua Zirkzee was up front. That Amorim was able to fashion this into a rearguard action that kept out Newcastle was a minor Christmas miracle.",
      "Manchester United won a Premier League game without Bruno Fernandes for the first time since Ralf Rangnick was in charge.",
      "On the night that Amorim changed his formation, something he had once said he could never do, he comes out of it strengthened. By the victory, of course. But, in a curious way, the manner of it too. It was not fluent but resolute. They are battling to improve.",
      "\"We had to suffer altogether in the stadium. It was really difficult for us. We had a good first half and then the second half we just defend and tried to do something with Cunha. We had our opportunities in transitions.",
      "\"It was a good win, but I had so many games here when we played well and didn't get the three points. Today it was the opposite.\"",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet. There has to be pride in your defending.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",

      "\"They have to kick on now. Getting a win under their belts will give them huge belief and confidence going forward.\"",
      "\"Second half a lot better than the first but we didn't do enough. It was not for a lack of effort. Felt if we scored we could have gone on to win the game.\"",
      "Asked if he had been caught out by the change of formation by Amorim, Howe replied: \"Caught out? I actually thought we started the game really well for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "\"But we didn't respond well to the goal. I was disappointed at half time with our inability to grab control of the game because I thought it was there for us to take.",
      "\"I don't think it was a tactical issue for us. I don't think we looked as physically good as we did against Chelsea when we were physically outstanding.",
      "\"I don't think there was a tactical problem for us at any stage of the game. We are disappointed with the way we defended the goal. Long throws were something we prepared for.",
      "\"We are disappointed with our actions in terms of trying to score because we created the chances, put a lot of crosses in their box. The chances were there.",
