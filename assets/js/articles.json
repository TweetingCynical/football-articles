      "Ruben Amorim is facing an injury nightmare for Manchester United's biggest game of the season, with four defenders missing from training. United take on Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao next Wednesday and could be short on players at the back.",
      "The club's season rests on the result in northern Spain, with victory providing salvation in the form of a place in next season's Champions League. United are 16th in the Premier League, a place above Spurs, following the 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Sunday and are fully focused on the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham game extended their winless run in the league to seven games and brought another bitter pill to swallow in the form of another injury for Leny Yoro. The French defender received treatment on the pitch at Old Trafford in the second half and had to be replaced by Harry Maguire.",
      "\"We have to assess Leny in a better way tomorrow,\" Amorim said after the match. \"He felt something, but it could be a small thing.\"",
      "He was due to undergo a scan to determine the extent of the issue and was conspicuous by his absence at an opening training session at Carrington on Wednesday morning. Amorim could be sweating on other injuries, too, with Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven also not presence in the session.",
      "Dalot suffered a calf injury in the 1-0 defeat by Wolves last month and appears very unlikely to make the Spurs game. \"He has something in his muscle, his calf, he had a sequence of games, he played all the time, we try to manage but the players play a lot of minutes and not so ready to cope with that. Dalot felt something,\" Amorim said. \"We don't know how long he's going to be out. But he's out for these next games.\"",
      "De Ligt picked up a knee injury in the 4-3 loss to Brentford, but Amorim had been optimistic about a swift return. \"It is not a big issue,\" he said. \"That is a good thing. He cannot play tomorrow [vs Athletic Bilbao] and he'll not play on Sunday [vs West Ham] but then we'll check day by day.\"",
      "Heaven has not been involved in any squads since being on the bench against Newcastle on April 13 due to a \"small setback\".",
      "Injuries have been a major problem for Amorim during his debut campaign as United boss, with defence a particular issue. Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui all featured against West Ham, but United are short on numbers in defence.",
      "Amorim chose to play a strong side against the Hammers on Sunday, with Bruno Fernandes partnering Manuel Ugarte in midfield. The Portuguese boss admitted that he still had one eye on the Europa League final and had to manage his squad ahead of Friday's trip to play Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League,\" Amorim said. \"Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "If Ruben Amorim gets his way, Manchester United could be transformed over the summer transfer window. Amorim has endured a largely awful reign so far, winning just six of his 26 Premier League games in charge.",
      "While he has led the Red Devils to the final of the Europa League, their dire performance in the top-flight has attracted widespread criticism. Club legend Rio Ferdinand believes that Amorim himself is seeking to move on 50 percent of his squad.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"I think he looks around the dressing room and thinks, 'If I could wave a magic wand, in the next five years at least 50 percent of this team wouldn't be here.'",
      "\"They're not good enough and they're not right for the way he wants to play. I look at him and think that he needs, minimum, two good windows of getting rid of the ones he doesn't require but also getting in players that he really needs.",
      "\"He needs to recruit dynamic athletes. I don't want no mavericks, or players that are frilly and can do pirouettes. No, no, people that can run past and over people as well.”",
      "In a dream world where that change progresses quickly this summer, United would look totally different from this season's under-performers. That change would start in goal, where Andre Onana has been desperately disappointing.",
      "Lille star Lucas Chevalier has emerged as a target, having helped his side to likely European qualification and broken into the France national team squad this season. With two years on his contract, Chevalier is available for around £33.7million.",
      "The defence would be largely unchanged, with a first-choice back three of Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt and Lisandro Martinez emerging once the Argentine returns from his long-term injury.",
      "At right wing-back, Noussair Mazraoui should be given a clean run at the position, with January signing Patrick Dorgu out on the left. In central midfield, Amorim will hope Manuel Ugarte can recover from a difficult debut season to cement his spot.",
      "In a dream scenario, alongside him would be a new face in Adam Wharton. The England international has impressed for Crystal Palace since arriving 18 months ago, earning a ticket to Euro 2024.",
      "He still has four years to run on his contract so a move would be expensive, though Amorim is understood have greenlighted a pursuit of the 21-year-old. In attacking midfield, captain Bruno Fernandes would take one of the two No.10 spots.",
      "The other could be occupied by Matheus Cunha, who looks set to leave Wolves this summer. United are the current frontrunners to sign the Brazilian, who has a £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The final new face comes at striker, with a new forward badly needed after the troubles of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. Liam Delap is Amorim's top target and he could be available for a cut-price fee with Ipswich having been relegated.",
      "Potential Manchester United line-up: Lucas Chevalier; Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Lisandro Martinez; Noussair Mazraoui, Manuel Ugarte, Adam Wharton, Patrick Dorgu; Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha; Liam Delap"

      "United have still managed to reach the Europa League final and will seal a spot back in the Champions League if they beat Tottenham later this month. Regardless of the result, club icon Neville is still expecting a huge overhaul in the squad this summer, with numerous exits expected.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, the former defender said: “You're talking about eight to 10 players have to go. There's three or four players that will leave through being out of contract, and he needs to get [another] five or six out, and they're going to have to pay to get them out.",
      "“Rashford's wages now will be paid half by Manchester United. That's £180,000-a-week, £8million-a-year being paid by United.”",
      "As it stands, four stars are set to leave at the end of their deals, with Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans all seeing their contracts expire in just a month’s time. Tom Heaton also has an expiring contract but reports have claimed that United are keen to keep him at the club for a further year.",

      "Amorim has already revealed his stance on a potential sale of his captain and is determined to keep him at Old Trafford. Speaking in a press conference, he said: \"I think it is easy to understand that [transfer speculation], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays,\" said Amorim in his press conference ahead of Athletic Bilbao.",

      "Fernandes, 30, has just over two years remaining on his current deal at Old Trafford. The former Sporting Lisbon playmaker has enjoyed another sensational season for United this term despite their wretched campaign.",

      "Ashworth has been challenged to 'optimise' the potential of the national football centre and building systems that will 'underpin' the FA's performance targets. That includes creating winning England teams and developing more homegrown coaches.",
      "It marks a return to the FA for Ashworth, with the executive having been the director of elite development and then technical director at the governing body between 2013 and 2019. His return has been hailed by FA chief Bullingham.",

      "“I'm really shocked that this has happened,” he told NBC Sports at the time. “It's not a great look at all and it's something that will need explaining. What's really clear is that there is a fracture here, something has happened.",
      "“You can't bring someone in at the level of Dan Ashworth and then lose him after five months and think something hasn't gone wrong. The fans are now going to ask the question: what's gone wrong? They're going to speculate, it's going to leave huge voids.",

      "“Something like that can't be mutual. I think when Ineos came into Manchester United everyone knew there were going to be huge changes. You would have expected large changes but not changes for this position. Dan Ashworth was headhunted for many, many months.",
      "\"He was chased for 10 months, on gardening leave for four or five months, he was paid millions of pounds for. I worked with Dan Ashworth at the FA for two years and he's been very successful wherever he's been - Brighton, West Brom, the FA, at Newcastle.”"

At 31, the central defender now finds himself at a crossroads - clubless and without a competitive game in over a year since Rotherham United released him at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Once hailed as a future Red Devils defensive cornerstone, Blackett forged a solid Championship career after failing to make the grade at United. But his current limbo paints a stark contrast to the promise of his youth.",
      "\"How I've been? Okay,\" Blackett told Flashscore earlier this year. \"It's not been easy by any means, it's something which I've not had to deal with in my career before. Some days better than others.",
      "\"But I'm just getting through - staying fit and training. Just keeping on top of things and doing what I can do to be ready when the right opportunity comes. It's about waiting for the right fit now.\"",
      "Blackett’s journey began at eight when he joined United, his boyhood club, dreaming of emulating defensive titans Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. He rose swiftly through the academy, his blend of physicality and composure catching the eye.",
      "In 2014, with Ferdinand and Vidic both departing, a door cracked open. New manager Louis van Gaal, impressed by Blackett’s pre-season showings, fast-tracked him to the senior squad.",

      "Blackett made 12 senior appearances in Van Gaal’s first season, showing flashes of his potential. In 2015, when he signed a new contract, Van Gaal doubled down on his belief.",
      "“Tyler has great potential and I believe he is at the right club to continue his development and progression to become a great defender,” the Dutchman said. The words carried weight, fuelling optimism that Blackett could be United’s next homegrown star.",
      "A loan move to Celtic was sorted the following season, with hopes Blackett could get some high-level, regular football under his belt, before coming back to fight for a place in United's starting XI. Instead, the move backfired.",
      "Blackett languished on the bench or was used out of position at left-back, sapping his confidence and rhythm. He returned to Manchester a shadow of the player who’d left.",
      "The arrival of Jose Mourinho in 2016 sealed Blackett's fate. Unlike Van Gaal, Mourinho showed little faith in the young defender, allowing him to join Reading without a single sniff of first-team action. Blackett’s United dream was over.",
      "It was in Berkshire, as well as during later stints at Nottingham Forest and in the MLS with FC Cincinnati, that he showed glimpses of his old promise, albeit largely struggling for consistency once again.",
      "In 2023, Blackett signed with Rotherham. He made 23 appearances in the 2023/24 season, offering stability to a side battling relegation. But the Millers' struggles culminated in a drop to League One, and Blackett was released, leaving him without a club for the first time in his professional career.",
      "His time in Yorkshire, while steady, underscored a career that never quite recaptured the heights of his United days. Under Van Gaal, he stood on the cusp of greatness - a homegrown talent with the tools to succeed at the highest level. But football is unforgiving.",
      "Loans that falter, managerial changes, and fleeting confidence can derail even the brightest prospects. Blackett’s 12 appearances for United remain a fleeting highlight in a career that, while respectable, never matched the lofty expectations set in 2014. As he trains alone, awaiting the “right fit,” Blackett’s story serves as a poignant reminder of how fine the margins are in the beautiful game."

A top six finish would be good enough for European football, but it would also represent one of the rarest revivals in Premier League history.",
      "United finished eighth last season but have surpassed that this term for all the wrong reasons. Ruben Amorim, whose future beyond this season remains up for debate, claimed that he was presiding over \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history\" only months ago.",
      "The Red Devils sit a point behind West Ham in 15th, but are in the midst of a run that has seen them draw two and lose five of their last seven games. Tottenham could yet leapfrog the Manchester outfit, painting an even more bleak picture of the season.",
      "Recoveries following a strong summer transfer window and a positive pre-season are not unheard of. But to rise 10 places, which is what the Manchester bosses are eyeing, is something that is achieved once in a blue moon.",
      "In fact, in a 20-team Premier League, only FIVE times has a team jumped up 10 places or more the following season. One of those was the miracle of Leicester City - going from 14th after staving off relegation to become champions in a 5000/1 success. The type of story that truly is once in a lifetime.",

      "A year earlier and Aston Villa were celebrating finishing sixth after meandering down in 16th the previous season. That owed to a managerial change with David O'Leary coming in to replace Graham Taylor. That was an example of a new manager bounce really lifting a club as they landed UEFA Cup - now Europa League - qualification.",
      "Fulham were another side to benefit from a proper transfer window and a pre-season under Roy Hodgson in 2008. The veteran manager had narrowly dodged relegation to finish 17th, but in his first full season took the Cottagers all the way to the lofty heights of seventh - which allowed them to embark on their journey to the Europa League final the following campaign.",

Much like the aforementioned Fulham situation, the Hammers had change the manager the year prior, bringing in Moyes. As like Hodgson, Moyes was able to turnaround the club's fortunes after a proper pre-season and the chance to bring in his own players.",

      "But whilst they showed signs of promise, fending off the threat of relegation, Amorim has only served to take the Manchester outfit in the wrong direction. In the case of Leicester and Aston Villa, they changed managers in the summer and had an instant return.",
      "United's power brokers genuinely believe a top six finish is an acceptable aim for next season, but Premier League history suggests its a tall order and the direction of travel under Amorim would make finishing sixth once of the great recoveries.",
      "Worth noting also that, whilst United have never been this low in the Premier League, their biggest ever jump is from seventh to fourth. When you look at the club's entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved."

      "It's only a matter of time before Xabi Alonso is confirmed as the next Real Madrid manager after announcing he would be leaving Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The Spaniard will have huge plans about who will be in his team at the Bernabeu as he looks to help them bounce back from a barren season.",
      "Alonso is one of the most highly-rated young managers in football and stands to inherit a star-studded team featuring stars like Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr, but he will have idea of which areas he wants to strengthen too.",
      "Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has already been confirmed as the next Brazil boss and is should be only a matter of time before Alonso gets to work at his former club. He should only need a handful of signings to get his new side back in fighting condition for trophies again and it won't be long before he starts identifying those targets.",
      "Thibaut Courtois is the undisputed No 1 in goal and that won't change under Alonso, but he might need to start thinking about how his defence might look. Madrid have some ageing centre-backs, with Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba both aged 32, but they still have enough quality to star next season.",
      "Eder Militao will also hope to get in the team under Alonso but Los Blancos' new boss will want at least one new centre-back who can compete for a place and add much-needed competition.",
      "Jonathan Tah was a favourite of Alonso's at Leverkusen and he fancies taking the centre-half to Madrid with him, according to Spanish outlet AS. The commanding 29-year-old is in demand, though, and has also been linked with Manchester United.",
      "The German is available on a free transfer and would be a huge coup. But with Bayern Munich also sniffing around, a deal may not be as straightforward as it seems.",
      "While Trent Alexander-Arnold will consider himself as a defender, he is expected to operate between defence and midfield in Alonso's back three and play more as an attacking wing-back that will get forward and cause problems down the flanks.",
      "The England international's move is yet to be confirmed but is a formality after confirmation he will leave Liverpool this summer on a free transfer. It's believe Madrid are hoping to get Alexander-Arnold over the line before they depart for the Club World Cup.",
      "On the opposite flank, Alonso is said to want another left wing-back, especially after Ferland Mendy was ruled out with a serious muscle injury and is unlikely to be back before said tournament starts next month.",
      "Alonso could, then, launch another raid on Leverkusen for Alex Grimaldo, who has been superb across the last two seasons. He registered seven assists in the Bundesliga this season and had 13 last season, in addition to 10 goals.",
      "In the middle of the park, Federico Valverde is likely to be the automatic starter, but with Luka Modric approaching the end of his contract, Alonso will want a younger midfielder he can depend on for years to come. Martin Zubimendi has been strongly linked with Arsenal, but is also on Alonso's wishlist and the player may prefer to stay in Spain at one of the country's top clubs rather than join the Premier League.",
      "Find a way to accommodate both Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe will be a complex problem for any manager in football to solve but Madrid's attack practically picks itself. Alonso might find himself shoehorned into playing both Vinicius and Mbappe up front, with Bellingham playing just off them in the No 10 role, unless he opts to play the former two as wingers and buy a new forward.",
      "It will should become a real dilemma as superstar Mbappe will want to be the focal point up front, but Alonso may soon come to realise why Ancelotti had so many issues getting his squad to gel as a unit this season - and perhaps he'll see that the balance is wrong with Mbappe as the lone striker."

He has cancelled the Christmas party, reduced ticket allocations and benefits for the FA Cup final and made hundreds of staff redundant.",

      "Manchester United intend to retain Ruben Amorim this summer - even if they lose the Europa League final. The Portuguese coach has presided over a horrendous Premier League campaign which has led to questions over his future.",
      "The team have performed well below par and will register their worst top flight finish for decades, but have been able to up their game on the European stage. They've seen off the likes of Lyon and Athletic Bilbao and will now play in the final against Tottenham next week.",
      "Victory offers a route into the Champions League, but even a defeat won't change the stance of the United hierarchy. They believe that Amorim cannot properly be judged until he's had a transfer window to bring in players who suit his unique system, reports The Guardian.",
      "Amorim has stuck defiantly to his philosophy since arriving in Manchester to replace Erik ten Hag in November. He's managed just six Premier League wins in that time, which has seen the team fall to 16th. After their loss against West Ham on Sunday the head coach appeared to question his own credentials.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\". Amorim has also questioned whether the Red Devils should compete in the Champions League.",
      "The United hierarchy, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have owned up to their error after retaining Ten Hag last summer despite months of poor results. The Dutchman was handed a new deal, backed in the summer, but then sacked shortly after.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system bought huge success in Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles, but it hasn't led to an upturn in results in Manchester. The club have had to endure several embarrassing home defeats with a number of players continuing to underwhelm.",
      "With the exception of Bruno Fernandes nearly the entire United squad is struggling to match expectations. As a result nearly the entire squad is up for sale with the Manchester outfit prepared to listen to a number of offers. More worryingly is the return to form of Marcus Rashford and Antony - two men who were struggling only to rediscover top form out on loan.",
      "Amorim will certainly need to bolster his resources out wide in the summer, bringing in individuals capable of playing as wing-backs. More firepower is also a priority with United's frontmen struggling for goals, which has led to links with the likes of Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap."

      "Manchester United's season continues to sway from one low to another and now Ruben Amorim is questioning whether he's the right man for the job. The Red Devils slipped to 16th with their loss to West Ham on Sunday.",
      "A worst ever Premier League finish was confirmed several weeks ago but the team appear determined to sink even further. Their record at Old Trafford makes for grim reading and Amorim looks to be out of answers.",
      "He claimed that he shoulders the responsibility and maybe he wasn't the man to take United forward following their latest defeat. He's since admitted he's embarrassed by the state of affairs as the 40-year-old, who was highly-rated before coming to England, struggles to turn around the club's fortunes.",
      "The Europa League has provided some hope and United can claim a trophy in Bilbao next week should they beat Tottenham. That would come with Champions League revenue, but those in the club have admitted that it won't salvage what has been a poor season.",
      "It certainly leaves Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy with a decision to make. They made a clanger by retaining Erik ten Hag, handing him a new deal and then sacking him within six months so they will be loathed to get another managerial call wrong.",
      "But the warning signs are very clear! Amorim is clearly a very good coach and came with a huge reputation. And Manchester United has a habit of ruining reputations! It can eat good managers up - and spit them out.",
      "Two big things worry me. His tactical inflexibility. That is ridiculous. He’s so wedded to a back three that he’d rather play that and lose than actually be adaptable and go to a system that suits his current players. It’s a huge weakness on his make up. Players make systems, not the other way round.",
      "His constant negativity. He makes good headlines and I’m not about to tell him to stop! But Sunday’s message that he’d quit if results don’t improve next year, didn’t even feel remotely fresh. He says something similar every week. That hardly lifts the players. Maybe he’s trying to lower expectations but I’m not sure it works.",
      "They must stick with him into next season. United would love that to be with Champions League qualification which would be a game changer. But even if they lose the Europa final, they can’t ditch him so quickly.",
      "Of all Amorim’s mistakes this season, the biggest one was taking the job when he did. Talk about a poisoned chalice. And while he has to take a good portion of responsibility for Manchester United’s embarrassing domestic form, he inherited a squad that is barely fit for Premier League purposes.",
      "That he has got the same squad to the final of the Europa League - going unbeaten in that competition - is a minor miracle and should make him immune from dismissal this summer. Amorim needs a pre-season to get at least some of the players he wants - easier said than done - and he needs a pre-season to get the current players fit.",
      "Of all the big issues he faces, the deficiencies in fitness and physicality of this United squad is right up there amongst them - and Amorim will crack the whip ahead of next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is clearly not averse to sacking people but Amorim should not be on his list.",
      "Amorim did not want to take the Manchester United job mid-season in November - and his judgement has been proved right. HIs first domestic campaign has been horrendous with so many of the squad he inherited simply not suitable for his playing style",
      "But the Portuguese, 40, was the best young coach in Europe last year and six months at Old Trafford does not make him the worst. He has clearly been shocked by the poor standards at Manchester United and some of his statements have been shockingly honest - but also true. Amorin will be sacked if Premier League results continue.",
      "But winning the Europa League and using the Champions League money to invest in new players - and a full pre-season to drill his squad - will see an immediate improvement next term. Otherwise it is back to square one again. But the recent history at Old Trafford suggests they will spare their manager this summer - and then sack him in the autumn anyway.",
      "The remit of any incoming manager - particularly mid-season - is to improve the fortunes of their side. Has Amorim done that? Not really.",
      "If anything, the Red Devils’ dismal season has gotten even worse over recent weeks. There’s been no real sign of development at Old Trafford over the six months that Amorim has been at the helm and that should be a real worry for club chiefs.",
      "But there is of course one saving grace. United could waltz out of Bilbao this month with a trophy under their arm and a ticket back into the Champions League. And that will go a long way to helping Amorim bring in the players that he wants this summer, which MAY change the entire trajectory of the Portuguese’s stint at the club.",
      "There’s also no point sacking him and putting United back at square one. Given the money spent, it would be a misstep to invest even more in sacking Amorim and finding his potential replacement.",
      "He should be given a stay of execution for now. But should things fail to improve heading into next season then this debate should definitely re-emerge.",
      "Sacking another manager will solve United's problems like installing traffic lights on the M60 will cure traffic jams.",
      "Amorim had misgivings about joining the club mid-season because he needed time to bed in his 3-4-3 shape and that's not easy when you are losing at home to West Ham, Wolves, Newcastle, Brighton and Palace with no time to implement your philosophy on the training ground.",
      "Winning the Europa League would paper over a lot of cracks, but it would also bring in upwards of £50million in revenue - and since money is the language Sir Jim and the Old Trafford cabal understand most, they are better off sticking with Amorim if he delivers a trophy.",
      "The United manager's raw honesty has not helped his own cause, but at least he speaks the truth: This is the worst team in the club's history and they are embarrassing.",
      "Give him key signings down the spine of the team - Jarrad Branthwaite and Viktor Gyokeres for starters - and the line on the graph should turn upwards sharply. But if Amorim leaves, and United spin the merry-go-round again, who's going to install the winning culture that's been missing since Fergie retired?",
      "As much as I have reservations about philosophy having priority over getting the best out of a squad of players, it would only add to Manchester United's chaos if they parted ways with Amorim. The season has been a disaster and was heading that way without his influence.",
      "The Portuguese coach has been employed for his style and pedigree and was even persuaded to come in early, rather than with a full pre-season to work in. It has been far from ideal.",
      "The 40-year-old has a lot to prove but should only be judged by the after an extensive pre-season and some activity in the transfer market which actually shapes the team into the framework he wants. All of that is not to say Amorim has earned any credit, though European outings perhaps offer some hope. United could easily find themselves in the same situation as earlier this season.",
      "It isn't time to twist yet, but ultimately these kind of results can only carry on for so longer. Whilst I believe Amorim is a good manager this currently doesn't seem like a good fit.",
      "The red side of Manchester has been a graveyard for managers and players and I think plenty around Europe would still hold Amorim in a positive light, largely because of what he did at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "His loyalty to his philosophy has veered into naivety at times, he could've gone more conventional, but clearly he's prepared to die on the hill he sits on. There's no getting away from the fact these United players aren't good enough to do what he wants to do.",
      "But looking at it from an ownership perspective, Ratcliffe and co have already got rid of Ten Hag and their eye for a manager is clearly in question. Equally, if Amorim was given the boot, why would any potential manager put their hat into the ring knowing you might not even get a summer with your players.",
      "If Manchester United are prepared to sack Ruben Amorim after six months and a cup final then it was a waste of time to appoint him in the first place. It was no secret that his style and the club’s personnel didn’t exactly sync up, and there was never going to be a quick fix.",
      "Even if United lose to Spurs in Bilbao, Amorim deserves a summer window to work on building the squad he wants. They were prepared to back Erik ten Hag last summer when the cracks were already visible, so this is the least they can do for his successor.",
      "None of us can know why the league form has been so far from what United have shown in Europe, but at least in the latter there have been signs this group of players wants to fight for the boss. There’s no point ripping it all up to start again."

      "Ashworth, 54, garnered an impressive reputation within the game during his previous tenure with the FA before leaving in 2018. He has subsequently held roles in the Premier League at Brighton - where he once again earned plenty of plaudits for his work - and Newcastle before being pursued by United.",
      "He was eventually given the green light to proceed with a move to Old Trafford in July 2024 but lasted just five months in the role, with United paying £4.1million in total to both acquire and part ways with the Magpies' former sporting director.",

      "Overseeing a refurbishment of the national training facility, dubbed 'St Georges Park 2.0' will be among the primary projects to be overseen by Ashworth, whose standing within the game has not been affected by his surprisingly brief tenure at Manchester United. The Red Devils are said to have 'agreed to release Ashworth to work' under the terms of his severance package.",
      "United have not sought an out-an-out replacement for Ashworth since his departure with chief executive, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, the club's technical director, instead taking on more responsibility.",
      "A statement confirming Ashworth's departure at the time read: “Dan Ashworth will be leaving his role as Sporting Director of Manchester United by mutual agreement.

      "There were roles for young defenders Jaydan Kamason, James Overy, Godwill Kukonki, Tyler Fredricson, Sam Murray, Daniel Armer and Harry Amass. Fredricson and Amass are regulars in the first-team group now but amid a defensive injury crisis some of the others might fancy their chances of being involved at Stamford Bridge.",

      "He has conceded 18 goals in nine starts in all competitions this season and hasn't proven himself as a reliable back-up goalkeeper. The Turkish international was calamitous against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in December. He had a night to forget and made mistakes, conceding four goals in London.",
      "Amorim bravely handed another chance to Bayindir against Arsenal in the FA Cup. Bayindir had already been responsible for United crashing out of a cup competition, so Amorim rolled the dice with his team selection, but at least he was able to deliver on the other side of North London.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Ruben Amorim has talked with the Man United board ahead of a huge transfer window.",

      "Semenyo does not have a release clause but Bournemouth value him at £50million - a fee that would represent a huge deal of profit for the south coast club.",
      "Dan Ashworth is set to take a new job with the Football Association, according to the BBC.",
      "Ashworth made a shock departure from his position as Manchester United's sporting director in December, and he is set to take up his first role since his short tenure at Old Trafford.",

      "\"We need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave. Because we cannot have a season like this next year. If the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.\"",
      "And beIN Sports broadcaster Keys believes such a stance vindicates his belief that Amorim is trying to get the sack.",
      "\"How long have I been saying Ruben Amorim has been trying to get the sack? You all laughed at me,\" Keys wrote in his latest blog.",
      "\"Well, now what? Because this weekend, he all but resigned. It's hard to interpret his post-match comments after the West Ham defeat any other way.\"",
      "Manchester United are close to a verbal agreement and personal terms with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, according to Goal Brasil's Valentin Furlan.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been linked with a move for Cunha after impressing at Wolves this season. He has scored 15 goals and added six assists in 31 Premier League matches.",

      "Costa has told The National: \"So Antony lacked a little patience. He also went through a lot of messed up things. I know about family issues.",
      "\"So the kid's head was very messed up because he's very talented. Antony is very good, and look, now that he's happy, he's calm, he's having an impressive season. It's very easy to criticise from the outside, but as players, our heads count for a lot. If we're not clean, it ends up affecting the field.",
      "\"He had a very difficult problem behind him because of the accusation against him but now he's fine. He's calm. He's happy and confident. Look how he's doing at Betis. If he carries on like this he's a player who’s going to be there to play in the World Cup.\"",
      "Manchester United are expected to keep Ruben Amorim as head coach next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham, according to The Guardian.",
      "Amorim has endured a mixed time at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting CP and replacing Erik ten Hag in November. The Portuguese has won just six and drawn six of his 25 Premier League matches in charge - a run that has seen them drop down to 16th in the table.",
      "However, it's not been all doom and gloom for United since Amorim has arrived. In the Europa League, United have been excellent, and have won nine and drawn five of their 14 fixtures in that competition.",
      "There has been talk that, considering their dire Premier League form, Amorim could face the sack if United lose the Europa League final against Spurs and are denied Champions League football next season.",
      "However, that is NOT the case, as it's reported that Amorim will keep his job regardless of the result against Ange Postecoglou's side in Bilbao.",
      "The United board feel that Amorim deserves the summer transfer window to improve his squad and sign players more suited to his system.",
      "Manchester United could receive a boost in their potential pursuit of Victor Osimhen this summer, as Napoli have reportedly made a move for his replacement.",
      "Osimhen, who spent this season on loan at Galatasaray following a public falling out with Napoli manager Antonio Conte, is among the players set to depart the club at the end of the season. He has been linked with a move to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his attacking options.",
      "Napoli, meanwhile, have already identified Osimhen's replacement - Lille’s Jonathan David, who is set to leave the French club on a free transfer when his contract expires.",
      "Fabrizio Romano states that the Italian giants have submitted a proposal to the striker and advanced talks are currently ongoing. He also adds that 'key' details are yet to be clarified before David makes a decision on his future.",
      "Man United legend Rio Ferdinand has opened up on his 'crazy' recent health scare that forced him to sit out of his TNT Sport punditry duties.",
      "Speaking out for the first time, Ferdinand offered an update and a scary behind the scenes of the ordeal that left him hospitalised. \"My wife, the women in my family, will never know… man flu. That’s what it’s really about, man flu,\" he said, speaking on the Rio Ferdinand presents YouTube channel.",
      "\"I had a mad virus, bro. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously. I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn’t even open my eyes.",
      "\"Then, the headache I had… I don’t get migraines or nothing else so I don’t know what they’re like. I thought my head was in a vice and my eyes were going to pop out. Then, I was being sick, projectile vomiting in the toilet, I got back to bed and I was having vertigo.",
      "\"I was holding onto the sheets, I didn’t know where I was. It was crazy. I had to go to hospital and the doctor even said to me, 'Do you want an ambulance', so that’s when I knew.",
      "\"He went, ‘We’re going to get your brain scanned. I thought it was a virus or a flu or something so when he mentioned brain scan and the ambulance, the panic was nuts.",
      "\"I went to hospital and I was in there for a few days. I couldn’t even enjoy the hospital food. The soup and the ice cream normally does wonders.\"",
      "Gary Pallister believes the current Man United squad has not done Ruben Amorim any favours as he tries to turn the club's misfortunes around.",
      "\"I think we have to wait to see what kind of stamp he put on it,\" Pallister told Betway. \"I think it’s very difficult to judge him this year with the team he’s got.",
      "\"He's tried to change it to his own style and his own tactics, and as of now, that’s not worked. He needs to bring in players that will be more comfortable in the system, and bring more character into the side.",
      "\"So, I think we’ve got to give him the amount of time that he deserves, and I think any manager would deserve, but he's only going to get a certain time now and in the next season before people do start judging him.\"",
      "The Daily Mail claim the Brazilian midfielder will receive a pay rise if Man United win the Europa League this month.",
      "It's reported that his wages will increase by 25 percent if United qualify for the Champions League next season. This would bring his weekly earnings close to £500,000, reportedly the same amount Cristiano Ronaldo earned during his second stint at the club."

      "Ryan Giggs has suggested Ruben Amorim demanded attention from the club's board when he said his Manchester United are \"maybe\" the worst side in the club's history.",
      "United have endured an abysmal Premier League season and winning the Europa League against Tottenham Hotspur at the Estadio de San Mamés is the only way to salvage 2024/2025.",
      "Amorim has spoken honestly about his players since his appointment in November and he made headlines in January when he said his team are \"maybe\" the worst in the club's history.",
      "United are guaranteed to record their lowest-ever points total in the Premier League this season. They suffered a 17th defeat of the campaign to West Ham last weekend and will face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge before they prepare to take on Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Giggs recently spoke to Webby & O’Neill and he discussed Amorim's controversial comment.",
      "\"I think first of all, he's sort of dampening expectations and maybe talking to the powers above to say I need backing and this team needs improving,\" explained Giggs. \"I don't think anyone can say this United are the worst, me or you, because we've not seen every United team.",
      "\"I think we've fallen from the recent levels of history and success, fallen a long way. He's been truthful when he has come to the club, and he's probably not expected it to be so bad.",
      "\"So he's been very open and some people have found it refreshing, some people have had different views, but yeah. It was a surprising quote, but I think it was speaking to the powers above.\"",
      "After his arrival from Sporting Lisbon, Amorim immediately implemented a different system. The formation heavily relies on wing-backs and doesn't accommodate traditional wingers.",
      "Giggs said: \"I'm biased, I'm a winger and a massive part of this club's history is wingers. This system that Ruben is determined to keep doesn't really cater to that. You can obviously play a winger in one of the wing-back positions and maybe a more defensive-minded person on the opposite flank.",
      "\"You're not going to see loads of wingers in this system, but I think where we are now, the club have brought in a coach who has a certain philosophy, a certain system and his own principles.",
      "\"Now you have to back him and give him the players that he needs in that system. They are specialised positions and whether we can get those players is another story.\"",
      "About the Europa League final, Giggs added: \"In the last few years, we have shown we can win cups, and we have become a sort of cup final team, so it was never out of the picture.",
      "\"And when you marry it with our Premier League form, then probably not [expect to make the final in Bilbao], but our form in Europe has been good, and it's just a massive contrast.\""

      "Sancho is a player who is said to be close to Hudson-Odoi but the former Borussia Dortmund winger has had a difficult spell at Old Trafford.",
      "The 25-year-old currently plies his trade at United's Premier League rivals Chelsea on loan and has an obligation in his contract that will see him complete a permanent move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "He previously spoke glowingly about Hudson-Odoi, lavishing praise on his fellow forward's key attacking attributes and tipping him for future stardom.",
      "\"Me and Callum are close friends,\" said Sancho in 2019. \"We've played with each other at England",
      "\"He's the next one I would say. He's very good, very talented, fast and good dribbling skills.",
      "\"I have told him the Bundesliga is a nice league. I just told him to do whatever is best for him and whatever makes him feel comfortable.\"",

      "With there being no plans for the gala, the report adds that those awards and others are expected to be handed out on the pitch before their final Premier League match of the season with Villa.",
      "The decision also aligns with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s efforts to cut costs and redirect more revenue into strengthening the squad. Since Ratcliffe and INEOS assumed control in Manchester, the club has already undergone two rounds of redundancies.",
      "United still have a chance to secure European silverware this season, with a Europa League final against Tottenham set for May 21 in Bilbao.",

A trophy to wash away at least some of the shame of a season of total embarrassment on the domestic front, an unlikely spot in the Champions League and a £100million+ boost to the summer transfer budget.",
      "For Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim, maybe there is some personal salvation too, the chance to turn a narrative around, but their situations look set. Postecoglou is very likely to leave Spurs, win or lose, and Amorim will stay at United, win or lose. The Aussie could walk away with a trophy and enhance his job prospects elsewhere, and the Portuguese could buy himself time at Old Trafford, but this final is bigger for the clubs rather than the managers.",
      "It looks like this will be a battle between the 16th and 17th best teams in the Premier League. The big six superpowers are somehow only propped up by the three teams getting relegated this season. Whatever happens in Bilbao, the stain of such a dismal 38-game campaign won't be removed completely.",
      "But it's about next season as well, and although Amorim is desperate for the trophy, he sounds uncertain about the rewards that will follow, not in terms of the silverware, but a spot in the Champions League for a team that he has declared aren't ready for such challenges.",
      "Take this snippet from his post-match press conference on Sunday after losing to West Ham: \"I don’t know what is best, if it’s playing Champions League or not.\"",
      "Or this from his pre-match press conference ahead of the Europa League quarter-final second leg against Lyon: \"If you look at this moment, I think we are not ready to be really competitive in the Premier League and to cope with the Champions League. I think it’s really clear and we have to be really clear.\"",
      "It was in that press conference before the rollercoaster ride against the Ligue 1 side that Amorim first considered the possibility that being in the Champions League might not be the be-all and end-all it has been made out to be in the last couple of months.",
      "\"If you have Champions League, it’s going to be tough to play against top teams on Wednesday and then top teams in [the] Premier League,\" he said.",
      "\"We are in the moment that you can feel it that the team needs a lot of work. A lot of work means a lot of time to train. So, you can see it both ways. If you don’t have Champions League – and we want Champions League, we want to win the title, it’s the most important thing, it’s the best thing – but if you don’t have Champions League, you can think that we can have full weeks to rebuild and have more time to work. So that is important when are going to make the plan for the next season, it’s really important, it will change everything.\"",
      "The obvious advantages to being in the Champions League are the financial rewards it offers and the fact that top players want to be in that competition. That will be massive to United at a time when they have skirted close to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability regulations (PSR).",
      "But for a coach, free midweeks offer more time on the training ground. Amorim is desperate for extra sessions at Carrington to develop his ideas, and he will need time next season to drill what could be a new-look squad.",
      "You only have to look at Chelsea in 2016/17 to see the advantages of not playing European competition. They missed out after a dismal season the year before, but with Antonio Conte in charge and their schedule clear, they had time to work on his 3-5-2 system and stormed to the title.",
      "Nobody is suggesting that will happen to United, but it shows the advantages of having extra time on the training ground, and that sounds like something Amorim is valuing at the moment.",
      "That's not to say he will go into next week's final hoping United lose. He will be desperate to win. But if the worst does happen, he has already explained why it doesn't have to be the disaster many will consider it to be."

      "\"We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave,\" Ruben Amorim stressed. It would take a brave man not to gut this maligned Manchester United squad.",
      "United's 16th position in the Premier League and 17 defeats are unforgivable, regardless of their Europa League progress. The truest gauge of a team is their league form and United's has not been this appalling since people wore flares and listened to Slade.",
      "Amorim merits backing but, irrespective of whether United return from Bilbao with a new attraction for the club museum, the scrutiny on his position will be intense before each of those first three autumnal international breaks in the first third of next season.",
      "He admitted on Sunday that if the complacent culture continues to linger next season he should be sacked. Amorim has the matchgoers onside, so much so his name is chanted more regularly than any of the players.",
      "United supporters are often dignified in expressing their disapproval. It took a 4-1 humbling by Watford for them to specifically boo Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Vicarage Road. In front of the Sir Elton John Stand, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Separating the head coach from the players signals a vote of confidence for Amorim and a vote of no confidence for the majority of players. Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro are in the good books. All four have been serenaded recently. Amad is a firm fan favourite.",
      "Amad and Fernandes renewed their contracts in the last year, Maguire had his extended until 2026 and Yoro only arrived in July. Casemiro's Europa League pedigree has endeared him to supporters who appreciate his commitment and gutsiness after 18 months in decline.",
      "The purported poster boys of the new United, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, have had trying campaigns and the bond between academy starlets and supporters is not as ardent as it was a year ago. A rejected bid for Garnacho and a rejected contract by Mainoo have doubtless contributed. Both players' agents were sat among the United squad's family and friends in San Mames two weeks ago.",
      "As for the rest, fans would not kick up a fuss if the majority left. United acquired a dependable squad player in Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven showed promise before injury and Lisandro Martinez is an undeniable asset when fit.",
      "Then there are the frozen assets - those who freeze in the United shirt. Serie A remains a dumping ground for English clubs and United have to write off at least one of the £108.5million misfits Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Hojlund has eked three goals in 32 games and this is his second season. Zirkzee creditably rallied after his ignominious first-half substitution against Newcastle United but United are not going to get to where they aspire to be with him in the team. The two forwards bought from Europe's boot should be given the boot.",
      "Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola was underpinned by them clearing the decks at full back in the summer of 2017. Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy were released while Aleksandar Kolarov was sold. City invested £126.5m to recruit Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo.",
      "By City's sixth game of the 2017-18 season, Walker and Mendy had tallied more assists than Sagna, Zabaleta, Kolarov and Clichy had done between them in the previous campaign. Although Mendy succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury in City's eighth fixture, the die had been cast. Fabian Delph came in as an auxiliary left back and the front-footed approach had a profound effect on serial matchwinning wingers Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane.",
      "Walker is a City great. Mendy is not held in remotely similar esteem for obvious reasons and without him Guardiola reinvented the wheel at left back. Delph and then Oleksandr Zinchenko had successful stints out of position there. City have still not signed a recognisable left back since Mendy.",
      "United, meanwhile, still have a left back who joined 11 years ago. They are saddled with Luke Shaw, approaching the last two years of his contract. Victor Lindelof's outstayed welcome will end after eight years and the United hierarchy must have breathed a sigh of relief when they discovered that there was not a one-year option on Christian Eriksen's contract.",
      "Loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have to be shifted permanently. United may have a similar waiting game with Rashford to last summer's with Sancho, who joined Chelsea at the 11th hour. Europa Conference League finalist Antony is at least creating a market that should ensure his fee prevents United from making a loss on him under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Casemiro's European form cannot hoodwink United. If they lose to Tottenham in Bilbao, no European football next season would effectively render Casemiro more redundant than some of the staff the club are letting go. The 33-year-old's revival has been restricted to the Europa League.",
      "Should Casemiro stay or go, Amorim would be sanguine. His perception of the Brazilian has altered drastically since the end of the winter transfer window. As instrumental as Casemiro was against Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao, hardly any clubs would stump up the £15m United require and match Casemiro's handsome £300,000-a-week salary.",
      "Unlike Manuel Ugarte against Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro is brave, at least."

      "His versatility to play as a centre-forward and attacking midfielder makes him a top target for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Following difficulty in front of goal this season - United have failed to score more than one goal in 29 games this season - a new-look attack isn't an impossible thought for the start of next season.",
      "Arsenal are also thought to be watching Cunha's situation closely with reports last week claiming the Gunners' new sporting director Andrea Berta had held talks with his representatives. However, United's pull in the transfer market looks to hit the jackpot again with it said an agreement is close to bring the 25-year-old to Old Trafford.",
      "Goal Brasil's Valentin Furlan has reported that a deal for United to land one of their priority deals is close with them 'expected to hit' the former Atletico Madrid's £62.5million release clause at Molineux plus a potential further £5m in add-ons.",
      "Cunha would join up with national team teammate Casemiro at Old Trafford but more smart transfer business by Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox could supplement Cunha's switch.",
      "Much of Wolves' success in the past two seasons have come down to Cunha, Pedro Neto - who joined Chelsea last summer - and Rayan Ait-Nouri. Attacking wing-back Ait-Nouri has enjoyed a terrific individual season to emerge as one of the most in-demand left-backs in European football.",
      "The 23-year-old, who plays in a very similar role to Patrick Dorgu in Vitor Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system, has scored five goals and assisted another seven this season. Liverpool and Tottenham have both previously been linked with a move for the Algeria international and he was on United's radar previously.",
      "Ait-Nouri ranks in the top 84th percentile for total shots compared to positional peers in Europe’s top five divisions. He also ranks in the top 87th for assists, 85th for non-penalty expected goals plus assisted goals, 84th for progressive carries, 97th for successful take-ons and 91st for touches in the attacking penalty area (all stats provided by FBREF).",
      "However, Wolves are reportedly preparing to offer their star man a new contract in an attempt to keep him at the club. But as United are fully aware of, Cunha signed a new contract at the start of the year and is primed to leave anyway.",
      "Noticeably, Ait-Nouri sanctioned a key switch in a footballer's career that occasionally hints at a potential big transfer. Earlier this week, it was reported that he had signed with the CAA Stellar agency, who represent Morgan Gibbs-White, Eduardo Camavinga and Ibrahima Konate.",
      "French publication Fennec News have reported the switch has happened in order to facilitate a move this summer, which remains to be seen.",
      "The left wing-back position is unlikely to be a priority for United following Dorgu's January signing and the emergence of Harry Amass. However, there aren't many players who fit United's system better than Ait-Nouri and at 23, he fits the exact profile the recruitment team are searching for at Old Trafford."

      "Man Utd’s hopes of landing one of their summer transfer targets on a free transfer have taken a serious hit after Fabrizio Romano revealed Bayern Munich are now in pole position.",
      "Utd had grown “increasingly confident” of securing Tah in recent weeks, amid mounting uncertainty over their defensive options.",
      "With Victor Lindelof expected to leave this summer, and ongoing concerns over Matthijs de Ligt’s fitness amid a number of other injuries, defensive reinforcements are a top priority for INEOS this summer.",
      "Defence isn’t the only priority, as the Red Devils are looking to move early in the market to secure their top targets, including Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Tah, 29, is viewed as one of the most experienced and dependable defenders on the market. And with his contract up at the end of the season, he had emerged as a serious candidate for a reshaped Man Utd backline under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Bayern Munich have now made their move.",
      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",
      "Barcelona were also linked earlier this year but are now out of the race. Romano confirmed the Catalan side have no intention of moving for the Germany international, citing their wealth of centre-back options as the reason. “Not because of FFP,” he added, “but because they have many centre-backs.”",
      "Real Madrid, Tah’s current boss Xabi Alonso’s new home, are reportedly focused on other targets. And that leaves Bayern, once again, looking likely to poach a top performer from a direct Bundesliga rival.",
      "It’s a hammer blow to Utd, who were one of the first English clubs to seriously explore the free-agent opportunity and saw Tah as an ideal blend of experience, physicality and leadership.",
      "His 400+ appearances for Leverkusen, capped off by a historic unbeaten title-winning season last term, had put him firmly on the radar of INEOS chiefs.",
      "Tah himself confirmed earlier this year that his decision to leave Leverkusen had already been made.",
      "“Definitely,” he said when asked if he would leave at season’s end.",
      "“I made the decision not to renew my contract and to stick with it. That’s the case now. The club knows about it. Everything has been said from the beginning.”",
      "But there remains a flicker of hope for Utd. If Amorim’s side can secure Champions League football by lifting the Europa League, they could re-enter the frame with a more attractive sporting package.",
      "But for now, Bayern are firmly in control.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Bayer Leverkusen Jonathan Tah on a free transfer as their third summer signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘reached out’ to Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah as they ‘sense an opportunity’.",
      "Man Utd are weighing up whether to attempt to beat Barcelona and other clubs to the free transfer of Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, according to reports.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah reportedly has ‘one and a half feet’ in Old Trafford and could sign for Manchester United after Barcelona’s late U-turn."

      "Six appeal\nWe’ve all enjoyed the idea of Manchester United having the target of a top-six finish next season, with the Mirror quick to point out that teams leaping 10 places in the table from one season to the next is an unusual event managed only five times by anyone in 20-team Premier League seasons – or ‘FIVE times in history’ if you’re an overexcited Reach headline writer.",
      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",
      "So yes, a 10-place jump back into the top six next season seems unlikely and United probably won’t do it. But their own failure to achieve such a thing in over 60 years doesn’t really seem that damning.",

      "Just to tick these all off quickly: the TEN players is in fact ‘eight to 10’ by the time you get to the intro and only ‘five or six’ actually still under contract beyond this season by the time you get to Neville’s actual quote, the FOUR club stars are Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia so, well, yeah, probably right, and the Neville ‘sickly feeling’ reveal is… he thinks only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team. You just told us.",

      "Jurgen Klopp’s verdict on Xabi Alonso speaks volumes after Real Madrid snub",
      "Good to know volumes are being spoken at least, that’s always good. But the rest of it is a puzzle. What Real Madrid snub? Who’s snubbing who exactly?",
      "Infuriatingly, we have no choice but to read on to try and find out what’s occurring here.",
      "Jurgen Klopp has hailed Xabi Alonso as a ‘standout’ manager as he prepares to take over at Real Madrid. The Spaniard has already confirmed that he will be leaving current side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the summer.",
      "Right, okay, fine. But where’s the snub? He’s going to Real Madrid. That is, if anything, the opposite of a snub.",
      "Of course, we do here have the now-standard tabloid use of the word ‘as’ where instead of the usual dictionary meaning of ‘something that happens during the time when something else is taking place’ it in fact means ‘something that happens at literally any time other than the time when something else is taking place’.",
      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",
      "Yet still we get no nearer to this Real Madrid snub. Until, far later, when we eventually get this.",
      "Ironically, Klopp might have actually talked himself out of contention for the Real Madrid job, with the Spanish side eventually moving for Alonso. It had long been reported that the former Liverpool boss was among their favoured candidates for the role.",
      "So the snub is Real Madrid not giving the job to Jurgen Klopp, a man who expressed no interest in the job and who made it very clear when leaving Liverpool that he would not be returning to a frontline managerial job for some time and quite possibly ever? What a snub. What volumes spoken. What absolute bollocks.",

With the current coefficients, that would mean EPL Vs Serie A, La Liga Vs Bundesliga, Ligue 1 vs Eredivisie and so on. Then you could award loads of coefficient points for the competition so leagues that do well tend to play higher-ranked leagues the next season.",

Those competitions have too many games anyway, and this would attract more TV money, because interest would be broader.

In fact, it’s not just the top teams in the EPL, like City and Liverpool, but also those almost all the way down the EPL table.",
      "Currently, we are seeing almost every star player being linked with a move to the EPL.

      "United don’t have the same desperate, yearning hunger for a trophy – they win them all the time regardless of how sh*t they happen to be at any given moment. And they are still Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. They’ll still attract players, they’ll still have the chance to build what they want to build under Ruben Amorim, even if losing the final mires it in greater early uncertainty.",
      "Spurs are completely f*cked if they don’t win the final, and might be quite f*cked even if they do. Even if they do win it, they probably need to thank Ange Postecoglou profusely for delivering on his second-season-trophy promise in the most absurd manner imaginable and move on.",

      "Appointing Graham Potter when they did was both a shrewd move, one that reflected a reality in which the trajectories of both parties had pulled them into each other’s orbit at an opportune moment where it didn’t look like an embarrassing option for either, yet also one that conceded the current season was being written off.",
      "That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Julen Lopetegui idea had proved a bad one, and there was no point persisting with someone serving up Moyes-lite dullness with no obvious way out of the doldrums.",
      "Potter has not necessarily improved results or performances, but he does offer at least the prospect of better and above all more watchable things to come.",
      "When we think of Good Potter, of Brighton Potter, we think of a meticulous manager with carefully crafted and well-drilled plans. He is a manager who absolutely needs a pre-season. And if anything is left of that Potter, and we really think he’s still in there, then it is only when next season is firmly under way that we can even begin to assess where he and West Ham are at.",
      "The vital thing to do at the start of the season, though, is to avoid offering any encouragement at all to those promoted clubs looking for someone they might be able to drag into a fight. There are few contenders for that role, and West Ham shouldn’t really be one either, but circumstance places them as one of the few for whom a noticeably poor start would offer genuine succour to the newbies.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November\nWolves have a recent habit of allowing the sloppy end to one season to bleed into a difficult start to the next, often accompanied by rushed or half-baked managerial change.",
      "They lost four of their last six games in 2020/21, and then four of the first five in 2021/22. That season ended with a seven-match winless run, followed by one win in the first nine of 2022/23.",
      "The 2022/23 season then ended with four defeats in their last seven games, and one win in six started the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "That season ended with seven defeats in the last 10, mirrored by seven defeats (and no wins) in the first 10 games of this season.",
      "The fact Wolves have pretty comfortably remained a Premier League club throughout all that tells you that in the middle part they’re generally doing fine.",
      "But these stumbling finishes and slow starts feel like an unnecessary frustration.",
      "It did look like they might be about to buck the trend this time with a six-game winning run through March and April raising genuine hopes of approaching the summer with momentum and optimism.",
      "May, though, has brought a pair of defeats and with games against Palace and Brentford to come there is no guarantee Wolves do snap back out of it before the summer. And as with West Ham above, and Wolves’ own early struggles this season, it would appear a particularly bad time to be offering early hope to newcomers.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",

      "Arsenal and Andrea Berta are already on top of the most tempting release clauses in world football, with Liverpool eyeing up one with perhaps the best value.",
      "This is an inexhaustive list of players with release clauses which could actually viably be triggered from summer 2025 onwards. We are talking sub-£100m, not your daft £1bn La Liga jobs.",
      "",
      "Joan Garcia\nArsenal are leading ‘half of Europe’ in the race to sign a keeper they almost landed last summer. They will be hoping for smoother talks with Espanyol, and perhaps even for them to lose their La Liga relegation battle as a £20.9m release clause would drop to £12.5m.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015. He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen\nBournemouth spent £12.8m on a teenaged centre-half whose professional career comprised of 15 appearances for Juventus and Roma last July; within a season they are preparing for a £50m auction on their full Spain international.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong\nThe homegrown bonus of Manchester City academy product Frimpong is obvious but even without it his brilliance at wing-back for Bayer Leverkusen will convince many that £33.5m is something approaching a steal. Liverpool certainly seem to be of that mind.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nIt could depend on which European competition Aston Villa qualify for but they are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago. Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",
      "",
      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco. The centre-half has attracted interest from the Hammers, Crystal Palace, Sevilla and Wolfsburg in his £16.7m release clause.",
      "",
      "Jan Bednarek\nAny club desperate to sign a centre-half with two recent relegations on his CV can do so for the cheap old price of £6m.",
      "",
      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is still widely assumed that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nNot two months separated Cunha signing a four-and-a-half year contract extension with an improved release clause of £62.5m, and the Brazilian saying he has “made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things,” before claiming to have been misquoted. The reality is that 15 goals and four assists in 29 games for a relegation-battling side will sufficiently tempt someone.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain. The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\nAnother Arsenal target – to the chagrin of many supporters – but really any aspiring team in world football will have at least taken a look at Gyokeres before wincing ever so slightly at that £86m release clause. Sporting are among the best sellers across the globe and will back themselves to get the best possible deal.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus\nAfter this season especially, it feels unlikely that any club will meet the £85m release clause written into the West Ham contract of Kudus. It is even higher for Saudi Arabian clubs, who do indeed have their limits.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap\nThe highest-scoring new signing in the Premier League this season is one of only eight players aged 22 or under to reach double figures for goals in Europe’s top five divisions. It would be grossly unfair if Ipswich were able to bring that down to the Championship so the fact a £40m release clause becomes active upon their relegation makes sense.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola\nBournemouth have quietly gone seven games without a win in 90 minutes to bring their dream of European qualification combined with FA Cup glory crashing back down to reality. But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause with Spurs lurking in the shadows.",
      "Andre Berta has held fresh talks with a La Liga star as Arsenal look to fend off Chelsea and Newcastle, according to reports.",
      "We’re detecting a bit of sniffiness from Arsenal fans about the idea of signing Viktor Gyokeres. And we’re here to sniff at sniffiness.",

      "Man Utd, who beat Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate in their semi-final, will face Tottenham in the final of the Europa League later this month with the winners qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "There had been rumours that a loss in that match could prove costly for Amorim but The Guardian insisted yesterday that Man Utd ‘intend to retain’ Amorim ‘next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy believe that ‘the Portuguese deserves this summer transfer window to improve the squad and sign players better suited to his tactics’.",
      "And former Red Devils assistant manager Meulensteen would back that decision and insists that Amorim “will definitely be there at the start of the season”.",
      "In an exclusive interview with GiveMeSport, Meulensteen said: “You have to give Ruben another season. I’m sure he is not happy that he has not got more out of this squad in the Premier League. He keeps almost confirming that in every interview, which I find a little bit strange.",
      "“What people want to hear is a bit of reassurance. But if you keep saying ‘maybe I’m not the right man for the job’, it doesn’t sound good.",
      "“I don’t know why he keeps saying it. It has been an amazing run in the Europa League and, against Athletic Bilbao, they were very good over two legs. There were no problems and it was a really confident walk into the final.",
      "“But in the final they will play against Tottenham, who have had an equally disastrous season but it’s a Premier League team. Tottenham have definitely shown that they are capable of beating Manchester United.",
      "“They haven’t been firing on all cylinders but, if they have got everybody fit outside of James Maddison and as long as they’ve got Pedro Porro and Micky van de Ven fit and have stability in the backline, it’s a one-off game.",
      "“Amorim will definitely be there at the start of the season, but he has to make improvements in the first three months of the season in the Premier League.”",

      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to Real Madrid)\nLiverpool supporters have undeniably been burned by One Of Their Own choosing to fly the coop. The subsequent scorched-earth policy over Alexander-Arnold has resulted in some Anfield boos and could yet engulf murals, statues and even the official end date of his Liverpool contract.",
      "But the phrasing Liverpool used to confirm the imminent conclusion of a 21-year union felt deliberate while Real Madrid attempt to negotiate a small pay-off to facilitate a quicker exit. They stressed that Alexander-Arnold will leave ‘once his deal ceases on June 30, 2025,’ four days after the Spanish side’s final group game.",
      "If Liverpool are unmoved by the prospect of six-figure offers then Alexander-Arnold could join Los Blancos in time for the knockout stage, the first round of which could well pit Real against Manchester City. Thomas Tuchel could have a say too.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid)\nAs well as Alexander-Arnold and Alonso, it is thought that Real Madrid also want a new centre-half and left-back through the door as early as possible.",
      "William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate are on the shortlist for the former but both will be difficult to procure from elite Premier League sides and Champions League rivals at all, never mind so early in the window.",
      "There is also Jorrel Hato of Ajax, who seems a far more realistic possibility, or Castello Lukeba of Leipzig.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Carreras is the most prominent right-back mentioned, but they have a cheaper option on Juventus target Miguel Gutierrez after selling him to Girona a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Chelsea or Real Madrid)\nChelsea are inevitably expected to be busy, with the wonderfully vague latest round of speculation claiming they want A Winger and A Striker to arrive in time for the tournament.",
      "But their interest in Huijsen is clear, as is the level of competition they will face for him. Bournemouth are unlikely to stand in the way of the centre-half – and a £50m release clause renders that largely out of their hands anyway – and they might not mind if Chelsea’s desperation prevents a summer-long auction.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool are also in the running but Huijsen ‘dreams’ of Real Madrid and Xabi Alonso could have his new squad adorned with a shiny centre-half.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest to Manchester City)\nThe belief is that Manchester City will not struggle to agree personal terms with Gibbs-White, but talking Nottingham Forest into ruining European campaign preparations by selling a crucial player with two years left on his contract for anything less than a premium price might be slightly more difficult.",
      "But then winning the Club World Cup could earn almost £100m in prize money so if Gibbs-White can seamlessly replace Kevin de Bruyne the reported nine-figure fee would be repaid instantly.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Manchester City, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid)\nOne transfer saga already playing out involves a probable £100m playmaker, three European giants and an apparent family disagreement.",
      "While Wirtz himself remains open to any and all outcomes, it is believed that his father favours Bayern Munich and his mother has been championing the fourth option: staying at Leverkusen.",
      "That does seem unlikely after five successful years with the former Bundesliga champions, who stand to lose their manager and a couple of key players this summer.",
      "Wirtz might turn his back on a transitional season and Real Madrid have become contenders through their impending appointment of Alonso. Bayern will always be in contention for a player performing brilliantly in the Bundesliga, while Wirtz and his entourage flew in for talks with Manchester City recently.",
      "",
      "Tijjani Reijnders (Milan to Manchester City)\nInterest in Dutch midfielder Reijnders was said by David Ornstein and James Horncastle to be ‘independent’ of the moves for Gibbs-White and Wirtz, but Manchester City will still encounter difficulties over signing Reijnders.",
      "With ludicrous money planned to be spent elsewhere, PSR will come into play after Milan made it clear that they would settle for nothing less than a record sale. Kaka remains their most expensive outgoing transfer at £56m so the ballpark starts there.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix (Chelsea to Flamengo or Benfica)\nIt remains perhaps the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, playing out entirely predictably with barely any minutes for the Blues followed by a January loan to Milan during which precisely zero needles have moved.",
      "Yet the idea of Felix will forever entice sporting directors with more money than sense, so of course both Flamengo and Benfica have been linked with either a loan or a permanent move which would ideally be put in place in June, and probably lead to Chelsea being stunned that the Portuguese is under contract with them for another six years.",
      "",
      "Jorginho (Arsenal to Flamengo)\n“If Jorginho comes, it will be after the season in Europe ends. I hope it will be in time for the World Cup,” said Flamengo chief Jose Boto in early June. The Brazilian club’s manager, former title-winning Chelsea defender Filipe Luis, has “a lot of respect” for “a great player”.",
      "",
      "Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli to Flamengo)\nAfter two seasons in Saudi it seems that Firmino wants to enter the next and final phase of his career, rounding things off by playing in Brazil again for a bit.",
      "Flamengo are interested but could encounter complications if they pursue both Jorginho and Firmino, with a pair of players in their 30s stretching the wage bill perhaps too far.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs to Atletico Madrid)\nIt feels unlikely that Diego Simeone would put up with a fraction of the nonsense Romero has inflicted upon Spurs, but equally the Atletico manager is more likely than anyone to coach the ever-loving Christ out of that side of the World Cup winner.",
      "Romero landing at Atletico would be a remarkable and vaguely offensive fall upwards but negotiating with Daniel Levy in any instance seems perilous, never mind when working within a briefer window.",
      "There are suggestions emanating from Spain that the centre-half has agreed a five-year deal to move to the Spanish capital, but the paper that is signed on is worthless unless Spurs receive £60m.",
      "",
      "Alex Baena (Villarreal to Atletico Madrid)\nAtletico are expected to be busy and could use their Club World Cup spot as an excuse to expedite those summer plans.",
      "A disappointing drop-off in three competitions has persuaded Simeone to bring in reinforcements and beating Barcelona to the signature of Baena would be a fine start, although winning a transfer race against a side with no money should really be a given.",
      "Villarreal will be satisfied provided the 23-year-old’s £38.2m release clause is paid.",
      "",
      "Tom Bischof (Hoffenheim to Bayern Munich)\nLiverpool might closely monitor how talks between Hoffenheim and Bayern Munich go over an academy graduate’s early release from his contract in time to join up with new employers in the United States.",
      "The champions announced in January that Bischof would be joining upon the expiration of his Hoffenheim deal at the end of the season. That was before the ‘exceptional’ window was added, since which Bayern have decided they would quite like to open their present early actually.",
      "“Bayern have already contacted us. We won’t stand in Tom Bischof’s way,” said Hoffenheim sporting director Andreas Schicker. “If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” he added, with “good solution” in this instance apparently German for ‘suitable compensatory package’.",
      "Anything more than £500,000 and Liverpool will be forwarding copies of the deal to the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "Mats Hummels (Roma to Borussia Dortmund)\nWhile Hummels announced his imminent retirement from playing in April, he is human and the lure of facing Fluminense, Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns can only be resisted for so long.",
      "It can only be assumed that Roma are not particularly bothered about keeping the bench-warmer for any longer than is necessary, which means the one remaining obstacle to a stunning comeback is basically injury.",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck is sidelined for the foreseeable, and if Dortmund suffer one more setback in defence then chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has already publicly described an emergency deal for Hummels as “the first alternative”.",
      "",
      "David Hancko (Feyenoord to Juventus)\nTwo factors prevented Hancko from joining Liverpool and reuniting with Arne Slot this season, but the ship on his big move might not necessarily have sailed. After three years in the Eredivisie, Serie A might be calling.",
      "Juventus made their move in January but were greeted with a brick wall as Feyenoord refused to countenance the mid-season loss of two important players, Santiago Gimenez having already left for Milan.",
      "But their interest has not waned and the draw masters are hoping to welcome Hancko early, reportedly agreeing a five-year contract with the small matter of meeting the £25.5m asking price to come.",
      "",
      "Luis Henrique (Marseille to Inter)\nThe Champions League finalists are not resting on their laurels and have seen off competition from Juventus and Bayern Munich to agree personal terms with Marseille forward Henrique.",
      "Inter are eager to push the deal through in time for the Club World Cup, with Marseille only likely to be moved by offers of around £25.5m.",
      "",
      "Oumar Solet (Udinese to Inter)\nPetar Sucic is scheduled to arrive from Dinamo Zagreb for around £10m this summer, leaving defence as the remaining position of interest for the Italians.",
      "French youth international centre-half Solet only joined Udinese in January but has been mentioned; Genoa’s Koni De Winters is on a list of alternatives.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Victor Osimhen, Marco Silva, Nuno Espirito Santo, Simone Inzaghi, Xavi and Jose Mourinho to Al-Hilal\nThe money set aside for the doomed pursuit of Mo Salah has been retained by Al-Hilal while they identify the marquee name they would like instead. A £510m budget probably won’t be governed by PSR restrictions.",
      "Only two players have been named with any degree of conviction, with ‘top target’ Fernandes the subject of a ‘record-breaking’ move – reports of a £60m release clause have been rubbished – and £63.7m Osimhen always an option considering his availability.",
      "There is also the small matter of who has the honour of guiding Al-Hilal into the tournament, with Jorge Jesus sacked following defeat in the Asian Champions League semi-final.",
      "The well-connected Ben Jacobs produced a list of replacements including but not limited to the managers of Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Champions League finalists Inter and Fenerbahce, as well as the unoccupied Xavi.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Al-Hilal)\nLiverpool could also be heavily impacted by the Saudi side’s desperation to make a transfer statement ahead of the Club World Cup, with two known targets still on the radar.",
      "Nunez was the subject of at least one January bid from Al-Hilal, while Diaz was targeted by the same club in the summer of 2023. Liverpool could generate £136m with a double sale but it seems unlikely they will dispense with both.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr to anyone)\nSince it became clear his actual team would take no part, the media have done their utmost to deliver one final chapter in the Ronaldo v Messi story by linking the Portuguese with a temporary move to all manner of participating teams.",
      "The first round of speculation came before he extended a contract which was set to expire at the end of this season, when the idea of a one-month spell with one of the teams involved was mooted. Al-Hilal, Inter and Real Madrid were mentioned.",
      "In recent weeks Chelsea and Palmeiras have joined the ranks of clubs who cannot afford Ronaldo even for four weeks and know the circus surrounding him is not vaguely worth sacrificing squad harmony and morale.",
      "READ NEXT: Club World Cup 2025: What is it, why is it, who’s in it, should we care, and where can we watch on TV?",

      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid is reportedly ‘close’ to being confirmed as Liverpool have set the price for the Spanish giants to pay.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal are one of three Premier League clubs ready to pay £50m for Dean Huijsen, who ‘dreams’ of joining Real Madrid.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has told Liverpool team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold to “deal with it” after being booed in his first match since announcing he’ll leave the club.",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men."

      "Leeds United, Burnley and whoever else is unlucky enough to get promoted from the Championship need to get it right this summer, or their 2025/26 Premier League season will be full of misery.",
      "Daniel Farke is going to be a busy man, and exploring the loan market could be a stellar method to improve his squad and ultimately stay up.",
      "Here are 10 Premier League youngsters Leeds (or the clubs around them) should try to sign on loan in the summer transfer window…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nGod bless Brighton and their world-class recruitment team. Albion players account for 30% of this feature and it could have been a lot higher, ignoring Valentin Barco, Facundo Buonanotte and a couple of others. We start with former wonderkid-turned-disappointment Evan Ferguson.",
      "The Irish striker might think he has bigger fish to fry than newly promoted Leeds United, but we’re not sure. After all, he’s currently warming the bench for West Ham – a team 15th in the Premier League – after struggling to play for Brighton in the first half of 2024/25.",
      "There was talk in January of one of the ‘Big Six’, namely Arsenal, looking at him as an emergency option, but that never came close and he ultimately joined a wildly underperforming team who have been unable to improve under Julen Lopetegui’s replacement, Graham Potter.",
      "Brighton and Ferguson need to work out a way to untap the potential everyone was ranting and raving about in 2022, because his stock is falling dramatically and a player once guaranteed to fetch the Seagulls at least £100million is now worth less than half that amount. Another loan might be ruled out considering how poorly his Hammers spell has gone, but minutes are much more likely at a newly promoted team like Leeds, even if Joel Piroe bagged 19 in the Championship this term.",
      "WIN Europa League final tickets – and support the Red Cross",
      "",
      "Harry Amass (Manchester United)\nManchester United are in no way inclined to hand out favours to Leeds United and Leeds United are probably too proud to go to Old Trafford asking for help. Regardless, we have families to feed and want a Man United player in this list.",
      "There is, as always, logic behind this. Leeds are set to lose Junior Firpo – reportedly to Real Betis – and need to sign at least one left-back in the summer. Getting a promising Premier League youngster on loan is cost-effective, but if the profile is right, also very clever on-the-pitch-wise.",
      "Amass’ integration into the United first team has been far from seamless, even though we were told he’d fit Ruben Amorim’s system to a tee. He’s struggled, and that’s to be expected really, given how dysfunctional and easy to play against this United team is.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is the first-choice left-wing-back and Luke Shaw – also able to play left-centre-back – is likely ahead of Amass in the pecking order, so Amass could do with a year out on loan. Rivalries aside, we honestly think Elland Road would be perfect.",
      "",
      "Julio Enciso (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nEnciso is one of Brighton’s most promising youngsters and he has impressed on loan in a rubbish Ipswich Town team. Fingers cannot be pointed at the young Paraguayan for Ipswich’s relegation this season; he has been one of very few bright spots in a miserable campaign.",
      "He is the sort of player capable of getting you off your seat, whether that be with a 30-yard screamer or a piece of skill, which is one of the fundamentals you want from a young whippersnapper, as well as energy, commitment and effort. Which might all basically be the same thing.",
      "Brighton might be reluctant to send Enciso to a promoted club again considering the last six all went immediately back down without putting up much of a fight, but Leeds feel… different. If there’s a Championship club that stands a chance of staying in the Premier League, it’s them. There isn’t much logic to this other than they’re a big club with a rich history. Yep, it looks like we are relying on aura for a relegation battle. Excellent.",
      "",
      "Marc Guiu (Chelsea)\nThere is no way into the Chelsea team for poor Guiu, who turned down an equally difficult pathway at Barcelona to earn more money in London. Game time has been scarce and almost exclusively only in the league phase of the Europa Conference League, and it would make no sense to stagnate his career and development further by keeping him on the periphery again next season.",
      "He is only 19 and six goals in six European games is a positive sign, especially the first-half hat-trick he scored against… Shamrock Rovers. FFS. And we thought the financial disparity between Chelsea and semi-final opponents Djurgardens was bad.",
      "A hamstring injury has ruled Guiu out since February, but even so, he couldn’t get a kick in the Premier League when fit. Leeds and Burnley should give serious thought to signing the Spanish striker this summer, even if we’re not sure how good he is yet.",
      "",
      "Lewis Miley (Newcastle United)\nThis is ambitious, but not completely out of the question. Newcastle are set to return to the Champions League, barring a complete disaster, and will need a big squad in 2025/26 to ensure lightning doesn’t strike twice and they falter domestically as well as in Europe. That makes keeping Miley more sensible than sending him out on loan to Leeds, but there is still a strong chance it could be a career-defining move for the young Geordie.",
      "For a city obsessed with football, Newcastle doesn’t produce a vast amount of talent and Miley is arguably their best academy graduate this century. Eddie Howe will be very careful with his development and won’t make any rash loan decisions. Leeds will need to ensure they are right for him if by some chance they do target Miley. And if they get him, they’ve got a reyt gem.",
      "",
      "Ibrahim Osman (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nCurrently on loan at Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, Osman cost Brighton £16million last February and was sent to the Netherlands in August. Three goals and three assists in the Dutch top flight is pretty underwhelming, especially in comparison to Yankuba Minteh – who left Newcastle for Brighton last summer after a season at Feyenoord – and his 10 goals and three assists.",
      "Osman doesn’t seem ready to come in and play consistently for the Seagulls and after an average loan abroad, joining a newly promoted Premier League team feels like a natural next step.",
      "Leeds’ attack was devastating in the 2024/25 Championship, scoring 95 goals – a division high by 24. Second? Norwich City down in 13th, obviously. Still, they will need more quality up front, especially if Manor Solomon doesn’t join permanently or extend his loan.",
      "",
      "Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nSpeaking of which, the Whites could probably do with at least two new forwards. Finding a game-changing addition or their next Raphinha is a big ask, so the low-risk additions of Osman and/or West Ham’s Luis Guilherme could work.",
      "The issue with this one is that no-one really knows if Guilherme is any good. We’re not sure if Graham Potter even knows. The positive thing is that he’s a young Brazilian winger and Brazil have produced loads of world-class ones. Let’s just hope he can get closer to the level of Raphinha and Vinicius Junior than Marquinhos and Kenedy.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\nFocusing entirely on the forward areas would be naïve and very costly. As touched on already, a new left-back is a priority for Daniel Farke, but adding someone with the versatility of Acheampong would go a long way to providing the depth necessary to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Like most players at Chelsea, the 19-year-old is under contract for the foreseeable, signing an extension until 2029 last December, so the Blues clearly rate him highly, and if they do, there’s a strong chance they give him a loan to spread his wings in 2025/26.",
      "He is capable of playing right and centre-back, and there is not one downside we can think of for Leeds, Chelsea or Acheampong.",
      "",
      "Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThis is extremely unrealistic considering how much football Archie Gray has played this season, but considering it’s Leeds we are talking about, there is a chance… ever so slightly.",
      "The reasons for Spurs not sanctioning the loan exit of Gray are much more compelling than the reasons to do it, if we are not jumping the gun by going plural there.",
      "The 19-year-old used to play for Leeds and is welcome back at Elland Road. Go on, Spurs, make it happen; it could be the perfect way to give Gray some positional stability and ensure his progress is not further hindered.",
      "",
      "Stefan Bajcetic (Liverpool)\nForgotten Liverpool starlet Bajcetic has been on loan at RB Salzburg and Las Palmas this season, reuniting with Pep Lijnders in Austria. Jurgen Klopp’s old assistant manager lasted 29 games and six months before being sacked.",
      "Liverpool snapped up Bajcetic for a measly £224,000 in December 2020, making his first-team debut a little under two years later. After showing immense promise, injuries began to hold him back and a loan was the right call last summer. Still, it’s not been a comfortable year for the 20-year-old, who was recalled in January and instantly sent to Las Palmas in his native Spain.",
      "At least moving to La Liga was the right call. He’s played a lot more in his home country, but his performances haven’t been great. Next year could be make-or-break for Bajcetic, and Leeds signing him would be risky, but the potential reward is huge.",

      "A BBC report on Monday confirmed the news, stating that players will be restricted to two free tickets each for next week’s final, while first-team staff have also been told they won’t receive complimentary tickets.",
      "United’s logic is that they are “committed to ensuring as many tickets as possible from the club’s official 15,000 allocation go to supporters” — and definitely not because they don’t want to foot the bill for players’ families.",
      "On the bright side? They’ve been promised a barbecue if they beat Spurs. Whoop. Whoop.",
      "Now, the Daily Mail reports that players are ‘unhappy’ as Ratcliffe and his INEOS team remain ‘determined to keep costs to a minimum.’",
      "Those lucky enough to be invited will land 60 miles away from the final location in Bilbao on the morning of the match and ‘won’t have the chance to celebrate with the players if they beat Spurs’, as the return flight from Santander departs at 2:15am — more than an hour’s drive from San Mames.",
      "Players can buy up to ten more tickets at face value (£55 to £200), but must also pay for additional flights and hotel rooms. Meanwhile, a package through the club’s official travel partner reportedly costs around £900.",
      "The report adds that even players looking to charter their own private jets might struggle to find a landing slot in the Basque Country at such short notice.",
      "To rub salt in the wounds, travelling staff haven’t been granted complimentary tickets, while other full-time colleagues can only attend via a ballot.",
      "Those not travelling to Bilbao have been invited to a screening at Diecast in Manchester, where they’ll receive two free drinks — though their plus-ones will have to pay for themselves.",
      "In contrast, it’s been revealed that Spurs are offering a free ticket to every full-time employee.",

In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer.

But we feel those were two poor decisions,” he said.",

So it was a handball, I don’t know if it was, but everybody was screaming for it, so I did as well. Then there was the red card situation, then there was the penalty situation just afterwards. So there were a few things going against us, and I think sometimes you cannot hold your emotions, and that’s what you saw with me as well. He deserved to give me a yellow card. He should have given me, which he did. I deserved it. I have to put it like this,” he said.",

But they always fell down after they had ball possession and that took the energy out of the game in my opinion. I said to Ibou Konate, ‘This is a f**king joke.’ The fourth official thought I said to him: ‘You are a f**king joke.’ That’s definitely not what I said. I got a yellow for that so now I’m on two and I have to be careful,” he said.",

It’s difficult to judge for me because I only see it in real-time like the referee. We have to accept what VAR sees. You know how important these decisions can be.

There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions. That is definitely what I did,” he said.",

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and the top-flight is so great otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals.",
      "West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing. United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense.Lewis Jones",

      "Arsenal had two of their biggest tests of the season this week and how they close the gap to those two teams cannot be clearer now.",
      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",
      "United returned to earth with a bump three days after reaching the Europa League final as fellow strugglers West Ham secured their first Premier League win at Old Trafford since 2007.",
      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",

      "Asked how he changes the players' attitude given his struggles to do so, he said: \"I don't know, and I don't want to talk about players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",

      "So poor have United been that he even suggested that Champions League qualification may be an issue.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I'm not concerned about the final,\" he said. \"It's by far the smallest problem in our club. We need to change something that is deeper than this.",
      "\"We are showing that in the end of this season that playing Premier League and Champions League for us is the moon, so we need to know that.",
      "\"I'm not concerned about the final. They (the players) will be focused and I don't know what is best, if it's playing Champions League or not. So, let's think about Chelsea to improve a lot of things.\"",

A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",

One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",

      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",
      "Europa League glory to end the infamous trophy drought and qualify for the Champions League, despite a potential club-record Premier League low finish, would be a successful season for Spurs.Declan Olley"

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",
      "Their run to the last four, where they were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain, earned them roughly £70m in prize money, and that is before factoring gate receipts and commercial revenues.",
      "The winner of the final between Paris-Saint Germain will earn close to £100m in prize money.",
      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",
      "As we approach the end of the Premier League season, just seven points separate six teams fighting for the remaining places below champions Liverpool, whose place is already assured.",
      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",
      "Both sides are in the bottom half in the Premier League and not in the conversation for a top-five finish, but the Europa League winners earn qualification to the Champions League.",
      "An English Europa League winner does not mean the fifth-placed Premier League team lose their Champions League place."

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
