      "Former Manchester United starlet Daniel Nardiello was one of the first casualties of the Glazer family's takeover, being released by the club before earning just £90-a-week at Blackpool.",
      "This Monday marks 20 years since Malcolm Glazer launched his formal bid to take over the Red Devils. He acquired John Magnier and J.P. McManus' 28.7 per cent stake, boosting his own share to around 57 per cent. By the end of that month, he had a whopping 76 per cent ownership of the club.",
      "And by June, the American tycoon had secured 98 per cent of shares and control of United, causing outrage among fans for having funded his purchase with loans secured against the club's assets.",
      "Since then, the Glazers have been at the helm and faced repeated backlash for the decaying of the club's infrastructure as well as the team's decline on the pitch. In February 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was given complete control of football operations by the family after buying a minority stake in the club.",
      "One of the first moves made by the Glazers in June 2005 was to let go of a group of players. The released players included Coventry-born forward Nardiello, Northern Irish goalkeeper Roy Carroll, Spanish shot-stopper Ricardo, Republic of Ireland defender Paul Tierney and Gambian striker Arthur Gomez.",
      "Nardiello, who came through the academy ranks at Wolves, joined United in 1999 and quickly rose through the Under-17 and Under-19 teams to make his debut in 2000/2001 in the League Cup against Arsenal.",
      "The following season saw him mainly playing in the reserves, where he netted 12 goals before being loaned out to Swansea City for a month in October 2003.",
      "The Welsh international spent the latter half of the 2003/04 season on loan at Barnsley, scoring seven goals in 16 matches. He returned to Oakwell for the 2004/05 season on loan, adding another seven goals to his tally in 30 games.",
      "Deemed surplus to requirements by Sir Alex Ferguson and the new club hierarchy, he was released on June 30, 2005, ahead of the 2005/06 season, without playing a minute of Premier League football and having made just four appearances in all competitions.",
      "After his release, Nardiello signed a two-year contract with Barnsley in July 2005, scoring two crucial goals in their League One play-off matches that season. After two years, he rejected a new contract offer to sign for Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer, before rejoining Barnsley on loan in January 2008.",
      "He returned to QPR at the end of the 2007/08 season, after which he inked a two-year deal with another Championship side, Blackpool. His full debut for the Seasiders only came in January 2009 following an injury-plagued stint at the club.",
      "And it was there that he agreed to a contract clause, which meant he, along with the other Blackpool players, was only paid £90-a-week during the summer break. When asked about his bizarre wages on the Undr The Cosh podcast, Nardiello explained: \"I went to Blackpool, I was on decent wages but every summer for six weeks I was being paid £90 a week.",
      "\"It was just really weird. There were lads there playing in the Championship on £600-a-week and they had to save their pennies for the summer. It was like what the hell is going on. It was such a poorly run club.\"",
      "When quizzed on what the benefit of that was for the club, the 42-year-old replied: \"They just saved on everything that club. It wasn't a Championship-run club.",
      "\"You had to take your kit home every day and wash your kits, there was no heating in the training ground and the food they served was like slop, when players were turning up in Porsches and lovely cars on Championship wages.\"",
      "He continued: \"It was such a strange club to be a part of,\" before being asked if he knew about the bizarre rule before signing. Nardiello replied: \"I knew about the £90 quid before I signed because they told me.",
      "\"I think everyone did [struggle with it]. Because you go from whatever you're used to getting on a monthly basis and then one month you're getting next to nothing and you've still got your mortgage to pay and your bills to pay.\"",
      "During his two-year spell at Blackpool, he was loaned out to Hartlepool United, Bury and Oldham before making a permanent move to Exeter City in 2010. Nardiello only played nine games for Blackpool, scoring one goal.",
      "He later had stints at Rotherham United, Bury, Plymouth Argyle and Bangor City before retiring in October 2017, after being let go by the Welsh Premier League team."

      "Ruben Amorim cast doubt over his position following Manchester United's latest Premier League defeat. The Red Devils boss has failed to turn around the club's fortunes domestically with the club sitting 16th in the division.",
      "Only Europa League finalists Tottenham separate United from the bottom three clubs in the table, as Amorim was once again left to reflect on his difficulties as his team recorded their most extensive winless streak in the division. And following the goalless draw, it was the Portuguese coach who looked to shoulder the responsibility.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\".",
      "Despite that, it would appear United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a degree of sympathy for Amorim's position. It does not seem like it is his Europa League exploits keeping him in a job alone.",
      "Ratcliffe spoke earlier this season about the circumstances Amorim has had to work in, and with the side's form no better then, suggested the head coach was doing a good job.",
      "\"I think he’s done a great job in the circumstances, frankly, with the squad that he’s had available, the fact he came in mid-season,\" he explained in March.",
      "\"Everybody expects miracles overnight. It’s not the way, not real life in my view. I mean, you saw the performance yesterday (against Arsenal ).",
      "\"It was, I thought, a really impressive performance. They could not have worked harder. They couldn’t have been more committed.",
      "\"And if you looked at the names on the bench, there weren’t many you recognised, were there? Half the squad’s missing for Ruben.",
      "\"If you look at the top eight players in terms of salaries in Manchester United, 50 percent of those are not available to Ruben. You’ve got Mason Mount, you’ve got Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford has gone, and Jadon Sancho (on loan at Chelsea ).",
      "\"And he’s got a bunch of other injuries as you know, so I think he’s done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim is not content and knows he must improve his side's Premier League outings. The 40-year-old expressed his discontent on Sunday.",
      "Amorim added: \"I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "\"So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.\""

      "Sir Alex Ferguson was asked to resign amid Manchester United's takeover by the Glazer family in 2005. Not by the club's owners but by United supporters hoping to take control of the club themselves.",
      "Almost 20 years ago, on May 12, Red Football - the Glazers' holding company - confirmed it had reached an agreement with Manchester United shareholders JP McManus and John Magnier to purchase a 28.7 per cent stake in the club. That would ultimately see United's board write to the remaining shareholders to reveal their intention to sell and advise the recipients to do the same.",
      "Before that tipping point there remained hope in some corners that the infamous takeover could be prevented. To prevent a historic, debt-free club being saddled with £580million of debt in a leveraged takeover.",
      "Andy Walsh was part of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA), and among a group of fans working on a rival bid for the club via Shareholders United and the Japanese bank Nomura. Wash had developed a relationship with Ferguson and made a late plea in his desire to stop the Glazers.",
      "\"My call to Alex Ferguson was to ask him to consider resigning,” Walsh told The Athletic. \"He genuinely believed the supporters should be heard in the takeover.\"",
      "“Our last throw of the dice,\" Walsh added. \"It was a highly leveraged takeover and major corporate financiers were already shying away based on what was being proposed.",
      "“We felt any loss of support from senior management executives — Ferguson and Gill — would have dealt a fatal blow.”",
      "Walsh's plan would have hoped Ferguson's resignation would see the deal collapse. Ferguson would then return to his position off the back of the fan-led offering, but it was not a risk the Scotsman was willing to take.",
      "“If the deal collapsed, Ferguson would then be carried back into the stadium on the shoulders of supporters,\" he said.",
      "\"Ferguson politely declined, believing he had a responsibility not just to himself and his family, but also all the people he had brought to Old Trafford and were working under him. We were asking him to take a huge risk. There was no legal undertaking we could give him. Just a word.",
      "\"We believed the club would then be controlled by fans rather than people draining it for personal profit. That was the point I made to Alex Ferguson in that call. But I fully respect and understand his decision.”"

      "Arsenal have pushed both Liverpool and Manchester City over recent seasons, while they reached the Champions League semi-finals this term. But former Manchester United goalkeeper Schmeichel reckons Arteta’s methods could actually be doing more damage than good.",

      "“Then it’s his own team and then in the process, he’s now changed the job description so he’s now the manager. Everything is on him. It’s not recruitment, it’s not the board.",
      "“Whenever they [fans] get the opportunity today, watch him in the technical area. Arteta is a control freak, he wants his players to play the ball that he wants. He’s directing everything.",
      "“You look across to Arne Slot who’s so calm. He’s instructed his players in training, instructed the players in the team talk. Arteta is still playing the game for the players and that would confuse the hell out of me as a football player that you had a coach that wants to direct me for everything I do. It would confuse me and make me a worse player.”",
      "Schmeichel is not the only one who has commented on Arteta’s position. Ex-Liverpool star Jamie Carragher has noticed a change in demeanour from the Arsenal boss, believing he is now potentially looking for excuses behind the club’s failure to win a trophy.",

      "\"I think deep down he thinks they could have won the league without this and that. There's no doubt they would be a lot closer but the sendings-off are down to you. They weren't all sendings-off, but that can happen in a season.",
      "\"The injuries have hit them this season but they also played for them last season. What they have done in terms of competing Man City in the last two seasons is fantastic but a lot of that was down to having the same eight or nine players week in, week out, and him never rotating.\""

Just 72 hours after beating Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate to reach the Europa League final, Amorim and his players were cast back in their familiar role this season as the Premier League's laughing stock.",
      "Since taking over in November, Amorim has overseen 25 Premier League games, losing 13 and winning just six, to leave United languishing down in 16th place. This defeat was their 17th in the league this season, the most since they were relegated in 1974, with United having lost more league games at home this season than away – nine at Old Trafford compared to eight on the road.",
      "No wonder there were great swathes of empty red seats all around the stadium, long before the final whistle. It is a truly abysmal record, one that would surely have got Amorim the sack at the end of the season, were it not for an all or nothing shot at redemption in the shape of the Europa League final.",
      "Just as winning the FA Cup last season saved Erik ten Hag, albeit only for a few months, lifting the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on May 21 is likely to prolong Amorim's tenure.",
      "But defeat to Tottenham in the San Mames Stadium, on the back of such a lamentable domestic campaign, will see legitimate questions asked about Amorim's future. Even though Amorim made six changes to the side that overcame Bilbao, there was enough talent and experience within his starting line-up to produce a more competitive performance than the limp offering that has become an all-too familiar story for United this season.",
      "In contrast, West Ham were ebullient from start to finish and worthy winners, taking the lead in the 26th minute, with former United full-back Aaaron Wan-Bissaka playing Mohammed Kudus in behind the home defence. Kudus feigned to cross, fooling Amad and allowing him time and space to drill a delivery into the six-yard box, where Tomas Soucek was waiting to turn the ball over the line.",
      "It was no more than the visitors deserved, after a confident and enterprising start to the game, in contrast to the hosts, who lacked fluency in their build-up play and had no cutting edge up front. Rasmus Hojlund, with just four Premier League goals all season, continued to toil up front, his ineffective display underlining the need for United to sign a prolific and proven scorer this summer, to lead their insipid attack.",
      "Hojlund found himself through on goal just after the half-hour mark, courtesy of a delivery from Manuel Ugarte, but the £72million forward produced a slapstick attempt at controlling the ball, which flew off his right boot and behind for a goal-kick.",
      "James Ward-Prowse was presented with a chance to double West Ham's lead two minutes after the restart, but sent his low shot straight at United keeper Altay Bayindir. But Graham Potter's side made it 2-0 in the 57th minute, Ugarte weak in possession and giving up the ball cheaply under pressure from Wan-Bissaka, enabling Kudus to surge towards the United goal.",
      "Kudus saw his shot blocked, the ball spun to Wan-Bissaka, who picked out Jarrod Bowen at the far post, the West Ham skipper presented with the simplest of finishes from close-range. Hojlund looked certain to score with 11 minutes left, but Alphonse Areola pulled off a fine save at point-blank range to deny him, moments after sub Harry Haguire had flashed a header wide."

The 19-year-old received treatment for an injury early in the second half but was unable to continue, with Harry Maguire having to come on.",

      "Despite United having nothing to play for domestically Amorim's decision to name a team with the majority of his regulars looks to have backfired. Even with several of their big guns playing the Red Devils' poor record at Old Trafford continued against West Ham.",

      "Less than 24 hours before his exit, the Dutchman's United had suffered a 2-1 defeat by West Ham, courtesy of a controversial last-gasp penalty from Jarrod Bowen, after winning only four of their 14 games to start the campaign.",
      "United faced the Hammers for the first time since that fateful fixture this Sunday at Old Trafford. Both sides are enduring torrid seasons as they sit way down in the bottom half of the table. Amorim's men lost 2-0 in yet another afternoon to forget.",
      "And it was extremely telling that, just over six months after Ten Hag's sacking, two of the three players he reportedly took issue with were not only not involved against West Ham, but no longer at the club.",
      "It's fair to say that the majority of the Dutchman's squad was sub-par throughout his tenure. But the Daily Star reported at the time that the head coach was particularly frustrated by Casemiro, Antony and Marcus Rashford, who he believed were partially responsible for his exit.",
      "Rashford only scored once in the league this season under Ten Hag and has spent the past year making headlines for the wrong reasons.",
      "The misfiring striker's long-term dip in form left his manager without a goal-scorer, having managed to net 17 (30 in all competitions) during Ten Hag's debut season.",
      "Meanwhile, Casemiro also suffered a dip in form after an impressive first season at Old Trafford. He suddenly appeared to lack the fitness required at the top level and made several errors leading to goals, which didn't help the Dutchman's cause.",
      "Antony, too, was specifically signed by Ten Hag for a whopping £86million in the hope that he'd recreate the performances he displayed under the manager at Ajax. He came nowhere near justifying that price tag in the end and stained Ten Hag's transfer record.",
      "Amorim, who took the helm in November, appears to share his predecessor's feelings. He used Antony sparingly and froze Rashford out of his squad in late 2024, before sending them out on loan in January to Real Betis and Aston Villa, respectively.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, has also been used sparingly by the Portuguese in the league. He has been left on the bench as an unused substitute 13 times since his arrival.",
      "While Antony and Rashford appear to have played their last games as United players, the Brazilian midfielder at least has the opportunity to lift some silverware when the Red Devils take on Tottenham in the Europa League final on May 21."

United showed some positive play in the early stages but it was the visitors who were able to find a way through.",
      "Brilliant build-up play saw Aaron Wan-Bissaka play in Mohammed Kudus, who smartly sent Amad to the floor before firing the ball across the box. Tomas Soucek was on hand to nudge the ball between Harry Amass' legs and into the net from close range.",
      "United showed all of the quality their league position suggests in the second period as Manuel Ugarte quickly fell to the floor under pressure in his own half to spark another attack for the Irons. Wan-Bissaka was involved again to provide a perfect ball across the six-yard box for Jarrod Bowen to double his side's lead.",
      "Mason Mount, Amad, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo all came off the bench and sparked a change in United's second leg Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao. They were tasked with impressing from the start as Ruben Amorim's stars now all vie for a place to play in the European final.",
      "A curling cross-field ball from Mount to Amad hinted at what could be unleashed from the troop at their best, and the latter often proved to be full of pace and tempo to provide a threat. But one again, as with most United stars this season, there were difficult moments.",
      "Mainoo struggled in an advanced position that had seen Bruno Fernandes dropped deeper, and Luke Shaw's positioning was far from perfect in a back three. There will be tough decisions to make ahead of the Europa League final and Amad probably has the best chance to keep his place for now.",
      "While some players will be performing with an eye on facing Spurs in Bilbao, otherwise will be hoping to prove to Amorim that they are worthy of a squad spot next year and others, perhaps their next club.",
      "Altay Bayindir started his second Premier League game in succession for the Red Devils and likely faces the prospect of playing to show his ability to a new team, should he want to find first time football. The Turkish ace earned his spot in net with Andre Onana being rested and despite the No.1's failures this season, Bayindir has failed to offer an argument he should take his position.",
      "Sunday saw an unconvincing outing for the goalkeeper who was unable to provide an authorative presence and showed some questionable communication. Tested early in the second period by James Ward-Prowse, Bayindir stood up to the task but he may be required to do more to have teams knocking at the door and to turn slow down United's search for a new shotstopper.",
      "In the opposite net, Alphonse Areola proved to be a wall as United knocked on the door in the second half and pulled off an impressive 79th-minute save to deny Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Leny Yoro looked downbeat as he was guided off the pitch with an injury. Never a good sign with a final to come in 10 days time. Ruben Amorim's team selections have been hampered by injury in recent months, and even for this game Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Toby Collyer were all watching on from the directors' box.",
      "Amorim immediately replaced Luke Shaw alongside Yoro, seeming to want to protect the player as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof came into play. There could certainly be a nervous week for United as they prepare for their lone chance at success this season.",
      "Only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton had earned fewer points than the Irons since Graham Potter's first match in charge of the club. They had been winless in eight games heading to Old Trafford where winning is not something the Londoners experience often.",
      "Potter managed to see United's central weakness and offered Mohammed Kudus plenty of freedom to cause the home side issues throughout the game. Given their position in the league, few teams offer better chance to pick up three points than United and Potter's side ultimately took advantage.",
      "Earning three points at the Theatre of Dreams will offer an important boost to West Ham's boss, and its reputation will offer some credibility even with United's deficiencies. It was critical for Potter to find that heading into next season.",
      "From a United perspective, given another defeat, you would hope not. Heading into the afternoon, the highest the club could finish was 12th and a positive result for the Hammers would see them leapfrog their hosts.",
      "\"We can't save anything from the Premier League,\" Amorim said ahead of the game. \"But we do have to acknowledge we are - and we need to win games.\"",
      "It was not on the agenda at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Red Devils had big chances but perhaps offered their opponents better ones.",
      "The club are in a battle for 17th and avoiding that will likely take a backseat to any European aspirations. Wins will be wanted, but that does not feel in United's control in the division."

      "This will be the first time a charitable organisation has appeared on the front of a United shirt for a league fixture. The move has been backed by legendary skipper Gary Neville.",
      "He said: \"By donating the front-of-shirt logo, Snapdragon is showing the world that football can drive real change. Together, we can unite millions of fans to fight global health injustice, harnessing the power of football to make a difference and create a brighter future.\"",
      "In a further move in support of the charity, United, Snapdragon and RED have collaborated with Adidas to create a limited-edition merchandise collection. All net proceeds will be donated to the Global Fund, while fans will also be able to bid for the shirts worn during the matches, with the money raised also supporting the cause.",
      "Amorim meanwhile is focused on protecting his players ahead of the crucial final against Tottenham. He said: \"What I will protect is the players that can get an injury. We have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.",
      "\"Again, we cannot save anything from the Premier League. But I think it's a good thing for them as we'll not have a lot of trainings. They will fight for the places in the final in these games.",
      "\"We also have to acknowledge that we are Manchester United and we need to win games, also in the Premier League, and we have to use every game to improve, even to prepare for the final, but, especially, to prepare for the future.",
      "\"We are trying to do our best but I agree, we can do better. But I have to make a choice. What is the best for the club not what is the best for me. I make a choice in this moment [that] I'm going to try to save all the players because it's really important for us to win the final.\""

      "Despite their struggles in domestic competitions, Ange Postecoglou's side have managed to defeat the Red Devils three times this season. For Spurs, lifting the trophy would break a 17-year drought, while for United, it could provide a silver lining to a disappointing season.",
      "It's worth noting that the Europa League winners automatically secure a spot in next season's Champions League. However, for United, this might not be a given.",
      "Previous UEFA rules stated that two clubs under the same ownership can't compete in different European competitions. As Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stakes in both Man United and Ligue 1 team Nice, it would have been impossible for both clubs to play in Europe.",
      "Despite a 2-0 loss to Rennes on Saturday, Nice are well-positioned to qualify for next season's Champions League as they currently sit fourth in the Ligue 1 table.",
      "Last year, the regulations were tweaked to accommodate multiple clubs under the same ownership, with each case being evaluated individually. This is evident in Manchester City and Girona, both part of the City Group, participating in this season's tournament.",
      "United have already encountered issues due to Ratcliffe's involvement with Nice, as seen when Jean-Clair Todibo's move to Old Trafford was blocked. However, there are two reasons for United to remain optimistic about the situation.",
      "Ratcliffe is reportedly considering selling the French club. If the sale goes through before a specific date, assuming United wins the Europa League and Nice secures a Champions League qualification spot, there should be no problems.",
      "Furthermore, it has been clarified that there isn't a one-size-fits-all rule for every situation. Even if Ratcliffe retains stakes in both clubs, there's still a possibility for both to compete among Europe's top teams, as indicated by a UEFA statement.",
      "The statement asserted that \"no one is simultaneously involved, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition; and no one has control or decisive influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\"",
      "Therefore, all that's really required is evidence that the two clubs aren't managed concurrently. Ratcliffe's intention to sell his stake in Nice could certainly strengthen their case if the worst happens."

      "Yoro's injury didn't look good",
      "Leny Yoro delivered one of his finest performances for United against Athletic Bilbao. His driving runs out from the back were superb, but his position was slightly tweaked on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Although Yoro has looked best when playing on the left side of the back-three, where he started last Thursday night, he started in the centre of the defence to accommodate Luke Shaw.",
      "Amorim went surprisingly strong with his team selection, which had the potential to backfire, and that happened when Yoro appeared to pick up a foot injury at the start of the second half.",
      "Yoro was replaced by Harry Maguire and his body language didn't look good as he returned to the dressing room. His demeanour seemed to suggest he knew he would be spending some time on the sidelines, which would be a huge blow ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "The Bilbao chants",
      "United suffered their 17th defeat of the Premier League season against West Ham and the same dross that has been served up at Old Trafford throughout the campaign was dished out again.",
      "West Ham deserved their 2-0 victory and Amad's performance was probably the only positive for United, so it was no surprise to see the Stretford End sing about going to Bilbao with minutes to play.",
      "The Europa League campaign has given fans something to cling onto this season and United must deliver the goods.",
      "Amorim looked nervous",
      "Hojlund went down with a shoulder injury just before half-time. The physio sprinted to give Hojlund medical treatment and the televisions in the press box showed Amorim nervously biting his fingers rather than his fingernails.",
      "It was a risk to start the only available senior striker and Amorim's heart would have been in his mouth as Hojlund received treatment, but he was fine to continue.",
      "United will face Chelsea in the Premier League before the Europa League final on May 21 and it would be logical to rest Hojlund, given he's the only senior centre-forward who is available.",
      "Fernandes had words with Mainoo",
      "It took just 10 minutes for Bruno Fernandes to have words with Kobbie Mainoo, who started in the No.10 role again after playing in the pivot for successive league games against Bournemouth and Brentford.",
      "Mainoo's position has regularly been tweaked by Amorim, which has made it difficult for him to find his groove, and he was shouted at by Fernandes for not making a run between the lines.",
      "Fernandes gave Mainoo an earful and the youngster nodded as his captain explained where he should have been. The advanced midfield role does not come naturally to Mainoo and the jury remains out on whether that should be his permanent role in Amorim's system.",
      "Dalot chats to Brailsford",
      "Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox and Sir Dave Brailsford were present in the directors' box, and the latter exchanged words with Diogo Dalot as the defender took his seat minutes before kick-off.",
      "Brailsford acknowledged Toby Collyer before chatting with Dalot, who could be ruled out for the remainder of the season with a calf injury picked up last month.",
      "Brailsford's involvement at the club has been questionable since Ineos' investment was signed off, and there will be even more scrutiny on his role if United are beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final."

      "They rose to 16th thanks to Tottenham, predictably beaten by Crystal Palace on their own patch. The Europa League finalists are also battling to outdo each other for the worst team not to be relegated from the top flight. \"If you beat Spurs, you're not all c***s,\" is just about the nicest thing West Ham's away-dayers have ever said to United.",
      "A West Ham staff member said to a colleague at half-time, \"If we win, we'll rinse this.\" West Ham had won four games on the road all season and they have left Old Trafford with three points for the first time since 2007. They had not won in nearly three months. Yet United are winless in the league in two months.",
      "West Ham are above United in the table now. United's numbers are worth outlining in black and white for anyone prepared to cut this United squad any slack: played 36, won 10, drawn nine, lost 17 and with a -11 goal difference. United last lost 17 league games in a single season in 1973-74. Ie. the relegation season. Their goal difference was actually better under Tommy Docherty's doomed squad.",
      "West Ham's followers chided Rasmus Hojlund with a chorus of \"F*****g useless\". That could have applied to the entire United side. They had signings purchased for £72million, £60m, £58m and £67m in their starting XI. United discovered years ago it is not about quantity but quality.",
      "United could realistically lose half of their 38 league fixtures. Chelsea and Aston Villa, their remaining opponents, are in pressing need of points in the attempt to qualify for the Champions League. The latter is four days after the Europa League final.",
      "Still the United matchgoers refuse to turn, not when there is a cup final on the horizon. The first half ended without any boos. There were none at full-time, either.",
      "The odd matchgoer vented, at Harry Amass deciding against a cross or the lack of pressing from Hojlund. The United denizens mostly stayed silent. That silence spoke volumes.",
      "United's supporters have become so accustomed to defeat they are apathetic. There was barely a murmur of discontent at their bottom-place finish in the Champions League group stage last season. Those feel like heady days now. Their league position is doubly worse than last year's eighth.",
      "The afternoon was compounded by a significant injury. Leny Yoro was able to walk off but his body language was downbeat. He was clutching his left foot when the physio Jordan Reece assessed him.",
      "Amorim immediately replaced Yoro and Luke Shaw, suddenly a genuine contender to start in Bilbao if Yoro does not recover within ten days. Shaw has not completed 90 minutes for his club since February last year.",
      "Despite the sunshine and serenity, Bruno Fernandes was not easy like Sunday morning. He rebuked Kobbie Mainoo for his positioning as early as the 12th minute while Yoro had the ball. Fernandes elaborated on his gripe when the ball went dead.",
      "With Fernandes back in midfield, United effectively accommodated four No.10s. Having been too defensive-minded against Athletic Bilbao, the balance was too extreme in the opposite direction.",
      "Amad, starting for the first time in three months, was effectively pitted against Mohammed Kudus. That was proven to be a mismatch when the Ghanaian held off Amad to drive the ball in for Tomas Soucek, holding off Harry Amass in another mismatch, to cutely flick the ball in.",
      "Amorim fretted over Noussair Mazraoui's fitness on Thursday evening yet he stayed in the starting line-up. Mazraoui at right centre back and Amad on the right wing was possibly a trial for the Europa League final. Amad teed up Fernandes for an early shot, drew the only save from Alphonse Areola in the first half and played Hojlund in. Amad was United's only positive.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka was greeted by Fernandes, Yoro and Victor Lindelof in the tunnel on his return. He was serenaded more often by the travelling Cockneys in five minutes than he was in five years at Old Trafford. He showed why he is serenaded so often with a canny reverse pass for the opening goal.",
      "Wan-Bissaka arguably saved his best performance at Old Trafford for his first visit as an opponent. He pickpocketed Manuel Ugarte and perceptively squared the ball for Jarrod Bowen to tap in for 2-0.",
      "Ugarte has admitted that physicality is the biggest difference between the Europa League and the Premier League. His dawdling on the ball encapsulated this United side in a microcosm. Every weekend, they live up to their 'worst-since-relegated' billing.",
      "West Ham's followers singled out Hojlund and he failed to convert a Harry Maguire knockdown three yards out from goal. David Moyes was in attendance and both of his former teams were better off with him in the dugout.",
      "There were plenty of answers to the West Ham fans' question."

      "Kobbie Mainoo's position has regularly been tweaked by Ruben Amorim in a stop-start season for the youngster.",
      "Mainoo started successive Premier League games against Bournemouth and Brentford in the deeper midfield role, but he was relocated to the No.10 position against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "It took just 10 minutes to see why Mainoo probably shouldn't be playing as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's system. He was in the wrong position when Bruno Fernandes was scanning the options in front of him, which led to the youngster receiving an earful from an unhappy Manchester United captain.",
      "Mainoo nodded as he listened to Fernandes' instructions. You cannot fault his effort and willingness to play in that role, but it's probably time to accept he's not as effective there.",
      "Amad and Leny Yoro were the only players in red to emerge with any credit from the first half, but Mainoo looked notably lost in the No.10 role and Amorim pushed him back after West Ham scored their second of the match.",
      "Mainoo returned from a muscle injury away against Lyon on April 10 and Amorim has made it difficult for him to find rhythm. He has continued to tinker with his position in recent weeks.",
      "A source close to the player has played down the effect the changes are having on Mainoo. All the evidence suggests he is not at his best when he plays in the No.10 role in Amorim's system, which even Amorim recognised when he dropped him back to play alongside Fernandes.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was hooked after he was dispossessed in the build-up for Jarrod Bowen's simple goal. The 24-year-old suffered a disappointing afternoon and it was logical to drop Mainoo back.",
      "Mainoo was slightly better after the tweak - West Ham were leading by two at that stage - because his qualities are almost certainly better suited to the deeper midfield position.",
      "Amorim is undecided about which role suits Mainoo best in his formation and it would be a shock if he started in the Europa League final, despite him starring in the FA Cup final 12 months ago.",
      "Imagine telling supporters after last season's FA Cup final that Mainoo could leave in the summer? They wouldn't have believed you, but an exit from his boyhood club is not off the cards.",
      "It would be a sad state of affairs if Mainoo leaves because he is a supremely talented young player. Having said that, it might be a move that eventually makes sense for both parties.",
      "Mainoo still doesn't have a settled role in this United team, but it's something he could perhaps be offered by another club. United would also bank a decent fee for an academy graduate if he did leave.",
      "It's been a difficult 12 months for Mainoo and tweaking his position hasn't helped him."

It’s quite simple to understand we would have had much better results if we didn’t have to navigate this. So, either you understand or you don’t and beat us over the head, I get it.",

      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "Manchester United's build-up to their Europa League final clash with Tottenham begins on Sunday when Ruben Amorim's men welcome West Ham United to Old Trafford.",
      "With their Premier League season null and void, United's focus is on the European showdown on May 21 in Bilbao. Before that, they play twice looking to build confidence.",
      "West Ham travel to Old Trafford looking to turn their form around having hit a slump in recent weeks. Since beating Ruud van Nistelrooy's at the end of February, the Hammers have gone eight games without a victory, losing four times.",
      "The match will kick-off at 2.15pm on Sunday, May 11 at Old Trafford.",
      "No, unfortunately the match hasn't been selected to be broadcasted in the United Kingdom this weekend. The game has been moved to Sunday owing to United's participation in the Europa League on Thursday night.",
      "Because it was scheduled to be a 3pm kick-off on Saturday, the fixture falls in the middle of the FA's black-out restrictions.",
      "The match will be broadcast across the globe through the Premier League's international broadcast partners.",
      "Arena Premium will showcase the game in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Turkey viewers will be able to watch the game on beIN Sports with France and Czech Republic getting coverage from Canal+.",

      "Manchester United will be going in search of a first Premier League home win since February when they welcome West Ham United to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Despite progressing to the Europa League final in midweek with a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their semi-final showdown, United's Premier League form has been nothing short of dire in the last few months, winning just two of their last 12 league outings.",
      "Heading into the clash with Hammers winless in their last six league games, the Reds will be determined get three points on the board and increase their confidence levels ahead of the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in just over a week's time.",
      "Regarding the team news, head coach Ruben Amorim is expected to rotate his pack for the second league game running, meaning multiple changes are likely.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up this afternoon:",
      "Amorim isn't going to make wholesale changes to his United side over the next few games but this feels like the ideal opportunity to give some players a rest and get minutes into others, starting in goal, where Tom Heaton deserves a game as he gets closer to signing a one-year contract extension.",
      "In defence, Shaw and Fredricson can come back in. Shaw needs the minutes as he builds up fitness and although Fredricson struggled in the second half last week, this should be easier. Maguire can play the experienced role in the middle.",
      "Amass can get another game at left wing-back and Amad needs a start on the right as he builds up to starting the Europa League final. Ugarte and Mainoo are the midfield pairing.",
      "Mount has to start again after his efforts this week, with Eriksen alongside him, and Obi can come back into the side as Hojlund gets a rest.",
      "Despite having no midweek game to consider this coming week, Amorim should still use the visit of the Hammers to shuffle his pack and increase the fitness levels of players still working their way towards full-match sharpness.",
      "Shaw has rotated between starter and sub in recent games, meaning he should be recalled and start on the left of the back-three. Mazraoui has been pushed to his limit in recent weeks, meaning Kamason deserves the nod at right wing-back to make his debut.",
      "Casemiro and Ugarte are a sure bet to start alongside each other in midfield in the Europa League final, meaning they should not be risked less than 72 hours after their last outing.",
      "Obi, despite struggling to make his mark at Brentford last week, will only improve by playing, meaning he deserves a second start. Amad and Mount deserve starts after their impacts off the bench on Thursday night."

      "‘You’ll never win anything with kids.’",
      "Alan Hansen’s immortal words have gone down in football folklore. Uttered in 1995 after Manchester United had opened the campaign with defeat at Aston Villa. The Reds had ceded the Premier League title to Blackburn a few months earlier and lost an FA Cup final to Everton.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson’s response was to offload senior players Mark Hughes, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis and blood the youngsters.",
      "In hindsight it was an obvious decision but that afternoon at Villa Park United side featuring Gary and Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes were three down at the break. Sub David Beckham pulled one back late on but it was a game that trailed more questions than answers.",
      "United were dumped out of the UEFA Cup by Russian minnows Rotor Volgograd and the League Cup by York City. Yet a few months on the Reds were celebrating a domestic double.",
      "Next season will mark 30 years since that campaign that changed so much for United. And while Ruben Amorim doesn’t quite have a golden generation to call upon to change his side’s fortunes, he has enough young talent to spearhead a Reds revival.",
      "Amad Diallo is already a first team regular at 22 and has been one of the standout players of this campaign, with his cameo off the bench against Athletic Bilbao last week the latest stellar showing.",
      "Leny Yoro too has acclimatised nicely to life at Old Trafford after an injury hit campaign. The £52million man has started to adapt to the system and while there is still room for improvement, his capabilities have been clear for all to see in recent weeks.",
      "It’s easy to forget that Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho are both just 20 with the pair having carried the burden for United under Erik ten Hag and while speculation surrounds the futures of both as United grapple with PSR, the duo would be welcome additions to most top teams.",
      "Mainoo is the poster boy for the academy having come through the ranks as a local lad - something left back Harry Amass will hope to emulate having belatedly made his debut in recent weeks. Midfielder Toby Collyer has also caught the eye when called upon this season.",
      "Then there’s former Arsenal pair Ayden Heaven - who looked to the manner born for large parts of his four United outings so far until injury struck - and Chido Obi. There is understandably a lot of excitement around the latter given his goal record and first team involvement, although patience must be preached at senior level with a 17-year-old trying to make his way.",
      "Nonetheless the hope at Old Trafford will be that Obi becomes a future first team fixture up front and suddenly United have eight potential regulars aged 22 and under.",
      "There’s plenty of others coming through the ranks who will hope to have their say too. Tyler Fredricson has broken through while Godwill Kukonki, Jack Fletcher, Sekou Kone and Jaydon Kamason could follow suit.",
      "No one is suggesting they can emulate the success of the Class of 92 but that octet can form a bedrock to build around alongside the sprinkling of senior stars United either possess or seek to sign.",
      "A top goalkeeper and a proven goal getter are prime transfer targets, but United have a production line with the potential to provide plenty.",
      "The kids could be more than alright."

      "The 55-year-old was relieved of his duties at Old Trafford in October last year, a decision that came just a day after his team suffered a 2-1 Premier League defeat to West Ham at the London Stadium.",
      "As the Red Devils prepare to face the east London club on Sunday, it marks the first encounter since the initial clash that led to Ten Hag's dismissal after more than two years at the helm.",
      "United's loss to West Ham was their fourth in nine league matches, leaving them in a dismal 14th place in the standings – a situation the club's top brass ultimately found untenable.",
      "\"I'd get rid of him; I would have gotten rid of him three months ago,\" O'Hara declared. \"I wouldn't have gave him a contract after the FA Cup, I'd have said, 'Thanks very much, you've finished with a trophy, go out on a high.\"",
      "\"They should have got something from the game today but overall they've been poor. I've watched them in the Europa League as well and they've been poor.\"",
      "The pundit's prediction hit the mark; less than a day later, Ten Hag was dismissed by United, as confirmed in their official statement. The announcement read: \"We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future.",
      "\"Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited.\"",
      "Despite the coaching change, and whilst it took over two weeks for Ruben Amorim to come on board, United's performance continued to decline. Post-Christmas, they have exclusively languished in the bottom half of the table and now find themselves in 15th with only three matches remaining.",
      "Conversely, Amorim stands on the cusp of glory, poised for a European title in his debut season, as his team prepares to face Tottenham Hotspur in the forthcoming Europa League final.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham too witnessed a shift in their managerial lineup, with Julen Lopetegui getting the boot early January, following a heavy defeat at Manchester City.",
      "Ex-Chelsea boss Graham Potter was ushered in as his successor; however, the London club has seen minimal improvement, securing a mere three wins from their last 15 league outings, leaving them perilously close to the relegation zone at 17th place."

      "The summer transfer window may not open until next month but Manchester United's early intentions have been clear for a few weeks now.",
      "The probable £92.5m cost of Cunha and Delap would be offset by the planned sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, all of whom are currently away from Old Trafford on loan.",
      "Cunha, who has 17 goals and six assists to his name this season, is set to be a man in demand this summer having impressed for Wolves for a number of seasons now. His representatives have welcomed United's interest and the Brazilian international is said to be keen to join the club.",
      "It has long been known United's season rests on success in the Europa League, where lifting that trophy comes with the added bonus of qualifying for next season's Champions League.",
      "United face Tottenham, who are currently 16th in the Premier League, in the final of the competition in Bilbao later this month where the consequences of winning and losing is huge for both clubs.",
      "If United fail to win they won't be in Europe next season and they will lose the added riches being in the Champions League will bring.",
      "And while United's status of being one of the biggest clubs and having one of the richest histories in world football remains a huge pull for players, not being in the Champions League could be a big problem when it comes to recruiting players of Cunha's ability - particularly if there is interest elsewhere.",
      "Certainly, that is the view held by Wolves legend Don Goodman.",
      "\"I wonder whether Matheus Cunha should have reservations about signing for Manchester United,\" Goodman told Boyle Sports.",
      "\"At this moment, if I were Matheus Cunha, I would be questioning whether it would be a good move right now joining Manchester United, who have a lot of ground to make up and rebuilding to do to get where he wants to be.",
      "\"So I’d understand if he had reservations about moving to Old Trafford. I think he's a top player who could play for any team in the Premier League or in Europe. That's how good I think he is.",
      "\"From his perspective, and I'm not dismissing the history and tradition of Manchester United, I'd be shocked if Matheus Cunha didn't have options to join better teams.",
      "\"I suppose Manchester United can still win the Europa League, which may change things, but Matheus Cunha will have to sit down and talk through all the offers he'll receive with his representatives when the season draws to a close.\"",
      "If United have a clear run at signing Cunha then it shouldn't become an issue. However, if the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle reignite their previous interest in the 25-year-old, and can offer him Champions League football, it will make life difficult for United if they fail to beat Spurs in Bilbao.",
      "Not only in the case of Cunha, but Delap has many suitors because of his relatively cheap £30m price tag. And it will apply to whoever else United target in the summer, too.",
      "While defeat in Bilbao won't be terminal for their transfer prospects, victory and the lure of Champions League football next season can only help them be successful in the transfer market."

But Pep Guardiola has managed to overcome such ridiculousness a couple of times and Manuel Pellegrini needed those six points to help deliver a title.",
      "",
      "Brighton – two times (in 2022/23 and 2024/25)\nNever before had Brighton completed a league double over Man Utd until they bookended an actually decent Ten Hag season with a pair of defeats, including Alexis Mac Allister’s 99th-minute winning penalty at the Amex. Then Fabian Hurzeler repeated the feat in just the worst campaign.",
      "",
      "Liverpool – two times (in 2013/14 and 2021/22)\nIt really should have been more, and indeed Liverpool will be frustrated to have completed more Premier League doubles in 21 attempts against Ferguson’s Man Utd than in 12 tries against the incompetent mess he left behind. Considering how generally excellent the Reds have been in that time it is especially curious that Jurgen Klopp could only do it as often as Brendan Rodgers – and that was against the risible combined efforts of Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick.",
      "",
      "West Ham – one time (in 2024/25)\nWhile many Hammers will still fondly remember the work of Alans Pardew and Curbishley in beating Man Utd 1-0 home and away to help secure Premier League safety in 2006/07, for many the double act of Julen and Graham will be the first taste of that particular double.

      "Newcastle – one time (in 2024/25)\nSo confident were Newcastle that the demons of Kevin Keegan could finally be exorcised that they trusted Jason Tindall to finish the job at St James’ Park. A swashbuckling 4-1 thrashing was about as dominant as the 2-0 victory the Magpies secured at Old Trafford a few months prior.

      "Spurs – one time (in 2024/25)\nIn an abysmal and very possibly sack-worthy domestic season for Ange Postecoglou, almost one-fifth of his total league wins have come against Man Utd.

The roles were recast for Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard 17 years later.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace – one time (in 2023/24)\nHaving never beaten Manchester United twice in a league season, Palace made it look mightily easy when they followed up 1-0 win at Old Trafford in September with a proper paddling at Selhurst Park the following April. That was the Casemiro “leave the football before the football leaves you” game; it was an absolute humiliation.",

      "Swansea – one time (in 2014/15)\nPerhaps the most surprising side to take advantage of this hilariously embarrassing era to register their first league double over a club which must technically be described as Man Utd was Swansea. Their highest-ever Premier League finish of 8th was at least in some part supported by a couple of 2-1 wins, with Ki Sung-yueng scoring in both. The great man is still playing, and even being captained by Jesse Lingard at FC Seoul, no less.",

      "Liverpool thanked them by securing a 3-0 win at Elland Road that set two unbroken top-flight records: most points in a top-flight season with two for a win (68); and fewest goals conceded in a 42-game campaign (16).",

      "",
      "Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nThe 2024/25 Player of the Year’s imperious form pushed Man City to their fourth-straight title, but he finds himself in the Premier League hall of shame for his awful defence of this crown.",
      "Last season, everything Foden touched turned to gold, but he has been rotten this term and his alarming decline has sparked internal ‘concerns’.",
      "Fatigue is likely a contributing factor as he risks being left behind during Thomas Tuchel’s England era and returning to the periphery at Man City, starting only 20 Premier League games this season.",
      "Still, Foden is *somehow* only 24 and has already racked up over 300 appearances for his boyhood club, so hitting a brick wall is understandable.",
      "He can be forgiven for having a season off, as long as he returns to form next season. For a player of his immense ability, it is surely only a matter of time before this happens and Kevin De Bruyne’s exit gives him the opportunity to finally become Man City’s main man.",

      "The jury is out on whether Guardiola has the necessary appetite for the huge rebuild at the Etihad, but he is boosted by Man City’s academy churning out a seemingly endless stream of gifted footballers.",
      "Lewis is one such example as he’s previously displayed the appropriate level of footballing intelligence to fill various roles in Guardiola’s fluid system. But this season has been chastising for the 20-year-old, with his head coach resorting to playing Matheus Nunes right-back over him following Kyle Walker’s exit.",
      "Lewis is far from the finished article and still needs to develop physically, but unless City buy a new right-back, he remains the obvious long-term option – and more experience should help him win back Guardiola’s trust.",
      "",
      "Mason Mount (Manchester United)\nA semblance of respite has been long overdue for injury-ravaged Mount, who has barely had an opportunity to get his Man Utd career started since his £60m move from Chelsea in 2023.",
      "The Man Utd transfer curse is severe and it’s even struck Mount, who was seen as a safe signing thanks to his domestic and European pedigree.",
      "Up to now, Mount’s spell at Man Utd has been disastrous and it could end his time as a midfielder at the top level, but Thursday night felt significant as two stunning goals finally gave the damaged star something to smile about.",

      "The Norway international has gone from being one of the Premier League’s most creative players to an ineffective midfielder offering very little, but he’s perhaps been a victim of Arsenal lacking a clinical edge ahead of him, while his and Bukayo Saka’s injuries also seem to have dampened his spirits.",
      "The upcoming transfer window is promising to be the ‘biggest of a generation’, with the focus on bolstering the striking and wide areas. Odegaard should only benefit from having more high-quality teammates to link up with.",

      "Cole Palmer (Chelsea)\nCold Cole has become lukewarm after being one of the only credible challengers to Mohamed Salah in the race for the POTS award in the early months of this season, with his 12-game Premier League goal drought leading to justified calls for the England international to be dropped.",
      "In a remarkable debut season, Palmer emphatically bucked the trend of Todd Boehly-era Chelsea signings to swiftly become the big fish in a “toxic” pond, but he’s been dragged down by his inferior teammates this term as a dip in confidence has made him seem ordinary.",
      "His goalless spell ended against Liverpool to cap off a great performance as he returned to being at the forefront of everything positive from Chelsea in the attacking half, albeit against the off-the-ball champions.",

      "Andy Robertson (Liverpool)\nArne Slot has done very little wrong in his debut season at Anfield, getting more out of Jurgen Klopp’s squad than Liverpool’s beloved former boss, but there have been a few exceptions and Robertson has struggled.",
      "It’s been disheartening to see the once-great Robertson look past it this season as the years of breathless running under Klopp catch up with him.",
      "From indispensable to a weak link, Robertson has been a shadow of his former self this season and it’s no surprise that the signing of a new left-back is a priority for Liverpool, with Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez mooted as a top target.",

      "Luke Shaw (Manchester United)\nShaw’s last two seasons have mirrored Mount’s, with the full-back only making 14 Premier League starts since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "When Shaw was last fully fit for a sustained spell, he was arguably the best left-back in the Premier League, but injuries have seriously damaged his career and kept him from consistently hitting the heights he once promised as a teenager.",
      "Shaw has been eased back into the fold in recent weeks and, like Mount, he could be a hugely important player for Amorim. Shaw can be a natural wing-back who can contribute in each half, or a solid left centre-back option, if he can stay fit for a sustained period.",
      "",

      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "United and Spurs sit 15th and 16th in the Premier League respectively having endured miserable domestic campaigns, but having both cruised through their respective Europa League semi-finals, one of them will be competing in the Champions League next season.",
      "Speaking to beIN Sports, Wenger claimed the Europa League winners should be rewarded with a place back in the same competition and said the rule was particularly unfair for English clubs.",
      "“No – they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League,” Wenger said.",

      "Neville insists the glory of winning the Europa League has been diminished, with United in particular far more focused on Champions League qualification than the trophy itself, with the financial implications massive for securing a place in Europe’s showcase competition next term.",
      "“I do actually agree a little bit with Arsene Wenger,” Neville said. “Every game we watch at the minute we just talk about the money at stakes. No one is talking about winning the Europa League to win a trophy.",
      "“UEFA Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup used to be big trophies that club could win. Now, the first thing you hear is ‘yeah you get the Champions League, it’s a £60m game’. The FA Cup has become devalued, really great competitions have become devalued.”",

      "He said: “I agree with that. I think it’s spot on. To have five or six teams.. It’s called a Champions League.",

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Manchester United secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils had a 3-0 lead going into the second leg but it was a tense atmosphere for much of the second leg after Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half strike gave Athletic Club hope of a comeback.",
      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Paul Scholes picks Europa League winner as Man Utd face Tottenham in final – ‘It’s like Real Madrid’\n👉 Man Utd, Spurs set up comedic Europa League final… and they somehow totally deserve it\n👉 Ornstein names 22 ‘available’ players this summer as Man Utd quartet expected to leave",
      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",
      "“Lovely. It was very nice to score a scrappy goal. I am very glad Amad played the ball. What a player. Great player to have back in the team. Them two players are extremely talented, so we are very glad to have them both back [Amad and Mount].”",
      "Ruben Amorim admits he is “embarrassed’ to be Manchester United manager in their worst season in Premier League history.",
      "Paul Scholes has hit out at Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim over a “madness” which he “might regret” and leaves a “bad taste in the mouth”.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has performed an ‘incredible U-turn’ on one Manchester United star who could ‘see out his career’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United should be celebrating reaching a Europa League final, but Ruben Amorim was ‘forced’ to wear a plaster ‘just months’ after getting angry.",
      "Ruben Amorim has responded to Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal legend called for a rule change which would impact Manchester United."

      "Garnacho started the second leg of United’s Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club but was hooked on the hour mark with the Red Devils trailing 1-0 on the night, before a brilliant brace from Mason Mount and goals from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund saw them storm back and claim a 7-1 aggregate win to set up a final with Tottenham.",
      "The 20-year-old has struggled through much of this campaign as he’s struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s system, which sees him play a more central role in a 3-4-3 formation.",
      "He’s been heavily linked with an exit as a result and United are thought to be ready to listen to offers of £65m for the Argentina international, with Chelsea among those most interested in signing him.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "Fellow former United midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: “I think he’s really special and he’s a man for the big moments. He can deal with the pressure at this club.",
      "“The problem is Ruben Amorim’s system suits No. 10s but he’s better on the wings running at people, he’s probably United’s best player at that.",
      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "If you take the three relegated clubs out of the equation, Manchester United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games. They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and the top-flight is so great otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals.",
      "West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing. United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",

      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",

      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",
      "The three points moves West Ham above Man Utd into 15th. Meanwhile, United, who have now suffered back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford, are without a league win since March 16.",

You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",
      "\"It's something we need to work on. It's inside the pitch and outside the pitch. If we are not able to do, we have to go away and give the space to different people. All of us.",
      "\"We are going to face a team from Premier League so we are going to struggle. Of course we are going to be more focused, and that is a concern because we have to be focused every game.",
      "\"For me, it doesn't matter if we win the Europa League because the problems are much bigger than that.\"",
      "Manchester United suffered their ninth home Premier League defeat of the season, their joint-most ever home losses in a single league campaign, along with 1930/31, 1933/34, and 1962/63.",
      "United have fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024/25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most ever in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023/24.",
      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two.",
      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",
      "You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could improve greatly next season.",
      "West Ham goalscorer Tomas Soucek:",
      "\"It's always great. I'm so proud of how we played. Last week we played in a similar style and we wanted to show how much we want to play for West Ham. We got three points today and I thought it was fully deserved.",
      "\"We were all together and fought for every ball. We had great pressing. When someone went to press others helped him. When somebody lost the ball, we didn't turn our backs.",
      "\"One of my goals is I want to be in the right place at the right moment.",
      "\"Three days ago my wife gave birth to my son so I scored the goal for him.",
      "\"For us and a new manager it's so important to get three points.\""

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",

      "Report as two goals from Mason Mount saw Man Utd come from a goal down on the night to beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final at Old Trafford; United will play Tottenham in Bilbao",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 06:09, UK",
      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",
      "The result sets up an all-English final in Bilbao on May 21 following Tottenham's win over Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final. A difficult season for both Premier League clubs will end with one of them securing a Champions League spot next season.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (5), Lindelof (5), Maguire (5), Yoro (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (8), Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Garnacho (5), Fernandes (7), Hojlund (6).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (9), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Amass (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nAthletic Club: Agirrezabala (5), Gorosabel (6), Yeray Alvarez (6), Unai Nunez (6), Berechiche (6), Ruiz De Galarreta (6), Jaureguizar (7), Alvaro Djalo (6), Gomez (7), Berenguer (7), Sannadi (6).\n\n\nSubs:De Marcos (5), Prados (n/a), Olabarrieta (5), Guruzeta (5), Vesga Arruti (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Mason Mount.",
      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable. For me personally, my first goals at Old Trafford. Special night, one I have been waiting a long time for. We want to go to Bilbao and finish strong now.\"",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Man Utd beat Athletic Club 7-1 on aggregate in their Europa League semi-final to book their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21; Mason Mount scored twice, becoming the first United substitute to do so in a European knockout game since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
