      "Marseille manager Roberto de Zerbi has declared that former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood possesses the talent to one day claim the Ballon d'Or. The striker departed Old Trafford in a £26.6million transfer to Marseille in July 2024.",
      "The 23-year-old went on to net 22 goals and provide six assists in all competitions during his first campaign with the French Ligue 1 side. Greenwood has not played for United since January 2022, after an internal club investigation led to the conclusion that he wouldn't play for them again following charges of attempted rape, coercive control and assault brought in early 2022.",
      "The charges were subsequently dropped in February 2023, with Greenwood firmly denying all accusations. The academy product has bagged 13 goals across all competitions this term - including three in the Champions League.",
      "Speaking to journalists on Friday before Marseille's fixture against Monaco, De Zerbi expressed his belief that Greenwood has what it takes to win football's most prestigious individual honour.",
      "He said: \"I see him every day, he has huge potential. I don't see any other players in Europe at the same level.",
      "\"He has the potential to win the Ballon d'Or. It will be up to him to decide whether he wants to do everything he can to fight for it or not.",
      "\"At the level of the qualities that nature has given him, that his parents have given him, I think he is worthy of the Ballon d'Or.",
      "\"I would like him to be more consistent. I know he needs to press with more intensity, he needs to manage the ball better when the team is in trouble, not lose the ball easily but keep it to allow the team to move up because he has the ability to do it.\"",
      "Greenwood, who has earned one England cap, changed his international allegiance to Jamaica earlier this year.",
      "In August, he obtained his passport for the Caribbean nation, paving the way for him to play for his grandparents' country.",
      "That choice may now feel more straightforward following Thomas Tuchel's dismissal of any prospect of an England comeback.",
      "\"I have not spoken to him until now,\" he said in September.",
      "\"I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought.",
      "\"He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim STILL remains in the dark over whether Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be available to take on Bournemouth on Monday as Manchester United await clarity on when they must depart for their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duties. FIFA recently set December 15 as the release date for players participating in the tournament, but with United scheduled to play Bournemouth that same evening, it has created uncertainty over whether the trio will feature against the Cherries.",
      "Just three days before kick-off, Amorim still doesn't know if he can rely on those players for the Bournemouth clash and has been compelled to prepare multiple tactical approaches for the match, based on their potential availability. He's optimistic that the confusion might also unsettle Bournemouth, who cannot prepare for which United side they'll encounter.",
      "\"We are still in conversations with national teams, the game is Monday, they are training and we are trying to prepare all scenarios,\" he explained. \"It's frustrating, but at the same time, nobody knows who is going to play, so it's a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week you can work on several stuff to prepare the game.\"",
      "Mazraoui is set to kick off his AFCON campaign on the tournament's opening day (December 21), with Morocco facing Comoros, while Amad and Mbeumo won't see action until Christmas Eve when Ivory Coast take on Mozambique and Cameroon go up against Gabon.",
      "It was speculated that the release dates for the players could vary based on their tournament start dates, but Amorim stated that this wasn't certain and he hoped to have clarity by Saturday at the latest. \"I don't know if it's going to be the same situation,\" he commented.",
      "\"Every national team has their ideas about when they want the players. I expect today or maybe tomorrow to have a decision, but we are waiting until the last moment to choose the best team.\"",
      "United defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt remain absent for the game against Bournemouth. But striker Benjamin Sesko could play for the first time since sustaining a knee injury at Tottenham five weeks ago.",
      "“Maguire is out, De Ligt is out,” said Amorim. “Ben we have to see.",
      "“We have to see if he’s available. He had some (food) poisoning but we’ll see. Let’s wait. We have two training (sessions) still. Benjamin we will assess.",
      "“(De Ligt) has something in his back. I don’t know for sure. Sometimes you see it’s not a big injury because he finished the game quite well against Crystal Palace, but he has some pain.",
      "“So, you sometimes think that it’s going to solve during this week but sometimes he feels a little bit of pain and we have to be careful with that.”",

      "Jadon Sancho appeared visibly upset on Thursday night after being substituted during Aston Villa's 2-1 victory over FC Basel in the Europa League. The 25-year-old joined Villa on a season-long loan from Manchester United in the summer amid widespread speculation about his future.",
      "Since his move to Villa Park, the winger has only started five matches, with all seven of his Premier League appearances coming as a substitute. On Thursday night, Sancho was in the starting line-up for Unai Emery's side in Switzerland as they aimed to secure their spot in the last 16 of the Europa League.",
      "The United loanee has now started four matches in the competition for Villa, including their previous three victories against Maccabi Tel Aviv, Young Boys and Basel. However, Sancho seemed noticeably annoyed when he was substituted.",
      "With Villa leading 2-1 thanks to goals from Evann Guessand and Youri Tielemans, Emery decided to replace Sancho as part of a triple substitution. Amadou Onana and Emiliano Buendia were also taken off, with Boubacar Kamara, Morgan Rogers, and Ollie Watkins brought on.",
      "As the change was made, TV cameras captured Sancho approaching the substitutes' bench, clearly disappointed to be leaving the pitch. After acknowledging Emery, Sancho hit an empty seat in the dugout before taking his place on the bench.",
      "Despite his frustration, Sancho put in a solid performance on Thursday night and was unlucky not to provide an assist for Guessand. This follows speculation that Villa remain uncertain about Sancho and his long-term prospects at the club.",
      "Sancho's United contract is due to run out at the season's end. It is currently unclear what the future holds for the ex-Borussia Dortmund star",
      "Earlier this year, Villa struck a deal worth £10.5million with Gremio for Brazilian winger Alysson. A medical is scheduled before a January transfer, with the left-footed right winger bringing additional options to Emery's attacking ranks.",
      "Previously, reports suggested Villa were already contemplating making Sancho's switch permanent, but his limited game time in the Midlands plus Alysson's arrival has cast doubt on that possibility. \"When Leon Bailey left, it was a moment for us to assess the players we had identified through our scouting,\" Emery explained when questioned about the decision to recruit the winger.",
      "\"We then had the opportunity to make a signing, and one of the players on our list was Jadon Sancho. He's capable of playing on both the right and left wings, and he provides something different. He's a good player - 25 years old - and I felt he performed very well last year at Chelsea.",
      "\"Yes, he had some problems at Manchester United, but during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. He's also played 25 times for England. He's still young, still hungry, and has the ability to show his skills and qualities.",
      "\"Hopefully, we can bring out the best in him here. In the last few years, he's played more on the left, but at Dortmund, he was more often on the right. Here, I see him being able to play in both of those positions.\"",

      "Manchester United cult hero Andrei Kanchelskis was welcomed back to the club for a tour of the Carrington facilities this week - and he looked completely different from his playing days.",
      "The Russian winger was hugely popular at Old Trafford, a key figure in helping the club end a 26-year wait for the league title, and is widely remembered for a famous hat-trick in a 5-0 win over rivals Manchester City in 1994.",
      "The club posted wholesome content of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season whilst on a tour of the facilities, a season in which he played a crucial part in achieving the domestic double.",
      "Kanchelskis was known for his explosive speed and agile dribbling; his slim, tall frame caused defenders’ nightmares throughout his time in the top flight.",
      "Now, nearly 20 years on from his playing career he still confidently boasts a full head of hair, albeit slightly more slicked back than the curtains he wore whilst in his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The tricky winger enjoyed an illustrious playing career, representing the Soviet Union and Russia at international level whilst playing for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division side Dynamo Bryansk and after his retirement, he took up the sporting director role at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before settling as a manager with various sides across central Europe.",
      "The Man United legend will be using his visit to England to gain inspiration and new ideas ahead of their domestic season kicking off in March.",
      "After enjoying a standout campaign for the Red Devils in 1994/95, winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, a shock move to Merseyside saw Kanchelskis join Everton for a club record £5 million fee and he has enjoyed somewhat of a cult status at both clubs since, a testament to his quality as a player.",
      "Kanchelskis and his son Andrei, who is a big supporter of Everton, also visited the Toffees’ training ground this week to meet David Moyes and to see their win over Nottingham Forest in the new stadium.",
      "When asked about his memories at the club, he said: “Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",
      "“He was always angry for me and (Giggsy) Ryan Giggs. But it was an excellent time and thank you very much Man United, it is still in my heart.”",
      "An early Christmas present from the club to one of their greats and a trip down memory lane for those who watched Kanchelskis play.",

      "Manchester United's Ayden Heaven is currently one of the most promising young talents at the club, having seen a swift rise since his transfer from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "The youngster had stints at both West Ham and Arsenal's youth academies before making the move to United for a nominal fee in February. Upon joining, Heaven inked a four-and-a-half-year contract with the Red Devils and was immediately integrated into the first-team squad.",
      "Since his arrival, the 19-year-old has made 11 appearances for United, notching up one assist in the Premier League victory over Brighton in October. Heaven has started two Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim this season, including the recent 4-1 triumph over Wolves, where he lined up in a back three alongside Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Heaven is the second highly-rated youngster to make the move from Arsenal to United within four-month time frame, with forward Chido Obi-Martin also making the switch, albeit to United's academy, toward the end of 2024. However, there was a clear reason why Arsenal were willing to let go of such a promising prospect, and it boils down to another rising star in their academy.",
      "During the midweek Champions League victory over Club Brugge, Salmon was brought on from the bench as Mikel Arteta faced a shortage of defensive options amid a mounting injury crisis. The report highlights that Heaven's switch to United was internally accepted at the Emirates due to the strong faith they have in Salmon's abilities.",
      "Following the Wolves victory, having appeared in consecutive league matches, Heaven reflected post-match: \"There's so many great defenders at this club that he's trusting you to be at the middle of that defence.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is trusting me a lot. I feel like I'm working hard every day in training and I'm showing he can trust me in the games that I'm playing.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been consistently linked with joining Napoli due to his limited game time at United. The 20-year-old midfielder saw a loan request rejected in the summer but has yet to start a league game this term.",
      "Napoli have Mainoo’s former teammate Scott McTominay and current United loanee Rasmus Hojlund within their squad. The Italian club’s sporting director Giovanni Manna has responded to speculation that Mainoo could be the next player to join from Old Trafford as Napoli battle an injury crisis.",

      "Manchester United have announced a £13.3million operating profit in their first quarter financial results. Last year, the club had built up a £6.9m loss over the same period.",
      "The financial change is due to reduced costs, following Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s financial review after purchasing a minority stake in 2024.

The latest figures show United’s total revenue was £140.3m, despite their absence from European competition this season.",

      "Marcus Rashford has admitted he only ever wanted to play for Manchester United as a child, but is now appreciative of the new experiences Barcelona is bringing him. Rashford joined Barca on a season-long loan in July after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim at United and is enjoying life at a new club.",
      "The England striker was placed in the ‘bomb squad’ at United alongside fellow unwanted players Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho. He was the first player to secure a move elsewhere, landing on his feet at Barca, the club he had angled for all summer.",
      "The 28-year-old has settled well in Hansi Flick’s side, contributing six goals and 11 assists in 21 games so far. Barcelona have the option of making the move permanent for €35million (£30.3m) and, having fallen out with Amorim, Rashford has made it clear he would like that to become a reality.",
      "His mindset was shown in an answer during an interview with BBC Sport. Asked whether he would’ve thought when he was younger that he’d have played for two big clubs like United and Barca, he replied: “It’s crazy. My dream when I was young was to just play for United. And then you don’t know what’s going to happen in your life.",
      "“I feel very lucky and fortunate that this is one of the places that I’ve been able to play for. Because it’s a huge club, a club I’ve always admired as a young boy – my favourite club outside of England. It’s amazing football that they play here, like lots of football fans know. To be able to wear this shirt is a tremendous feeling.”",
      "Rashford spoke in glowing terms about his new home in Catalonia, where he is learning Spanish and trying to throw himself into the culture. “It's different, but it's a great learning curve for me,” he said.",
      "“And even little things, I've not done it completely yet, but learning the language and stuff like that, learning the culture, it's all enjoyable for me.”",
      "He added: “It's a new language of football. I've always been, like many people in the world, an admirer of Spanish football. To play for the biggest club in Spain is a huge honour. I'm looking forward to playing more games here, just doing my best and try to help the team to win.”",
      "Rashford has been thriving on the pressure attached to playing for Barcelona. He came off the bench and provided an assist for Jules Kounde in the 2-1 comeback win over Frankfurt on Tuesday, earning rave reviews from the Spanish media. Barca are four points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and are favourites for the title following five straight league wins.",

      "United have been prioritising youth recruitment under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership. Last season they brought in Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi from Arsenal's academy, while a reluctance to bring in Sergio Ramos suggests high-earning players over the age of 30 are a thing of the past.",
      "\"From ELA ➝ Signing for one of the biggest club in the world,\" wrote West London-based youth football organisation Elite London Academy. \"Today we congratulate Socrates on officially signing for Manchester United. @manutd",

      "\"Along his journey, we organised trials for him at Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace. He completed full trials at these clubs but these did not result in registration. Arguably, missed opportunities for the clubs. But what makes Socrates different is how he responded. He didn’t sulk. He didn’t lose confidence. He showed resilience, maturity and a mindset far beyond his age.\"",
      "According to ELA's post, Socrates started out as a winger but now plays as a left-sided centre-back. He is said to have turned down a deal at another club because of the school opportunity offered, and is said to be continuing his education at \"a highly academic and selective school\" in Manchester.",
      "\"Off the pitch, he’s exactly the type of boy every academy wants: Humble, well-mannered, intelligent, respectful and driven,\" the academy added. \"And behind him is a family who supports him in all the right ways — patient, positive, and trusting the process.\"",
      "United have also been showing their academy talents that there is a pathway to the first team. Heaven and Obi have both played for the senior side under head coach Ruben Amorim, while others - including 15-year-old prodigy JJ Gabriel - have trained with Amorim's squad while waiting for that first opportunity.",
      "Gabriel, who has 10 goals in 11 games for United's Under-18s, became the club's youngest ever FA Youth Cup scorer this week. His goal against Peterborough proved to be the winner and showed why United are so intent on keeping him at the club amid reports of transfer interest from Barcelona.",

      "Manchester United will face some significant transfer decisions in the January window, with a handful of players dealing with uncertain futures at the club.",
      "The Red Devils had a busy summer with several high-profile arrivals, including Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Despite these additions, Ruben Amorim's side have endured a mixed start to the campaign, sitting just outside the top six with seven wins from their 15 Premier League games so far.",
      "Some players have featured more regularly than others, and both Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were among those tipped to depart in the summer but ultimately stayed put. Now, as the January window approaches, speculation surrounding their futures has resurfaced once again.",
      "The pair are relatively high earners within the squad, with Capology claiming Zirkzee earns in the region of £5.5million per year. Mainoo, meanwhile, is said to earn roughly £1.3million annually.",
      "However, the article also states that Zirkzee himself is determined to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford. He has made a greater impact in recent weeks, including scoring an equaliser against Crystal Palace at the end of last month before United went on to win the game 2-1.",
      "As for Mainoo, his future appears to be leaning away from the Manchester club and towards a move abroad. The young midfielder had been linked with a switch to Serie A champions Napoli in the summer before the deal was reportedly blocked by United.",
      "The latest update from the Daily Mail says clubs are willing to sign Mainoo on loan in January if United are now open to a deal. The report also adds that Napoli remains the player's preference after his initial request to join them was rejected.",
      "It has been claimed the final decision will rest with United's hierarchy, led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. Amorim will also have a say, though the Red Devils are expected to target a replacement if any departure is sanctioned.",
      "The United boss made his stance on January exits clear at the end of last month, noting he will not push either player towards the exit door. Instead, Amorim will make decisions based on what is best for the football club as a whole.",
      "\"The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen,\" the Portuguese coach explained in a press conference a few weeks ago. \"I was a football player, I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation, so I don't know what is going to happen.\"",

      "The BBC has revealed why former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay was overlooked for the Sports Personality of the Year award, explaining that an expert panel came to a collective agreement on the final shortlist. The 29-year-old has emerged as one of Europe's most impressive performers following his switch to Napoli last summer.",
      "McTominay netted 12 goals for Antonio Conte's team as they claimed the Serie A crown, smashing Denis Law's 63-year-old scoring record and earning Serie A Player of the Season honours for the previous campaign. He made history as the first Scottish player to claim the prize at the Gran Galà del Calcio ceremony this month.",
      "The 29-year-old played a crucial role in Scotland's World Cup qualification and secured 18th place on the Ballon d'Or shortlist, becoming the first Scot to feature since Ally McCoist in 1987.",
      "Despite his remarkable displays, the BBC has excluded McTominay from their final shortlist for this year's Sports Personality of the Year honour.",
      "When pressed for a comprehensive explanation regarding McTominay's omission, a BBC representative informed the Scottish Express: \"A wide range of contenders were reviewed and debated by an expert industry panel, who reached a consensus on the final shortlist.\"",
      "The United academy product was the hero as Scotland overcame Denmark to secure World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998, with his spectacular strike earning calls for a Puskas Award nomination. Luke Littler and Rory McIlroy have both secured spots on the final shortlist following extraordinary campaigns in their respective disciplines.",
      "England Lionesses stars Hannah Hampton and Chloe Kelly, rugby union ace Ellie Kildunne and Formula 1 world champion Lando Norris complete the remaining nominees.",
      "Sports journalist Henry Winter raised eyebrows over Scott McTominay's absence from the lineup, posting on social media: \"Scott McTominay a surprise omission from #SPOTY short-list?\".",
      "\"Won Scudetto, voted Serie A Player of the Year, nominated for Ballon d'Or, helped Scotland qualify for World Cup, scored vital/spectacular goal against Denmark that's surely a Puskas Awards contender. Amazing year.\"",
      "The final selection hasn't gone down well with everyone, as numerous supporters responded with 'great point' whilst branding his exclusion as 'harsh'. One supporter commented: \"It's terrible but not surprising,\" whilst another chimed in: \"It is a farce.\"",
      "A third remarked: \"I agree, what an outstanding year he's had, he should have been included in the SPOTY shortlist,\" whilst another suggested: \"Unsure why they need to limit the list? I'd [say] there are others that deserve the recognition, McTominay a case in point, then expand the list. All of the nominees deserve to be there, so [there] should be more to choose from. Lando or Luke to win for me, but that's my preference.\"",
      "Following the announcement of the shortlist, Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: \"This has been a breath-taking year for sport, driven by athletes whose performances belong in the history books.",
      "\"Each one has delivered moments of pure brilliance that have defined 2025. It's been incredible to watch, and I can't wait to honour their achievements, and to see who the nation chooses as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025.\"",
      "Teenage sensation Littler, just 18, clinched the world number one spot in darts and is now gearing up to defend his World Championship crown, whilst McIlroy etched his name into golfing folklore as only the sixth player ever to secure a grand slam across all four major tournaments.",
      "The Northern Irishman ultimately triumphed at Augusta before playing a pivotal role in Europe's nail-biting Ryder Cup triumph against the Americans. Meanwhile, Hampton and Kelly both shone brightly as England successfully defended their European Championship title.",
      "Kildunne emerged as one of England's most dazzling talents, bagging five tries as the Red Roses captured the Women's Rugby World Cup on home turf.",
      "Norris joined an elite group as the 11th British driver to claim a Formula 1 world championship, securing the title with a third-place finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.",

      "Spain legend Sergio Ramos has been linked with a shock move to Manchester United after leaving Mexico side Monterrey. It isn't the first time the 39-year-old has been mentioned in connection with an Old Trafford switch, though the latest rumours appear wide of the mark.",
      "Ramos returned to boyhood club Sevilla in 2023 after spells with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, but lasted just one season. He moved to Mexico for Monterrey's 2025 campaign, playing at the Club World Cup, but has left this month after not extending his contract.",
      "If Ramos is to prolong his career, it's unclear where the next chapter will take place. According to ESPN, United remain focused on signing younger players and have not held any talks over a move for the veteran.",
      "It was a different story a decade ago, though. Back then, the Red Devils were serious about a move for Ramos, and he would later shed light on how close he was to making the jump to the Premier League.",
      "\"I stayed where I should have stayed, Real Madrid, but I was indeed close to playing for United,\" Ramos said in 2023. He was speaking just months after returning to Sevilla and recognised his career could have ended up taking a different path.",
      "\"It was not to be, but I do keep that admiration for the club, to the Premier League and the players, because the rhythm of play, the pace is different, and it's a league we can all learn a great deal from, all of us,\" he added. \"So that was not meant to be. I was glad to stay in Madrid, and now I'm glad to be in Sevilla.\"",
      "Wherever Ramos ends up next, he leaves Monterrey after sharing an emotional farewell message. \"Saying goodbye is never easy,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"It ends a stage that started full of excitement in February and that has allowed me to discover a country, a city, a football... and that leaves me many new experiences and, above all, many friends.",
      "\"I will forever be proud to have worn the Rayados captain bracelet, to have led the team in the first Club World Cup in its new format, to have battled in the Closure, in the Opening, in the Leagues Cup, in the Concacaf Champions Cup... and to have bravely defended the Steel Giant by your side in all the matches we have played at home.",
      "\"Left it all on and off the court so I can perform at my best. 34 games, more than 3,000 minutes, 8 goals and so many emotions that can't be described in numbers. To the club, to my dear colleagues, to the technical bodies, to the employees, to everyone, thank you. And above all, thank you, fans, who have brought me your warmth and affection from the first moment I stepped into the city. I will always remember with nostalgia this stage of my career and I will always proudly say 'Arriba el Monterrey!'\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt, Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire were nowhere to be seen during Manchester United's training session at Carrington on Thursday. With United set to face Bournemouth in the Premier League on Monday, Ruben Amorim is expected to provide clarity on team news at his pre-match press conference.",
      "Discussing De Ligt's injury following the Wolves match, Amorim remained cautious about his return: \"I don't know, sometimes you have an idea then you have to see day by day. I'm not going to say when he is coming back.\"",
      "The Dutch defender has been sidelined for the West Ham and Wolves fixtures due to his knock. While De Ligt wasn't involved in Thursday's training, he was present at Carrington fulfilling external media obligations.",
      "The Bournemouth fixture was initially targeted as a potential comeback date for Sesko following his injury against Tottenham on November 8. On November 21, Amorim offered an update, stating: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long, but it's not that serious. We have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Maguire sustained a hamstring injury during the 2-2 stalemate against Tottenham. Last week, Amorim confirmed the England defender was \"still out\" with the issue.",
      "The absence of senior players paved the way for Shea Lacey, Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson to participate in the training session. Lacey has been included in the last four Premier League matchday squads.",
      "Manager Amorim has suggested that academy players will play a crucial role when he loses Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations next week.",
      "Amorim stated: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Speaking about Lacey's progress, Amorim added: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

      "According to Omar Berrada, the Manchester United hierarchy is making “strong progress” in their “transformation of the club.” The chief executive officer bases this claim on first-quarter accounts which, he says, show “robust financial results”.",
      "To the layman, they do not seem overly ‘robust’, and financial types on social media were not exactly bowled over by the numbers. Neither was the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "There was an operating profit of £13.3million compared to a £6.9m loss in the first quarter of the last financial year, but that was mainly down to player sales, most notably somehow getting Chelsea to hand over £40m for Alejandro Garnacho. Chelsea have come to the rescue of a few clubs when it comes to balancing the books. Ask Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "But Manchester United should not be a club that relies heavily on player sales. The figures might be robust but there is no doubt a lack of European football will have an impact on this year’s numbers.",
      "The total revenue for the quarter - £140.3m, which is slightly down, year on year - still shows the financial strength of the club. That is still a projected annual revenue of around £650m. They are still big numbers. But what will jar with supporters is the club’s net debt, now at a record high of £749.2m.",
      "And what will grate even more is that the original £481m debt from the Glazers’ leveraged takeover is still there. It is has not been reduced.",
      "A financial and footballing powerhouse such as United can shoulder such debt but the fact the Glazers have since taken out tens and tens of millions of pounds in dividends and share sales is an insult to supporters. According to the renowned football finance expert Kieran Maguire, since the Glazers took over in 2005, the accumulated pre-tax losses total £531m and the cumulative net interest costs are in excess of £1bn.",
      "But the Glazers have been ok, don’t worry about that. Perhaps they will start paying themselves dividends again, now there is a profit on the table.",
      "And that would cheer up those long-serving office staff who have been culled by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those left who have had their free lunches taken away. But for all the debt and the bad taste left by Sir Jim’s ruthless cost-cutting, the figures do again show that United remain a financial and commercial powerhouse in European football.",
      "They just need to re-establish themselves as a powerhouse on the field of play. They just need to get back to the top table, to Premier League and Champions League contention.",
      "Berrada says a ‘sustainably lower cost base’ and ‘a more streamlined, effective organisation’ has helped the club “invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.” As if that is some sort of boast.",
      "But while this latest financial announcement is unlikely to turn heads on or off the pitch, it does once again show that if Ruben Amorim can work the miracle, United can become a perennial force once again. That, though, is a very big 'if'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker have made it clear Mason Greenwood should not try and make a comeback to England. The 24-year-old netted twice in Marseille's 3-2 win against Union Saint-Gilloise in the Champions League.",
      "Back in November, reports emerged suggesting Greenwood harboured ambitions of re-joining the England setup, having turned down a call-up from Jamaica's national side. Three months earlier, he'd obtained Jamaican citizenship and a passport, but his refusal to answer the Reggae Boyz's call hints he's still holding out for a Three Lions return.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel has already made it clear he won't be selecting Greenwood. Assessing his situation, Shearer and Lineker believe the right decision for Greenwood is to carry on plying his trade overseas and turn out for Jamaica instead.",
      "On the Rest is Football podcast, Lineker said: \"I want to talk about Mason Greenwood. He's been doing brilliantly since. I know there's a lot of controversy around him and he had that awfulness of his situation.",
      "\"He's gone abroad and he's performing, as he did last season, but this season at Marseille he's performing really well. Another two goals yesterday, excellent finishes.\"",
      "Lineker added: \"I think he's decided he is not going to try and play for England and that he is going to play for Jamaica, which is another option for him. Do you think that makes sense? It would be difficult for him here wouldn't it?\"",
      "Shearer replied: \"I think it was the right decision for him to go to another country. He had to settle down and just try and go out and play football.",
      "\"I don't think anybody ever questioned his ability. He was a very good football player with a lot of talent. I think we all knew that.\"",
      "Greenwood's international career with England was limited to just one cap, earned in 2020 during a UEFA Nations League fixture against Iceland.",
      "That same international break saw him and Phil Foden disciplined and sent home after both players allegedly breached Icelandic Coronavirus restrictions by meeting two women in a separate area of the Three Lions' hotel.",
      "Both footballers were required to apologise, with then England boss Gareth Southgate labelling them as \"naive.\"",
      "Whilst Greenwood received a call-up for England's Euro 2020 squad, an injury shortly before the tournament ruled him out of the competition.",
      "This season, Greenwood has netted 13 goals and provided four assists in 20 appearances across all competitions for the French club. He recently gave his first interview since leaving United, where he praised his manager Roberto De Zerbi, the ex-Brighton and Hove Albion chief who now manages Marseille.",
      "Greenwood told Telefoot: \"I'm in a really good place thanks to the coach and my team-mates. I feel good and I hope to improve, to win more awards this season.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay endured a difficult reunion with Jose Mourinho on Wednesday night. The Napoli star watched his team suffer a 2-0 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon, dealing a significant blow to the Italian side's Champions League hopes.",
      "Since departing Old Trafford in 2024, McTominay has been one of Antonio Conte's most impressive performers. Yet he struggled to replicate his typical form as the reigning Serie A champions suffered their third successive European away defeat.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte criticised the short recovery time following his team's victory over Juventus on Sunday, pointing out that Benfica had enjoyed an extra two days' rest. However, Mourinho dismissed Conte's argument after the final whistle.",
      "\"Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,\" he said. \"We interpreted the game well, I decided to play Ivanovic rather than Pavlidis upfront and that changed the way we attack.\"",
      "Mourinho added: \"The players showed character and intelligence, a Benfica mentality, which means when you are having the biggest difficulty, you step up. We knew that without a win here, we were out, but now that we have six points, we're in the running.\"",
      "The outcome leaves Napoli 23rd, narrowly within the play-off places, while Benfica trail by a point. Italian media have offered their verdicts on McTominay's display against his former United manager.",
      "Italian publication Gazzetta dello Sport detailed how McTominay had contributed to both of Benfica's goals. Richard Rios' opener resulted from a rebound involving McTominay and Benfica striker Ivanovic, while he also failed to track his man before Leandro Barreiro made it 2-0.",
      "The Scotland international was \"constantly forced to chase\" as part of a weary Napoli side, who were \"exhausted, lacking pace and ideas\". The criticism was partly attributed to the team's demanding fixture list.",
      "However, the match report delivered a scathing assessment of McTominay and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund's display: \"So McTominay, usually the driving force, is his own double, and Hojlund, the Old Lady's killer, is never seen.\"",
      "The match report from Corriere dello Sport also emphasised McTominay's defensive frailties during the match. It read: \"The protagonist is accustomed to being on the cover, but for different reasons.\"",
      "It was noted that the former United midfielder \"timidly leaps into the box, without rising with his usual vehemence and physical prowess\", before being involved in Rios' opening goal. For the second strike, McTominay was \"chasing\" Rios before his assist doubled the scoreline.",
      "Summarising Napoli's lacklustre showing, the match report said: \"Batteries were too low, there was little will to fight, and there was little hunger.\"",
      "Regarding McTominay's impact, Corriere dello Sport stated that \"the Scotsman was never seen, nor was Napoli\".",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim will surely be delighted by Mason Mount's Manchester United resurgence after a troublesome start to his Old Trafford career. The midfielder has been in hot goal-scoring form with two goals in his last three games with United rising to sixth in the Premier League following their 4-1 win against Wolves.",
      "Amorim was full of praise for the Englishman after his performance at the Molineux, saying: \"He can defend, he can attack, is really the quality that when he touched the ball is really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him.\"",
      "It's been quite the career resurgence for Mason Mount after an injury-plagued first two seasons at Old Trafford. The ex-Chelsea star, who cost United £60m in the summer of 2023, had made just 31 league appearances for the Red Devils prior to the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "But Mount has sent a clear message to his boss that he is over the hump when it comes to injuries and ready to be a regular starter as he finds a way to start paying back his price tag.",
      "The 26-year-old is once again adding goals to his game, having found the net three times in his last four league starts.",
      "Most recently netting in United's 4-1 rout of Wolves on Monday, Mount's growing importance to the team spells for surprising reading. In the seven league games he's started this season, United have won five of them while drawing and losing one each.",
      "Compared to the six games where he was used as a substitute, United won just two, drawn three and lost one. United are earning 2.3 points per game when Mount starts which would see the club hypothetically top of the table with 34 points if he had started all 15 matches.",
      "A repeat of Manchester United's 2023 pre-season clash against Wrexham could be on the cards for next summer. According to Mail Sport, the two clubs have had discussions about a potential match in Europe.",
      "Should an agreement on the friendly come to fruition, it is expected to take place to be in Scandinavia due to the mass popularity both clubs have in that region. Nothing has yet to be confirmed due to the clubs having to navigate their pre-season schedules around the World Cup next year which is being hosted in North America.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Their first clash was a feisty one which Wrexham ran out 3-1 winners against what was a youthful United side. Dan Gore was sent off in the second half while Paul Mullin suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs following a challenge from goalkeeper Nathan Bishop who issued an apology to the striker after the game.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel has smashed a Red Devils’ record amid speculation about his Old Trafford future. The 15-year-old has made quite the impression within the club’s youth ranks alongside Kai Rooney and Jacey Carrick.",
      "Barcelona have been credited with an interest in the youngster following an eye-catching start to the season. But it appears that Gabriel is remaining focused on his current role with United. The talented teenager was included in United’s side for their FA Youth Cup clash against Peterborough United and ended up being key to victory, scoring the only goal of the game.",
      "Gabriel's strike also means he is now the youngest-ever player to have scored in the FA Youth Cup at just 15 years of age. It also saw him extend a scintillating start to the campaign.",
      "Gabriel now has 11 goals in just 12 games, having also chalked up a hat-trick against Liverpool’s under-18s earlier this campaign. United have already been making a concerted effort to retain his services.",
      "Jason Wilcox wants to tie him down to a further two years at least, while Ruben Amorim has also held a meeting with the youngster. Speaking about Gabriel earlier this season, the United boss said: \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy.",
      "\"We try to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty and pace of our training.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Away from Amorim, Gabriel has also met former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Sharing a picture of the pair on Instagram, he wrote: “Great honour to meet legend Sir Alex Ferguson.”",
      "While United are keen to tie the youngster down to a new deal, he could potentially be set to link up with a fellow Red Devils academy graduate should he move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is currently in the middle of a loan spell at the Camp Nou, having fallen down the pecking order under Amorim.",
      "The forward has scored six goals and provided 11 assists so far in all competitions. Barcelona have an option in the agreement to sign the 28-year-old permanently for a fee of £26m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

FIFA recently confirmed December 15 as the release window for players involved in the competition, but with United in action against Bournemouth that evening, it led to some confusion as to whether the trio would be available to face the Cherries.",
      "Three days out from the game, Amorim still has no clue whether he can call on those players to face Bournemouth and he has been forced to draw up different plans for the fixture, depending on their availability. He is is hoping the uncertainty will also affect Bournemouth, who can't plan for which United team to face.",
      "\"We are still in conversations with national teams, the game is Monday, they are training and we are trying to prepare all scenarios,\" he said. \"It’s frustrating, but at the same time, nobody knows who is going to play, so it’s a good thing. We have players to cope with everything. With a long week you can work on several stuff to prepare the game.\"",
      "Mazraoui begins his AFCON campaign on the opening day of the tournament (December 21), with Morocco kicking off the competition against Comoros, but Amad and Mbeumo aren't in action until Christmas Eve, when the Ivory Coast play Mozambique and Cameroon face Gabon. It was thought that release dates for the players could differ depending on when they start the tournament, but Amorim said that wasn't clear and that he was hoping to hear by Saturday at the latest.",
      "\"I don't know if it’s going to be the same situation,\" he said. \"Every national team has their ideas about when they want the players. I expect today or maybe tomorrow to have a decision, but we are waiting until the last moment to choose the best team.\"",

      "The 2025/26 PDC World Darts Championship is now underway at London's Alexandra Palace, and reigning champion Luke Littler has made a winning start to his title defence.",
      "The Warrington-born title holder, who became the youngest-ever champion when he beat three-time winner Michael van Gerwen aged just 17 in last year’s final, secured passage into the second round with a 3-0 victory over Lithuania's Darius Labanauskas on the tournament's first night.",
      "Littler heads into the event, his third appearance at Ally Pally, on an impressive run of form, with recent victories at the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, Grand Slam, and Players Championship Finals securing his place as top seed and World Number One.",
      "He is joined at Alexandra Palace by former world champions, including Michael van Gerwen, Luke Humphries, and Gerwyn Price. Also in the mix this year are the likes of Stephen Bunting, Nathan Aspinall, James Wade, and Jonny Clayton, all part of the extended 128-player field.

      "One of the biggest storylines of the tournament is the potential for another classic showdown with rival Luke Humphries, the 2024 champion who is out for revenge after suffering a 16-11 loss to Littler in the Grand Slam of Darts final in November. A win for Humphries in this tournament would see him return to world number one, with this year's champion set to take home a whopping £1 million prize.",

      "Manchester United have reached an agreement with University Academy 92 (UA92) to expand their campus to Old Trafford. The first-of-its-kind agreement for Old Trafford means that several suites within the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand will be used as teaching spaces from January 2026.",
      "UA92 was founded by Gary Neville and his fellow Class of '92 members, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, and it provides courses in sport, business, digital and media. The agreement to expand UA92's campus to Old Trafford will provide students with the opportunity to learn within the stadium on non-matchdays. Manchester City's stadium, the Etihad, has been used as a campus for UFCB students, another university focusing on sports and wider sports industries.",
      "Neville said: “This is a full circle moment for me - Manchester United is where my dreams started and now we have the privilege of helping the next generation achieve theirs. Old Trafford has always been a place where young people dream big, and now it will also be a place where our students can learn, grow and build their futures. The Class of ’92’s experiences at Manchester United shaped who we are.",
      "\"The teamwork, commitment and belief we learned here are part of UA92’s DNA. Bringing our students into this environment connects everything we stand for — education, opportunity and the power of sport to change lives.\"",
      "Marc Armstrong, United's chief business officer, said: “We are really looking forward to opening the doors of Old Trafford to students from UA92. Manchester United has always been synonymous with youth, drive and determination, epitomised by the Class of ’92.",
      "“In the longer term, as we plan for the regeneration of the Old Trafford area, including the development of a new stadium, this agreement with UA92 demonstrates our desire to work together with local stakeholders in driving social and economic progress across Greater Manchester and beyond.”",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement. Andy Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but United have said they are \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "Marseille boss Roberto de Zerbi believes that former Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood could win the Ballon d'Or one day.",
      "The forward left Old Trafford permanently in a £26.6million deal to join Marseille in July 2024. The 23-year-old went on to score 22 goals alongside six assists across all competitions in his debut season for the French Ligue 1 team.",
      "Greenwood has not featured for United since January 2022, following an internal investigation by the club, which resulted in a decision that he would not continue to play for them after being charged with attempted rape, coercive control and assault in early 2022. Those charges were then dropped in February 2023, with Greenwood vehemently denying all allegations.",
      "The Reds academy graduate has scored 13 goals across all competitions so far this season - three of which have come in the Champions League.",
      "And De Zerbi has backed Greenwood to win the Ballon d'Or while speaking to the media on Friday ahead of Marseille's clash with Monaco.",
      "He said: \"I see him every day, he has huge potential. I don't see any other players in Europe at the same level.",
      "\"He has the potential to win the Ballon d'Or. It will be up to him to decide whether he wants to do everything he can to fight for it or not.",
      "\"At the level of the qualities that nature has given him, that his parents have given him, I think he is worthy of the Ballon d'Or.",
      "\"I would like him to be more consistent. I know he needs to press with more intensity, he needs to manage the ball better when the team is in trouble, not lose the ball easily but keep it to allow the team to move up because he has the ability to do it.\"",
      "Greenwood, who has one England cap, switched international allegiances to Jamaica earlier this year. In August, he received his passport for the Caribbean country, opening the door for him to represent the nation of his grandparents.",
      "And that decision may now be easier with Thomas Tuchel dismissing the idea of an England return. \"I have not spoken to him until now,\" he said in September.",
      "\"I have not spoken to him or his camp. My understanding was that he tries to play for Jamaica so we didn't give it another thought.",
      "\"He was not in the mix at the moment and he is not in our thoughts for our team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN's live blog, where you can get updates and the latest transfer news on Manchester United.",
      "Whether it is the uncertain future of academy starlet Kobbie Mainoo or other stars like Joshua Zirkzee, the MEN will be here with any and all updates emanating from Old Trafford. Mainoo's future continues to be an issue for the Reds, with the teenage prodigy falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim.",
      "He is still remembered for starting the Euro 2024 final when he was only 18 years old, so he still has a huge future in the beautiful game, even if it's not with United. However, with the January transfer window also on the horizon, there is also plenty of focus towards who the club could look to bring in this winter.",
      "Make yourself comfortable and stay tuned for all updates, reactions, analysis and opinions throughout the day.",
      "Man United and Chelsea have made an approach to sign Sunderland star Noah Sadiki in January.",
      "The report adds that United have approached Sadiki's representatives and view him as an alternative to Carlos Baleba.",
      "Ben Jacobs has claimed that Atletico Madrid are considering allowing Conor Gallagher to leave the club on loan in January.",
      "Man United have been interested in the midfielder for some time and his services could be acquired on a try before you buy move. “Man United see Conor Gallagher as a good ‘try before you buy’ option, if Atletico are open to a loan deal next month,\" the journalist said on The United Stand.",
      "Speculation has done the rounds this week that Man United are keen on signing Sergio Ramos. However, ESPN have claimed that it's not accurate.",
      "The defender left Monterrey this month following the expiry of hos contract but ESPN have claimed that United are not exploring a move.",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna appeared to pour cold water over the prospect of signing Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The Manchester United prodigy is out of favour with Ruben Amorim, who has insisted Mainoo will need to dislodge Bruno Fernandes if he is to start in his system. The Euro 2024 England star has since been linked with a move to Napoli, who have signed Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund from United in the last couple of years.",
      "However, speaking to Sky Italia, Manna appeared to suggest the Serie A reigning champions already have enough midfielders. He said: \"He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity.",
      "\"This team is doing well, it is consolidated. We have some important absences right now, but sooner or later the lads will return, strong and determined. We have to make the right evaluations, so we’ll see how things progress along the way.”",
      "Manchester United academy star Sam Mather is poised to leave the club in January. The 21-year-old looked set to join Turkish club Kayserispor in the summer, but a deal collapsed.",
      "Mather did have negotiations with UAE side Al Wahda FC in late September, but the Middle Eastern side pulled out after United demanded a buy-back clause. He recently scored twice against Norwich while playing with United's academy side.",
      "Manchester United cult hero Nani has urged the club to beat Liverpool to the signature of Antoine Semenyo. The Ghana international signed a new deal at Bournemouth until 2030.",
      "However, it's understood he can leave if a £65m bid is received before January 10. Nani believes he is worth the hefty price tag.",
      "The Portuguese ex-United star told the Metro: \"‘I think all the players who have the ability to move forward at speed, being able to dribble, able to shoot, to score goals, to assist and just have that general creativity in the moment would suit Manchester United.",
      "\"That’s the type of the player the fans want to see. However, we know that when players come to Man United, this is totally different. It’s a different environment, different pressure, different mentality, different job and, and then they have to adapt.",
      "\"I hope if we get Semenyo, he can come with his attitude, with this mentality and he can put all of his talent on the field and help the team.\"",
      "According to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Manchester United are contemplating dropping a £87.4m offer to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace.",
      "Casemiro, who has been impressive at times this season, is 33-years-old and United's main recurring weakness is energy and losing games in the middle of the park. It's claimed they are so desperate to fix this problem, they will try to snap up Wharton in the January transfer window.",
      "This will be a difficult move, given Palace's aspirations in the Premier League and Europa Conference League. Moreover, after spending the best part of £230m in the summer, it's unlikely United will have £87m to spend on one player in January.",
      "Manchester United are keeping an eye on Sunderland midfielder Noah Sadiki. The Congolese ace has been impressive for the Black Cats this season, making 15 Premier League appearances and forming a solid understanding with Granit Xhaka.",
      "It's understood the Blues reached out to Sunderland soon after they overcame them 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in October.",
      "Manchester United are not expected to make a move for legendary Spanish defender Sergio Ramos. Reports from Spain had linked Ramos with a move to Old Trafford in the January transfer window.",
      "However, ESPN understands there is no interest in signing the Real Madrid legend any time soon. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously made it clear the club wants to prioritise younger signings instead of older players on high salaries.",
      "As well as being 39 years old, Ramos, who recently revealed he will be leaving Mexican side Monterrey, may also demand a lofty salary. The central defender reportedly has no plans to retire at present and is also understood to be interested in a return to Europe.",
      "Manchester United's have re-piqued their interest in Conor Gallagher, according to reports.",
      "Give Me Sport understands Ruben Amorim's side are considering a loan move for the ex-Chelsea midfielder, who now plies his trade at Atletico Madrid, in the January transfer window.",
      "Gallagher has struggled to nail down a place in Diego Simeone's first eleven this season. Legs in midfield has been an issue for Amorim and if there is one thing Gallagher guarantees it's energy.",
      "Manchester United may do battle with Liverpool and Aston Villa for the signature of Ecuador star Nilson Angulo. The left-winger, who has also featured as a left-wing-back, boasts three goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances for Anderlecht.",
      "The 22-year-old already has his admirers as Liverpool and Villa are understood to be considering a move for him. South American news brand Bolavip understands United are one of many Premier League clubs to be impressed.",
      "His price-tag is understood to be around the £26million mark. Angulo has been touted as someone who could play a similar role to Amad Diallo, except the Ecuadorian would feature on the left.",
      "Manchester United are considering a move for Strasbourg striker Joaquin Panichelli. The Argentine forward, who is also on the radar of Chelsea, has 10 goals in 20 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Caught Offside understands United may be in the mix for his signature. The Reds signed Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha in the summer, but Sesko is more of an out-and-out striker compared to Cunha.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has also previosuly described himself as a nine-and-a-half, rather than a standard centre-forward. While there's no sign Sesko's place is under threat, it does suggest United may be looking for some strength in depth in the striker areas.",
      "Manchester United cult hero Louis Saha has urged the club to sign Danny Welbeck. The former United adademy star has been in excellent form for Brighton and Hove Albion, contributing seven goals in 15 Premier League appearances this season.",
      "Speaking to Pundit Arena, Saha said: \"I would have loved Manchester United to sign Danny at the start of the season. He’s not just very talented, but he’s very efficient and he’s experienced.",
      "\"When I came to the club, there was Van Nistelrooy and Solskjaer, but we had more than that. We had Tevez and Alan Smith, and there was depth, there was a variety. We all learned from each other.",
      "\"I think Sesko and other forward players would benefit by having someone like Welbeck to challenge them, to make them learn more about the game, more about positioning. Welbeck’s experience would give an example for them to all learn from, and I think if Danny arrives in the winter transfer window, he could make a huge difference to results on the pitch.\""

      "Speaking about De Ligt's injury after Wolves, Amorim said about his return: \"I don't know, sometimes you have an idea then you have to see day by day. I'm not going to say when he is coming back.”",
      "De Ligt was absent against West Ham and Wolves due to his knock. Although the Dutchman did not participate in training on Thursday, he was present at Carrington and conducted external media duties.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sesko will return to face Bournemouth. The striker's recovery from a knee injury is understood to have gone well, which hints that he could be involved.",
      "The Bournemouth game was identified as a realistic return date for Sesko when he suffered the issue against Tottenham on November 8. Amorim provided an update on November 21, saying: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Maguire picked up an injury, damaging his hamstring, in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham. Speaking last week, Amorim confirmed the English international was \"still out\" with the problem.",
      "The senior absentees opened the door for Shea Lacey, Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson to be involved with the training session. Lacey has been named in the last four Premier League matchday squads.",
      "Amorim has hinted that players from United's academy will be important when he loses Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations next week.",
      "Amorim said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

      "After acquiring a minority stake at Old Trafford in 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe launched a review into club operations and mass redundancies were made across departments to lower costs.",
      "Ratcliffe's review found United had the highest employee count in the Premier League.",
      "United released their latest financial figures on Thursday, confirming that the club operated in profit for the first financial quarter. United's CEO, Omar Berrada, reacted: “These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.”",
      "The figures also revealed total revenues of £140.3 million and an adjusted EBITDA of £26.9 million.",
      "However, there has been a deduction of 2 per cent in revenues, reflecting the absence of European broadcast revenues, and two fewer home games in the quarter compared with last year.",
      "The club believe the first quarter figures show they are making progress in improving their financial position, but sources have conceded that more hard work and discipline are required for long-term sustainability.",

      "That means sponsorship revenue has dropped by 9.3 per cent due to changes with the club's sponsorship agreements, following the expiration of the training kit deal with Tezos.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",

      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in and sponsoring the sleeves.",

      "Mainoo has been at United since joining the academy at nine years old, rising through the ranks before breaking into the first team during the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag. But since Amorim took charge last November, the midfielder has struggled to secure a regular starting role.",
      "Amorim has been firm in his vision for the squad, exiling several first-team players into what became known as the “bomb squad” - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "While Mainoo was not part of that group, his limited minutes are starting to raise concern. Across United’s last three matches, he has played just 13 minutes in total. The midfielders situation is starting to get on Scholes' nerves, with the United icon claiming he's so good he's probably 'embarrassing' Casemiro regularly in training.",
      "He told The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: \"Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "\"I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.",
      "\"Fair enough, as a manger sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "\"I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.\"",
      "Casemiro, despite previous criticism, has largely impressed this season and appears to be someone Amorim trusts. But at 33, and with his contract expiring next summer, the Brazilian is not seen as a long-term solution.",
      "Butt is also infuriated with Mainoo's treatment and has hinted at where the midfielder could move to. He said: \"The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game\"",
      "\"The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "\"If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we’re going to sell him and he’ll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, Elanga, Henderson – we can mention loads of them.",
      "\"We’re getting rid of players who love the football club, it’s mind-boggling. I get the Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don’t hear that about Kobbie.",
      "\"He’s a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I’m looking after him I’m telling him “we’re getting you out of that football club”.",
      "\"For his football career he has to leave United, he’s lost 18 months of development. I hope he goes abroad because it’s embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea, which could happen.",
      "\"They might go and get him because they are putting together a very good, young squad and keep buying young players. He could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.",
      "\"I’ve known Kobbie since he was eight but you wouldn’t be doing him justice if you told him to stay and not to take that move. That’s such a sad thing for me to say.\"",
      "Scholes agreed, saying: \"Do you know what? You’d have to advise him to go [to Chelsea], wouldn’t you? If he rang me and said 'look, Chelsea are interested, what do you think?' I’d say go all day long.\"",

      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "It was a non-negotiable for United to leave Molineux with three points, and it was comfortable in the end, despite the visitors' best efforts to give the worst team in the Premier League a chance of getting a result.",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the top flight. Amorim was furious when he spoke after that match, and he still looked agitated on the touchline against Wolves.",
      "\"He'll turn the Reds around,\" was sung just once at Old Trafford last week. The chant was missing from the catalogue in Wolverhampton and '12 Days of Cantona' was aired instead.",
      "United were one of three clubs in the Premier League to have no goals from substitutes so far this season, which must be put down to Amorim's tendency to make conservative changes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was named on the bench again. Mainoo scored a special 97th-minute match-winner against Wolves at Molineux in February 2024, when he was still considered an integral part of the team. On this occasion, there was a huge cheer for the youngster when he was introduced near the end.",
      "Cunha returned to Molineux for the first time since joining United and he mistakenly headed for the home team dressing room when he exited the team coach. Cunha milled about, speaking to Wolves staff and former teammates, and looked comfortable at the venue where his career took off.",
      "Ayden Heaven retained his starting role, despite a hellish 45 minutes against West Ham. The defender was hooked at the interval and was bound to be tested again by a physical Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "There were hundreds of seats vacant in the Sir Jack Hayward Stand and Stan Cullis Stand. Wolves fans protested against their owners by delaying their entry into the ground, but there were still plenty of gold seats when the demonstration was over and the disenchanted trickled in.",
      "Heaven apologised for a mix-up in communication with Senne Lammens. \"We want Fosun out, we want Fosun out,\" the Wolves protestors chanted. The United fans responded with a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer.",
      "There was mutiny in the air and Wolves fans could not believe what they had seen when Fernandes fired United into the lead. Cunha under-hit his pass to the skipper and the chance seemed to have gone, but the United captain squirmed the ball in at the front post. It was like a sketch from Benny Hill.",
      "Some fans speculated in the build-up to the game that Wolves had the potential to be Amorim's equivalent of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's visit to Vicarage Road in 2021. Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery after losing against Watford, and a defeat to Wolves would have been a similar nadir for Amorim.",
      "The home side had gone five successive league games without a goal, so United couldn't have had a better opportunity to record just their second clean sheet of the campaign. And they should have put the game to bed once they had taken the lead.",
      "This United side never does anything easily, though. The home side were level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a goal from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo enjoyed a brilliant October, but they regressed at the end of November and both were at the scene of the crime.",
      "The in-game management after taking the lead was dismal. United had experienced international players on the pitch and couldn't control the contest. There is little wonder that the conversation about Amorim's system has resurfaced, but United were able to carve through Wolves like a hot knife through butter when play resumed for the second half, in part because Wolves are shockingly bad.",
      "Not even United could mess up a visit to the league's worst team. Mbeumo slotted into an empty net after a square pass from Diogo Dalot, and Mason Mount scored to gain a two-goal cushion.",
      "Wolves' defending for both goals left plenty to be desired. United got the job done, but there should be concerns that Wolves threatened to make it a contest. The target is to return to the Champions League this season, and a Champions League team would have won with a cricket score.",
      "Fernandes converted a penalty to seal a captain's performance. The Portugal international has not been at his best in recent weeks, but it will be a huge boost if he peaks in the middle of the campaign.",
      "Amorim is hoping to emerge from the winter period without being bowled out and greater tests await in the coming weeks. Thankfully for United, they play Wolves again in just 21 days.",

      "Manchester United have rich history in the FA Youth Cup, the most prestigious competition in academy football. United have won the Youth Cup more than any other club and could extend that record this season.",
      "Darren Fletcher, manager of the Under-18s, has the talent at his disposal to lift the trophy, with the likes of JJ Gabriel, Kai Rooney, Louie Bradbury and Yuel Helafu all ready to contribute.",
      "And the competition rules state Fletcher will be able to call upon academy players who were under the age of 18 at midnight before the end of August, which gives United added strength.",
      "Bendito Mantato, Godwill Kukonki, Dan Armer, Amir Ibragimov and Jim Thwaites are just some of the players who represent the Under-21s but who are eligible to play in the Youth Cup.",
      "That's without mentioning Chido Obi, who could play in the competition again. Obi is currently recovering from a small injury, but he could feature in the Youth Cup for United for a second season in a row.",
      "Obi's goals fired the U18s to the semi-finals of the Youth Cup last season, in which they lost on penalties against eventual winners Aston Villa. Fletcher will be hoping his side can go two steps further this season.",
      "The U18s will begin their Youth Cup campaign against Peterborough at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. There should be a reasonable crowd, but it's a shame to see tickets priced at £10 for adults and £5 for children.",
      "Some may argue that Gabriel is worth paying the turnstile fee for. The 15-year-old is regarded as one of the most exciting talents to have ever come through the academy, and United did all they could to keep him in the summer, with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada involved in a meeting at Carrington.",
      "The 15-year-old has trained with the first team already. It's unusual for a player so young to be given that opportunity, but United believe he could eventually become the face of the club.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Kai Rooney has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right [wing]. Left-footed, coming in off the right.\"",
      "Michael Carrick's son, Jacey Carrick, also plays in United's academy, and he was handed his debut for the U18s last weekend, coming on from the bench with 20 minutes remaining against Newcastle. He is a left-footed midfielder and has been involved with England's Under-15s.",
      "There are story lines galore with the U18s this season and they are playing entertaining football, impressively beating Liverpool 7-0 at the end of November (Gabriel scored a hat-trick).",
      "Ticket prices should be lower for Tuesday's Youth Cup game, but the youngsters deserve support.",

      "Manchester United moved up to sixth in the Premier League with an ultimately comfortable victory at beleaguered Wolves.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went ahead in the first half when Bruno Fernandes squeezed home a shot after some dismal Wolves defending. United had dominated the opening quarter but after taking the lead they ceded the initiative to the home side and they responded by levelling in first half added time when Jean Bellegarde turned home from inside the box.",
      "United upped the ante after the break and restored the lead early in the second half when Bryan Mbeumo tapped into an empty net after a rush of blood from home keeper Sam Johnstone.",
      "Mason Mount made it three with a classy finish from a lovely Fernandes pass before the skipper rounded off the scoring from the spot after VAR intervened to award United a penalty for handball.",
      "Catch up with how the game unfolded plus the analysis and reaction here.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Mason Mount following Manchester United's victory against Wolves. United were heavy favourites to win against the Premier League's bottom side, who had claimed just two points all season, and they opened the scoring in the 25th minute through Bruno Fernandes after some comical defending.",
      "However, Wolves were level at the interval thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. The home side had not scored for five games, but they broke their duck after a strike from Bellegarde. Wolves were unable to build on that in the second half. United were gifted space in the final third and took advantage, scoring three more goals through Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and a Fernandes penalty.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Mount was now delivering consistently strong performances and here's what he had to say.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",

      "Read more here",
      "United are up to sixth with what turned out to be a comfortable win at Wolves.",
      "Here's the player ratings from Molineux with two 8/10s and Bruno Fernandes excellent",
      "There were boos at the full-time whistle, but most Wolves fans had already left Molineux to get home early, and you can't blame them. Wolves are the worst team in the Premier League by some stretch and not even this United side could slip up tonight. Fernandes and Mount were excellent. There will be stiffer tests ahead for United in the coming weeks, but the good news is they play Wolves again at Old Trafford before New Year.",
      "There's the whistle. Ultimately a comfortable evening for United and Ruben Amorim's men are up to sixth and level on points with Chelsea in fifth.",
      "Stay with us for the analysis and reaction and our player ratings will be along shortly",
      "Nine added minutes! Wolves fans and players do not like that!",
      "United can probably find a fifth or maybe a sixth if they really want it.",
      "The Reds are happy playing keep ball at the moment",
      "United take off Mount and Dalot with Zirkzee and Dorgu coming on.",
      "Very good penalty from the skipper as he buries it into the bottom corner",
      "United are worth this lead, they have dominated the second half and aside from a 15 minute spell at the end of the first half, they have outclassed a Wolves side who are going to start this season with no win from 15 league games and surely relegation beckons",
      "Bruno Fernandes scores from the spot.",
      "VAR intervene to send the referee to the monitor for a handball check. It's a spot kick, and it is very similar to one in the first half that was checked and cleared.",
      "Either way the Reds have a spot kick",
      "Here comes Kobbie. He's getting about 12 minutes plus added time.",
      "This is his 10th appearance off the bench for United in the league but his minutes have been sparse.",
      "He's got a chance to impress with the game all but won.",
      "Wolves have made a triple change to try and get back into this but they don't really have the quality to do so.",
      "If United defend properly there is a comfortable win to be had and potentially more goals as well.",
      "Yoro and Martinez replace Mazrouri and Heaven as Amorim, as he often does, changes his backline.",
      "Martinez return to the team being carefully managed after such a lengthy absence",
      "That third goal has knocked a bit of stuffing out of Wolves and United look like scoring with every attack - and there are plenty of them at the moment.",
      "Cunha has had three or four chances on his return to Molineux but hasn't found his radar.",
      "United about to make a double change at the back with Yoro and Martinez ready to come on",
      "Fernandes was denied with an effort but he clips in a lovely pass to Mount who made a fine run into space and finished with aplomb. Lovely volleyed goal from Mount and a super pass from the skipper.",
      "Bit of breathing space for the visitors now. 3-1 should really be enough for three points",
      "Lovely goal, lovely, lovely goal",
      "Wolves cause a bit of panic with a long throw which United just about scramble away.",
      "The home side then put the ball in the mixer again and again United look hesitant and uncertain at the back.",
      "United do not look secure defensively. In fact neither of these teams is doing much for the art of defending",
      "I have no idea where Johnstone was going there.",
      "Dalot was sent through and the keeper opted to come for the ball but was never going to get there allowing the United wing back to square for Mbeumo to tap into an empty net.",
      "United rewarded for a bright start to the second half but dear oh dear that was very poor play from the home side",
      "United are back in front as Mbuemo taps home with Dalot squaring for the frontman with Johnstone miles out of his net",
      "United make the first running of the second period and Cunha does well to fashion himself a yard of space just outside the box but his effort is over the top",
      "Johnstone is then out quickly to smother the ball at Cunha and the ball breaks to Mbeumo with the keeper stranded but Wolves had three or bodies back between player and goal and manage to scramble it away",
      "We are back under way at Molineux",

      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the league. They cannot drop further points tonight. They need a second goal to kill off the game and that will be discussed during half-time.",
      "Home side having their best spell of the game and sending a warning to United that they cannot rest on their laurels.",
      "Lammens hasn't really been forced into a save but there is still a bit of nervousness in that United backline.",
      "Whether Wolves have the quality to exploit it remains to be seen and at the other end, United are a threat every time they attack",
      "Wolves have finally realised they are playing a football match and start to get stuck into a few tackles which in turn rallies the crowd a bit.",
      "But United are carrying the greater threat. Dalot delivers a wonderful ball in which is turned behind for a corner.",
      "Then Amad gets a shot away which is deflected behind",
      "Mbeumo races clear in between two defenders and his poked effort is kept out by Johnstone.",
      "Ball falls to Cunha and his effort is hacked off the line and Amad turns the rebound wide.",
      "United can put this game to bed before the break if they go for the juggular here",
      "That was a comical goal. The chance looked to have been wasted, but Fernandes found a way to squirm the ball in at the front post.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" the home fans chant, which is followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "The Wolves fans are raging and rightly so. That was the kind of goal you expect a child’s grassroots football team to concede.",
      "Amorim was unhappy minutes before, screaming at the attack to press with more energy, but he should have a smile on his face now United have taken the lead.",
      "Well how do you explain that. Wolves hold onto the ball for an age, get the pocket picked and then Fernandes, in the box, falls over and still somehow gets up and scuffs a shot goalwards which somehow gets past Johnstone at his near post and dribbles in.",
      "Bruno Fernandes opens the scoring. Possibly the scrapiest goal you will ever see but United won't care. They lead"

Evans took up the position in June following his retirement as a player, but he has left after six months. He was responsible for arranging loans for youngsters and worked closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "When Evans was appointed, he said in a statement: “I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\" However, the 37-year-old has decided to leave to spend more time with his family, and it's understood he will now take time away from the game before deciding what to do next.",
      "United sources have said the departure is amicable and Evans leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club. Evans' transition into the role had confirmed the end of his playing career. The defender enjoyed two stints at United after coming through the club's academy and made 241 appearances for the Reds.",
      "The Northern Irishman won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups with United, while he made a total of 536 career appearances. Evans earned 107 caps for Northern Ireland and was awarded an MBE in 2023 for his services to football.",

Asked if he understood why Mainoo's status as a homegrown English player made him of specific interest, Amorim said: \"Of course I understand, and my job is to answer. But you always ask me the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "Maddison responded: \"Yeah, definitely. It wasn't that long ago he was starting in the Euros for England. I remember Kobbie's first start for England was a game I came on as a sub in and I was very impressed with how composed he was and the occasion just didn't get to him at all.",
      "\"He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don't see any way how he doesn't get back to a really high level.\"",
      "Meanwhile, after Mainoo was snubbed against West Ham, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at Amorim. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter. \"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Mainoo was named on a nine-man United bench to face Wolves, with the midfielder alongside fellow academy graduate Shea Lacey. Altay Bayindir, Patrick Dorgu, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee made up the Reds substitutes.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘accelerated contacts’ to land a Real Madrid star who is also on the radar of another top Premier League club.",
      "United moved to improve their attack heavily in the summer transfer window. They landed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, each of which have had a positive impact on the attack.",
      "Mbeumo has had the biggest impact, but will soon leave for the African Cup of Nations, while Sesko is currently sidelined through injury.",
      "United are being linked with more attacking talents, and according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, have ‘accelerated initial contacts’ to sign Real Madrid star Arda Guler.",
      "The Turkish forward/attacking-midfielder has 10 direct goal contributions this season and is largely starting games in one of the most star-studded squads in world football.",
      "Arsenal are also said to be emerging as one of the most active contenders for Guler.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly a strong contender, as well, said to be looking to revitalise their attack with potential departures on the horizon – Mohamed Salah the biggest.",
      "Previously, reports have also suggested that Tottenham have watched him in action, alongside a number of other top clubs.",
      "But crucially for all of those clubs, the decision will depend on Real’s stance, per the report. They state if Real decide that Guler doesn’t fit into their long-term plans, compelling offers could be made.",
      "But there seems almost no chance that Real would give up on Guler.",
      "He’s 20 years old, is able to play in multiple positions, already has 32 direct goal contributions for Real and has started 18 of a possible 22 games this season.",
      "He has played a part in every game Real have played this term and has largely impressed in them.",
      "As such, were anybody able to prise him away, it would take a ridiculous offer, that it’s almost certain nobody is going to make.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365:\n* Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another\n* Arsenal title, Wolves proper start, Man Utd top six – revisiting our 25/26 Premier League targets\n* Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Gyokeres falls below Wirtz",
      "Xabi Alonso’s recent comments on Guler essentially guarantee that Real will not easily let him go.",
      "He said: “He has the ability to have different heights, as well as different influences, depending on what the team needs. He has very good feet, he knows how to organise the game and at the same time, when you are already in the final third, give the decisive pass.",
      "“Even arriving a little in the second line: in the goal against Valencia he made a break and crossed to Kylian [Mbappe]. And it depends on what we have around us, it can be adapted.",
      "“That quality gives us flexibility in our approaches. But Arda is growing a lot and we have, I think I said it at the Club World Cup, to invest a lot in him. Because he is a special, different player.",
      "“We need to demand from him, but also understand the different phases he has. Support him and push him a lot so that he continues to perform at the level he is doing. And that there is still room for improvement, without a doubt.”",
      "Tottenham are among the clubs who have reportedly been ‘spotted’ at LaLiga fixtures watching a Real Madrid star in action, as club sources have confirmed their current view."

      "A very silly report has claimed that FC Barcelona have decided to include Marcus Rashford in a swap deal with La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy for around £26m from Premier League giants Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The England international secured his dream move to the Spanish giants after returning to form during his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of last season.",
      "Barcelona were linked with alternatives, but they opted to take a punt on Rashford after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the forward’s versatility attracting head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "Rashford was only expected to be a bit-part player for Barcelona, but his great form has forced Flick into playing him consistently, as he has sparkled this season. He has six goals and eleven assists in his 21 appearances across all competitions.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Sunderland v Newcastle, Aston Villa, Xavi Simons, Oliver Glasner",
      "Therefore, it feels pretty likely that Rashford will join Barcelona permanently, though a new report from an outlet in Spain claims they have an ‘unexpected alternative’ in mind.",
      "Instead, Barcelona are said to have an outlandish plan to sign and offload Rashford in the same window, with the club reportedly including him in a £61m [70 million euros] swap deal with Atletico Madrid to sign former Manchester City star Julian Alvarez.",
      "Will this happen? No. But who would we be if we faulted their imagination?",
      "The report goes onto say that the ‘conditions are set’ for this deal, with a £61m fee and Rashford said to be used by Barcelona to acquire Alvarez.",
      "MUST-READ FEATURES ON F365…\n*  Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another\n*  Arsenal title, Wolves proper start, Man Utd top six – revisiting our 25/26 Premier League targets\n*  Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Gyokeres falls below Wirtz",
      "The report explains: ‘Atlético Madrid haven’t ruled out signing the English striker if Julián Álvarez ultimately ends up at Barcelona. Diego Simeone greatly appreciates Rashford ‘s profile, particularly his speed and directness in exploiting space from any attacking area. For the Argentine coach, acquiring a player of that calibre would be a way to compensate for such a significant loss as that of the Argentine striker.",
      "‘Thus, Atlético has set its conditions. They value Julián Álvarez at €120 million and Rashford at around €50 million, which is why they are demanding an additional €70 million for the deal to move forward and be finalised.’",
      "Regarding Rashford’s resurgence over the past year, former Man Utd player West Brown has explained why he was “always going to do well” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "“Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He’d been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple,” Brown told BetWright Casino.",
      "“He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don’t blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn’t in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn’t working.",
      "“It’s great to see how well he is doing now at Barcelona, he’s absolutely flying and he deserved to get back into the England squad. I’m sure he will have a great World Cup.”",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has suggested Spurs are “scraping around for players” amid links to Marcus Rashford, who he wouldn’t sign given a lack of loyalty.",
      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could now return to Old Trafford as Barcelona are ‘not convinced’ by the England international, according to reports.",
      "Barcelona are uncertain about signing Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United, according to reports in Spain.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford may not get his permanent move to Barcelona in the summer but PSG have ‘tested’ the Man Utd waters with an intriguing swap offer amid interest from Arsenal."

      "Wharton is arguably the superior player of these three, but this does not mean that he will, or even should, be signed by Man Utd.",
      "This has not stopped Fichajes from talking up the prospect of this deal happening, though.",
      "Their latest on Wharton claims Man Utd are ‘preparing to complete a blockbuster signing’, with the club having ‘activated one of the most ambitious moves in their sporting planning and are preparing to launch a €100 million bid [£87.5m] for Wharton’.",
      "Regarding Palace’s supposed demands, the report adds:",

      "‘Manchester United knows it’s not alone in the race for Adam Wharton. Manchester City and Arsenal have shown genuine interest in the midfielder, while Tottenham have also inquired with Crystal Palace.’",
      "There are a couple of reasons why this is incredibly unlikely.",
      "Firstly, why on earth would Crystal Palace accept £87.5m for Wharton when a World Cup is approaching, and there are multiple Big Six sides in the market for a centre-midfielder?",
      "To put it simply, they would not and it would actually take an offer above £100m to get Palace, who have remained firm in the past regarding Marc Guehi, to the negotiating table.",
      "Also, Wharton is capable of playing in the No.6 role, but he is far from specialised in this position, as he is better used as a No.8, so Baleba and Anderson are far more obvious fixes to Man Utd’s defensive midfield problem than the Palace star.",
      "It is not unusual for Fichajes to talk utter nonsense, but the one truthful suggestion in this report is that Man Utd’s supposed swoop for Wharton is the ‘most ambitious move’, because it is not going to happen…",
      "The agent of Crystal Palace star and Manchester United target Adam Wharton has spoken openly about a future transfer.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker insists that Joshua Zirkzee is “nowhere near the level” of Benjamin Sesko and doubts he will “ever” come good at Old Trafford.",
      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than the Red Devils last season with Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund – who both signed under previous boss Erik ten Hag – scoring just seven league goals between them.",
      "Man Utd co-owners Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS spent around £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha in order to improve their attacking output under Ruben Amorim.",
      "That has worked to a certain extent but there are still massive question marks over Sesko, who has scored just twice this season, and Zirkzee, who has only started three Premier League matches.",
      "And Parker insists Zirkzee is “not going to make a difference for Man United ever” with Sesko on another level to the Netherlands international.",
      "Parker told AceOdds.com: “He is nowhere near the level of Sesko, who is very unselfish and makes all the right runs, and we also see now how big of a gap there is between the two of them. Zirkzee is just miles away from what is expected when you play at Man United.",
      "READ: Gallagher for Mainoo at Man Utd is swapping one Bruno Fernandes backup for another",
      "“It`s quite ironic actually, that Zirkzee is now playing more because Sesko is injured, but I think Zirkzee would rather want Sesko to be ready and play ahead of him, so he can get his loan move away in January. He might miss out on it now because of Sesko’s injury.",
      "“I don’t like what I am seeing from Zirkzee at all. Everything about him is trying to be flashy and it just doesn’t work. He has to be frustrated, because nothing works out for him. He looks like he is frustrated, and I totally get it, but at the end of the day it is his own fault.",
      "“I am wondering at times what they actually saw in Zirkzee. Fair enough, he is alright on the ball and his touch is decent, but he is just not going to make a difference for Man United ever.”",
      "Matthijs De Ligt’s performances have improved this season and Parker thinks the Man Utd centre-back is now “one of the best defenders in the Premier League”.",
      "Parker added: “I think de Ligt has matured a lot since arriving at Man United, and I consider him to be one of the best defenders in the Premier League. He is good when playing in the middle as he can lead, dictate and communicate very well.",
      "“De Ligt can do everything. He is good on the ball, he is a big guy who likes to take on challenges and he is very brave. But he is also very controlled, and he doesn`t get caught out of position a lot.",
      "“He is way different from Maguire. De Ligt is structured and can make people follow him, but he does it in a natural way. He is not screaming and waving his arms at people. He takes responsibility.",
      "“He is always trying to do the right thing, and he is really leading in the right way. Man United haven’t had a player like him for many years. After the Everton game I heard people saying that Man United miss Maguire, and I was just thinking to myself… That tells me that people don’t want to improve. What are they thinking?”",
      "Roma are reportedly keen to send Evan Ferguson back to Brighton and sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee as his replacement.",
      "A new report has explained why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been ‘bothered by’ two of his teammates this season.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker insists Noni Madueke has “more about him” than Arsenal team-mate Bukayo Saka.",
      "Four Premier League clubs are interested in Joshua Zirkzee, but it’s Roma who have taken pole position.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has claimed Bruno Fernandes is ‘not a leader’ and suggested he cannot be mentioned in the same breath as some of the club’s great ...",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has been told that he was “absolutely terrible” vs Wolves even though he scored a brace in his side’s 4-1 victory."

The battle is already raging in the Premier League… and it concerns a name still relatively unknown to the general public, but not to scouts: Noah Sadiki. The Congolese midfielder from Sunderland is attracting a lot of attention, to the point that Manchester United and Chelsea have decided to step up their pursuit.",
      "“According to our information, Chelsea acted immediately after the Black Cats’ last match against the Blues on October 25th, contacting Sunderland to inquire about the asking price for the young talent. This direct approach is a sign of the very serious interest from Stamford Bridge.",
      "“But Chelsea aren’t alone. Manchester United have long had Sadiki in their sights: the Red Devils had already approached the player’s representatives at the start of the season, proof that the situation is being closely monitored.

      "“First of all, you need the vision to do that and second, you need the technique to do that. He’s got both.",
      "“There’s some great midfield players in the country at the moment, but I just think that Wharton is the one who, if I was a top team, I would try and buy him. He’d be perfect for Manchester United. Go and get your cash out for him. Go and get him.”"

      "Signing a new central midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “try before you buy” interest in Conor Gallagher is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro proving that the football hasn’t left him quite yet has made the requirement for a new midfielder feel less urgent than it did a few weeks ago, and may very well have saved Amorim from the sack, but it remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insisted in October that recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, quite how he would fit into Amorim’s team is a mystery.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative to Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 72 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, United could revisit their interest in Gallagher in a ‘try before you buy’ deal with Atletico Madrid ‘open’ to an initial loan.",
      "Speaking on The United Stand, Jacobs said: “Man United see Conor Gallagher as a good ‘try before you buy’ option, if Atletico are open to a loan deal next month.”",
      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; a ‘safe pair of hands’ who’s started just seven games for Atletico Madrid this season.",
      "And while he’s ‘the sort of player every manager wants in their team’, he isn’t – and this is the only point that matters here – a composed, deep-lying screen for the back five. What they need as an Adam Wharton and what they would be signing is another, arguably inferior, Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The wantaway academy graduate isn’t playing as he can’t provide the foil for Bruno Fernandes to thrive like Casemiro or – ostensibly – Manuel Ugarte can.",
      "And although Amorim wouldn’t have the same apparent concerns over Gallagher’s ability to “get round the pitch” that he apparently has with Mainoo, signing a player – even on loan – knowing that they’re going to be something of a square peg in a round hole makes very little sense.",
      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. If Kobbie Mainoo isn’t that man, then neither is Conor Gallagher.",
      "Man Utd are looking at the possibility of sealing a temporary deal to sign Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher in January, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Bayern Munich have seen an opportunity to sign Kobbie Mainoo from Man Utd in the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Including Mo Salah leaving Liverpool and the signing of his replacement, we have predicted the 10 biggest transfers that will happen in January.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has commented on Kobbie Mainoo’s situation at Old Trafford, insisting that the midfielder needs to leave next year.",

      "He added: “I’m enjoying it because knowing you have that experience around you, you are not scared to go on the front foot and not scared of what you leave behind either. They’re always there when I need them.”",
      "Now, a report from The Daily Mail claims Arsenal were not too disheartened at losing Heaven because 16-year-old Marli Salmon is viewed as a ‘baby William Saliba’, while a ‘path to the first team is already marked out’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘So much so, Daily Mail Sport understands that the departure of Ayden Heaven, 19, to Manchester United in February was accepted internally because they knew what they had in Salmon.’",
      "Regarding Salmon, a source for the outlet said: ‘On the ball he’s excellent, and physically for his age he’s strong.",
      "‘Typically, you get chances as a centre back at first-team level later on as you then grow into an adult, but he could well be one of the players that breaks through and gets an early opportunity. He was outstanding against Bayern Munich’s Under 19s and put in some great tackles.’"

      "We’ve surprised ourselves this week by discovering we were apparently just so damn keen to move on from 2024/25 that before it even ended we’d already reeled off one of our favourite summer features of setting a target for each and every Premier League club in 2025/26.",
      "So early did we go that we didn’t even have Sunderland in there because they weren’t even a Premier League club yet. Which, let’s be entirely honest, almost certainly prevented us showing our entire arse with some kind of ‘Beat Derby lol’ nonsense.",
      "Really, though, the reason we truly like this particular feature is that when we get a club right we get to say ‘Hurrah, we were right’ and award ourselves two ego puff points, but when we get a club wrong we just go ‘Silly club didn’t do what it was told’. Perfect.",
      "Anyway. Here’s a look back at what is an inevitably mixed bag of not-even-summer targets for the year ahead, and an updated one for whatever new reality each club now finds itself in.",
      "",
      "There will be plenty of self-flagellation to come later so please allow us a small amount of early smugness here, even allowing for the fact the striker they signed has not yet been a particularly pivotal figure in the whole caper.",
      "If Arsenal get the summer right, which means bringing in at least one proper goalscoring striker and in an ideal world two, there should be more doubts about everyone else – including Liverpool – than the Gunners.",
      "There really is no compelling evidence to suggest a De Bruyne-less Man City are going to suddenly destroy the field again, while Liverpool still have to prove this season was the start of something new and not the last hurrah of the old.",
      "They bought a striker, they are top of the league, there are fewer doubts about them than everyone else. Ignore how much Viktor Gyokeres has actually contributed, the main point is: we were right.",
      "Now Arsenal just need to finish the job. Easy-peasy lemon squeezy. Unless they make it difficult, difficult lemon difficult but for goodness’ sake, when has any Arsenal side ever done that from a really promising position at this stage of the season?",
      "",
      "After a troubling start to the season, one where Villa were winless after five games and even goalless after four, they have ticked this off and then some. A run of nine wins in 10 Premier League games – including victories over both teams that are now apparently their title rivals – has transformed Villa’s season.",
      "It really could now be a spectacular season, but we still suspect that Villa’s actual level sits somewhere between the two absurd extremes we’ve seen thus far. But also that it’s definitely closer to the ‘nine wins in 10’ bit than the ‘no wins in five’ part.",
      "A sustained title challenge would be spectacular, but qualifying for the Champions League still feels like a far fairer and realistic ambition.",
      "Worth remembering here, of course, that there are two ways Villa can achieve this and either would be entirely acceptable. A top four/five finish would represent serious progress and show ability to sustain themselves in that part of the table in a way no outsider in the Big Six era has managed for more than a couple of seasons in succession (looking at you, Newcastle) but winning the Europa League would probably be more fun. They do have the Premier League’s most ridiculous trophy drought.",
      "And they almost certainly won’t have to finish 17th to do it.",
      "",
      "So perfectly on track that they’ve actually made the first bit that bit easier by continuing the Andoni Iraola trait of being an outrageously streaky team that is always in either Champions League form or relegation form but never under any circumstances anything in between.",
      "Bournemouth won five and drew three of their first nine Premier League games, losing only at Liverpool long before anyone knew that was embarrassing.",
      "Their subsequent six games? Two draws and four defeats.",
      "And this is absolutely nothing new. Last season Iraola’s side followed an 11-game run featuring seven wins and four draws, culminating in back-to-back 4-1 and 5-0 eviscerations of Champions League-chasing Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, with a run of one win and five defeats in their next eight.",
      "Even the one win was at Southampton, which doesn’t really count.",
      "The year before, they won none of their first nine Premier League games and then won seven of the next nine. Then none of the next seven. Then four of the next five.",
      "They’re just great fun, is what we’re saying here, but while those good streaks will always see Iraola linked with whichever Big Six/Seven/Eight club is currently committing a bed-sh*tting, the bad ones mean he really might never actually end up metaphorically boil-washing the besh*tted Man United/Spurs/Wherever bedsheets at all.",
      "",
      "Unlike your Bournemouths and the Crystal Palaces of this world, Brentford were unable to keep hold of the manager who’d shifted the entire idea of what the club could be, with Thomas the Frank Engine choo-chooing off to the debatably greener pastures of Tottenham.",
      "Brentford then chose to gamble on a rookie continuity candidate in Keith Andrews in a summer otherwise devoid of continuity. Frank took several other members of his coaching team with him to Spurs, while the playing squad lost key players in Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard.",
      "Remarkably, though, the ‘finish mid-table’ part remains absolutely bang on as a reasonable target with Brentford approaching the always-pivotal Busy Festive Period at a fascinating crossroads; six points away from the bottom three, six points away from the top five.",
      "",
      "Almost everyone outside the most stifling heat of the relegation fight has had a go at bothering the top six this season. For several weeks now it’s felt like all the positions between fourth and 14th are simply being handed out on some kind of rota basis at the end of each round of matches, and Brighton have certainly had their turn.",
      "Such is the congestion below the top three that you could certainly argue half the division are hitting a target of ‘bothering the top six’ but it’s nevertheless a ‘yes, this is fine, continue being fine’ half-term appraisal for a Brighton side currently eighth and two points below the top six.",
      "There are also two ways to take ‘bother the top six’.",
      "Reading what we wrote in May, it’s very clear we meant in terms of your own league position. But beating three of last season’s top six in the space of your first eight games of this season must surely also score ‘bother the top six’ points? It’s our feature and our rules, anyway, and we say it does.",
      "",
      "You can tell just how weary we had grown of the naff efforts made by promoted clubs over the previous two seasons with this one, our assessment also featuring the words ‘dread prospect of a year of ritual Premier League humiliation’ and also – truly incongruously now just seven short months later – the words ‘Sheffield’ and ‘United’.",
      "It doesn’t feel like Burnley are in fact embarrassing themselves like last time. They’ve been competitive more often than not and been unfortunate to come out on the wrong side of some close finishes.",
      "But they are also 19th and on track to finish the season with 25 points. Last time they were in the Premier League they finished 19th with 24 points.",
      "",
      "Would have seemed absurd just a couple of weeks ago, this one, with Enzo Maresca manoeuvring Chelsea nicely onto the shoulders of the leaders as well as being crowned actual world champions in the summer.",
      "But those nagging ‘small-time’ concerns are re-emerging, with the fear after ropey results domestically and in Europe over the last couple of weeks that the manager has once again succeeded in self-fulfillingly talking Chelsea out of contention for things by insisting that little old them could never be in contention in the first place.",
      "Particularly maddening on this occasion given that just before this latest wobble Chelsea had so compellingly displayed their bona fides by battling to a point against Arsenal having played the last hour with 10 men.",
      "It’s now looking like two seasons in a row that Chelsea’s title campaign is going to hit the rocks at the exact moment it began to look truly compelling and, for a manager who – despite that Club World Cup bauble – does need to prove he can challenge for the actual top honours in the game it is worrying for it to become something that starts to look like a trend.",
      "",
      "Not even finally breaking through the 50-point ceiling could get Palace higher than 12th last season, something that quite literally nobody cared about when they also went on to win the FA Cup. Which was absolutely correct of everyone.",
      "They’re trending for an even better return than last year’s 53 points but a top-half finish would still represent success in a season where they’ve also had to juggle Conference League commitments.",
      "That’s been a challenge for them and they still have work to do just to make the knockouts of the Conference, but any English side in that competition has to have winning it as an obvious and achievable season target, even if in this specific case more silverware one year after your first ever silverware feels kind of greedy.",
      "Palace are currently fourth in the Premier League which makes Champions League qualification a perfectly acceptable stretch target but, as we’ve said, you do have to remember that all positions between fourth and 14th are currently being allocated at random week-by-week. They don’t actually mean anything, and Palace are still only four points above the bottom half right now.",
      "",
      "Our argument back in the summer was that the unknown quantity of a move to a new stadium, even (especially?) one as spectacular as the Hill Dickinson, could nullify home advantage for Everton and thus that standing still and remaining clear of any kind of relegation unpleasantness would represent progress.",
      "Everton’s change of address will in time be one that requires more than mere comfortable survival, but for now that does feel like enough. It will likely take a while for Everton – fans, players, everyone – to get used to the new environment and that loss of the familiarity that’s so important to the idea of home advantage could easily counter or even outweigh the sheer buzz of it all.",
      "Seems fair, then, with the scale of that upheaval and the inevitable unknown quantities involved that a smooth ‘more of the same’ on-field transition be the primary target here.",
      "Seems fair now to note Everton have overshot that target already. They’ve even flirted at times with the idea of being actual fun. Love that for them.",
      "Even if we remember that at this time all league positions between fourth and 14th are the same thing, we still can’t help but enjoy the fact they were fifth for a bit at the weekend. Fifth! Everton! Like it’s the 80s or something! Marvellous.",
      "",
      "Been quite sh*t for a lot of this season, really, and at times it’s looked like it really could threaten the nice quiet life they’d carved out for themselves as the Premier League’s mid-tablest club.",
      "Back in the summer, we wanted more from a team that when you asked how much more mid-table they could the answer was none. None… more mid-table.",
      "Especially as all those mid-table finishes had been accompanied by slow meandering finishes that gave the game away a bit about survival still being the main target and Fulham simply becoming a club that was able to achieve that easily and quickly without ever really feeling it necessary to explore any loftier ambition.",
      "We still think They’ll Be Fine, but, while defeats to Man City and Crystal Palace need not signify the imminent falling in of the sky, they have left Fulham in some danger of dropping out the back of the mid-table peloton that absolutely feels like it’s their natural habitat and into a relegation dogfight. Especially as, unlike recent years, it does look like at least one of the relegation places is going to involve an actual meaningful fight.",
      "",
      "Back in May our concern really was not so much what Leeds would do as who they could realistically drag in to a relegation battle.",
      "The difficulty lies in identifying the clubs they can overhaul, and this is where the growing gulf becomes such a problem. Leeds have been the best side in the Championship, but a look at the clubs just above the relegation zone this year should terrify them.",
      "Fine, Spurs and Man United will probably be less stupid next season and can surely be ignored, but above them are your West Hams and Wolves and the Evertons of this world. And Leeds have an awful lot of work to do before their squad is anything like ready to compete with what those lads already have.",
      "Leeds, West Ham and Wolves have all played their part here. Leeds are currently outside the bottom three and with every chance of remaining there. And that should still constitute a perfectly acceptable first season for any promoted team, even one of Leeds’ size where it can quite rightly only ever be stage one of a grander plan of establishing yourself as a top-flight force.",
      "",
      "Ah. Here’s what we said in May:",
      "Will obviously start the season as favourites given the way they’ve destroyed the competition this year, but rightly or wrongly we still have our nagging doubts about Liverpool’s ability to turn this season’s domination into a team that defines a Premier League era and hoover up multiple titles.",
      "It’s undeniable that this season’s success was Arne Slot winning with Jurgen Klopp’s team – all due respect to the sizeable contribution of Federico Chiesa – and while that does in so many ways make the achievement all the more impressive it does also raise questions.",
      "Was this just a wonderful coming together, a bottling of lightning in which Slot’s coaching style and Klopp’s squad were able to achieve the spectacular? Can Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah go again or will the years start to catch up with them? And who picks up the slack then? And we’ve not even started on TAA.",
      "There will, obviously, be more comings and goings this summer than last and while it isn’t necessarily as straightforward as Liverpool MUST defend their title to prove they are here to stay, they absolutely do need to be right in there and involved to the end to convince us this is the start of a Liverpool dynasty and not just one stunning season.",
      "That’s all looking uncomfortably accurate for a Liverpool squad also trying to cope with the unspeakable tragedy of Diogo Jota’s death.",
      "We’ve all had our fun with Liverpool’s on-field crisis this season, but the elephant in the room throughout it all is the fact this is a group of players, a club, still working its way through a grieving process in the full glare of the Premier League spotlight.",
      "Perhaps not even Slot or his players themselves would be able to accurately weigh how big a factor it’s been in their on-pitch struggles.",
      "But the reality is that Liverpool do find themselves in precisely the sort of place we feared for them, one in which 24/25 starts to look like a freakish one-off season where a new manager working with the old manager’s squad was able to bottle lightning.",
      "Salah and Van Dijk have looked old and tired this season, with the former now at loggerheads with the club where his legendary status has long been assured. The yearning to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold’s unique right-back skillset has seen Dominik Szoboszlai thrown in there more than once just to try and capture that playmaker’s spirit from such an unusual area of the field.",
      "Their title defence is already over with the gap to Arsenal a yawning 10 points. But the gap to Crystal Palace in fourth is only three. There remains absolutely no reason why Liverpool can’t go on the kind of run that, while coming up short of propelling them into the title race, leaves them nevertheless well clear of the remaining European chasers.",
      "",
      "We’re not entirely sure quite how they’ve done it, but being second and somehow only two points behind Arsenal after 15 games isn’t just ‘title challenge’ areas for Pep Guardiola Manchester City but tremendously familiar title challenge areas for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City.",
      "They’re actually better off than they were 15 games into either the 2022/23 season, when they trailed the Gunners by five points at this stage, or 2023/24 season when the gap was six points.",
      "",
      "This target was actually for us back in May by Manchester United themselves. We thought it a silly target and took the p*ss.",
      "Not what we’d have gone for, because there currently appear to be – at a rough estimate – 15 teams better placed to achieve this but it is apparently the target United’s brains trust has set Ruben Amorim and his merry band of dafties, so there it is.",
      "And where are they now? Sixth. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Brutal, but Newcastle will remain the flimsiest contender for Big Eight status until they can stitch two good league seasons together.",
      "And they haven’t yet managed it, with the current pattern from an admittedly small sample size being qualifying for the Champions League, then struggling with the added workload, then qualifying again with a reduced workload, then struggling again.",
      "Obviously – as has become a recurring theme throughout this update – we must not become too distracted one way or the other by current league positions. Unless you’re in the top three or bottom five it’s all basically the same.",
      "Newcastle are 12th, which is bad, but also three points off a probable Champions League position, which is fine. At some point, the current mid-table gridlock will disperse with obvious winners and losers, with no reason Newcastle can’t be among the former. Though they might want to stop chucking away points.",
      "In the Champions League itself, it’s been better than their last effort with a play-off spot almost certain and a strong likelihood of being seeded in that play-off round. Two wins and it could still be a top-eight finish, but that does require winning away at PSG.",
      "",
      "Of all the teams who simply didn’t listen to our sage early-summer advice, Nottingham Forest are among those who didn’t listen the hardest.",
      "Did we say fall out with the manager who made you good? No. Did we say then appoint the manager who took Spurs down to 17th to get you out of a nascent relegation fight? No. Did we say to then sack that manager and bring in Sean Dyche a few weeks later? Well, to be fair, by that point yeah we did kind of think that was probably for the best. But bloody hell.",
      "The only way to avoid one-season-wondering themselves now is to steer sufficiently clear of relegation trouble that they can laser-focus on the Europa League across the last four months of the season a la Tottenham.",
      "We’re really not sure they’ve got it in them.",
      "",
      "We’re going to be very honest and say our pre-season target for Sunderland would definitely have involved the word ‘Derby’. The only way that could possibly now work is if the target involved beating Newcastle.",
      "Which it now absolutely could. Sunderland are slap bang in the middle of the big mid-table bottleneck, and staying anywhere near there would constitute a staggering success.",
      "",
      "Look, the Spursy thing is overplayed isn’t it? Obviously it is. But at the same time… there really isn’t anyone else like them. What other club could end the most infamous trophy drought in English football, have a massive f*ck off great cathartic party afterwards, and then less than six months later be in a position where they’ve sacked the manager, sacked the man who sacked the manager and found themselves in a position where the fans hate the players and the players hate the fans?",
      "The maddest thing about Spurs’ complete and utter failure to deliver anything remotely like what we asked of them – despite appointing the most sensible manager in all the land to try and do it – is that when we asked them to please be sensible they didn’t even yet have the advantage of winning the Europa League and creating an environment where sensible really did become a viable option.",
      "Spurs are completely f*cked if they don’t win the final, and might be quite f*cked even if they do. Even if they do win it, they probably need to thank Ange Postecoglou profusely for delivering on his second-season-trophy promise in the most absurd manner imaginable and move on.",
      "What they definitely need to be next season is just less utterly, repeatedly and predictably mental.",
      "Haha Spursy nonsense go brrrrr",
      "",
      "Let it never be said, though, that Spurs are London’s only nonsense comedy club.",
      "West Ham f*cked this within about three weeks of the season starting and are still scrambling to repair the damage after at least having the good sense to pounce on Nottingham Forest’s identity crisis and bag themselves a Nuno Espirito Santo to put them back on an even keel in the latest instalment of West Ham’s relentless Be Careful What You Wish For lurching between safety first, low ceiling-high floor managers and high-ceiling-but-no-floor at all punts.",
      "",
      "You didn’t do the thing we said! You did the exact opposite of the thing! Why would you do that, Wolves? Why?",
      "Look at how close we were to this summer punchline paying off in full, though.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",
      "Someone like Gary O’Neil, maybe.",
      "But still. Vitor Pereira getting his marching order on November 2 makes it all feel just a bit too on the nose despite the near miss regarding his replacement.",
      "Having asked Wolves to start the season ‘properly’ they have instead out-Wolvesed even their own propensity for bad starts by delivering the worst Premier League start ever.",
      "Turns out there really was a Derby-botherer among us this season after all.",
      "",

      "Mohamed Salah and Arne Slot are no longer BFFs but their fall-out is a mere tiff compared to some of these bust-ups between managers and their players…",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is splitting Arsenal fans between those who believe he is a massive waste of money and his loyal defenders.",
      "Sunderland v Newcastle is back on the Premier League fixture list after almost a decade away, and have Aston Villa set themselves up for a fall?",
      "We’ve forecast the glorious homecoming of a former player to manage every Premier League club amid Xabi Alonso to Liverpool links."

      "AS Roma are reportedly keen to send Evan Ferguson back to Brighton and sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee as his replacement.",
      "It’s not going well in Rome for the young Irishman, who has only registered one goal and one assist since joining on loan from Brighton.",
      "Reports suggest Roma are hoping to end Ferguson’s loan spell prematurely, though there is no clause allowing them to do so unilaterally. However, they can negotiate a termination, and if they do, Roma will likely push to sign Zirkzee from Man United.",
      "Two reports from our friends at TEAMtalk claim Ferguson has been offered to multiple clubs ahead of the winter transfer window, while Roma are in ‘pole position’ to land Zirkzee.",
      "The first report says Everton, Leicester City and Celtic are among the clubs in contention for Ferguson’s signature, which is a far cry from the teams linked with a £100million move only two years ago.",
      "Everton have ‘made checks’ despite spending £27m on Thierno Barry last summer.",
      "Adding ‘another layer of intrigue’, Roma and Everton are under the same ownership, which could smooth out negotiations in January.",
      "Roma would be even more eager to send Ferguson back to Brighton if they can agree a deal with Man United for Zirkzee.",
      "TEAMtalk also reports ongoing negotiations between Ruben Amorim’s side and the Italian giants, with United ‘open to offers’ of €35-40m (£30.6-35m) or a loan with a mandatory purchase clause.",
      "The Giallorossi face competition from four Premier League clubs, Aston Villa, West Ham, Brighton and Everton, while Serie A rivals Juventus, Inter and AC Milan are also credited with interest.",
      "Competition is fierce and includes some top clubs, despite Zirkzee largely underwhelming since joining United from Bologna in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "The Dutch international cost the Red Devils around £35m and has scored just eight goals and provided three assists in 58 matches.",
      "He has only started three games this season, all in United’s last four Premier League matches, but has made a positive impact during that run.",
      "Zirkzee knows he must be playing regularly to stand a chance of making Ronald Koeman’s squad for next summer’s World Cup. And when Benjamin Sesko returns from injury, there’s a chance Amorim starts overlooking him again.",
      "Sesko hasn’t done enough to convince Zirkzee that he won’t play once the Slovenian is back fit, but managers can show bias towards players they sign, which applies to Sesko, not Zirkzee.",
      "As for Ferguson, it’s not clear what the future holds or whether he’ll ever come close to realising the potential he once seemed destined for.",
      "Not long ago, there was talk of him commanding a £100m fee and Brighton cashing in yet again on a player they bought for peanuts.",
      "But not anymore. There’s a strong chance he ends up at Leicester, who sit 13th in the Championship. And if he flops there, it’s hard to see a future for him in the Premier League, let alone at one of Europe’s elite clubs.",
      "It’s an unfortunate position for Brighton to be in. They never expected Ferguson’s Roma loan to go so poorly, and now they may be forced into a last-chance-saloon loan. They could become the victims of a striker domino.",

      "A new report has explained why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been ‘bothered by’ two of his teammates this season.",
      "Four Premier League clubs are interested in Joshua Zirkzee, but it’s Roma who have taken pole position.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘rejected an offer’ for Joshua Zirkzee as they will ‘only’ let him leave in January on one condition.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United will make a ‘U-turn’ on letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club during the winter transfer window on one condition.",
      "According to reports, Joshua Zirkzee has ‘said yes’ to leaving Manchester United in January and a transfer is ‘now closer’ to happening."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is “not aware of any contact” between Man Utd and Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos ahead of the January transfer market.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim over the summer with over £200m in new signings, including big deals for Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, there are rumours that Man Utd are prepared to spend again in the winter market with a rumour that Real Madrid legend Ramos could provide some much-needed experience in defence.",
      "But Romano has ruled out that potential signing for the time being with the Italian not hearing of any contact between the two parties.",
      "READ: Semenyo to replace Salah at Liverpool as 10 likeliest January transfers ranked",

      "A new midfielder is top of the Red Devils’ list in the January transfer window but Man Utd’s promising financial are unlikely to have any impact on their winter budget.",
      "Man Utd revealed that they registered an operating profit of £13m compared to an operating loss of £7m a year ago when releasing their results for the first quarter of the new financial year.",
      "“Whilst Berrada has hailed the robust’ financial figures, and pointed out in this financial statement that Man Utd are ‘committed to, and complying with, the Premier League’s PSR rules’ – the truth is, Man Utd don’t have huge money to spend, and it is much more likely they will save their big transfer investment until the summer, rather than pay what would likely be inflated fees to try to land some of their targets in January.",
      "“Signing a world-class defensive midfielder remains the priority, but again, that is much more likely in the summer rather than January, with interest in Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.”",
      "A potential deal for Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson could have to wait until the summer, if Man Utd go down that path, and former defender Paul Parker isn’t sure he’d be a good investment for £100m.",
      "Parker told Goal: “I keep seeing his name bandied about. When it’s Manchester United, everybody wants to throw out someone all the time. Everyone goes with it.",
      "“I’m not used to labelling players with numbers. You just want a midfield player who has got the capability to go up and down, wants to go up and down, and he definitely has that. I’m quite sure a lot of these young players don’t want to be labelled anymore. They did all that when they were kids playing FIFA. When it gets to the real world, you see that they want to get about. In my opinion you want midfield players like a Roy Keane, a Paul Ince, a Bryan Robson – players who can and want to do everything.",
      "“I see where he is [Anderson] and I quite like him. The moment you mention it with Manchester United it’s £100m. That seems to be the going rate. Are United going to go and spend that kind of money on one player? I think it would be foolhardy if they go and do that.",
      "“When you look at Anderson, he is a high-energy player but there are a lot of high-energy players out there. To be in the Premier League now, it is about how athletic your team is. There is a lot better chance of getting results at weekends, gives you an advantage and opportunity, when you have got athletic players. Sunderland are proving that at the moment. One player for me in midfield is not enough. They need a major rebuild.”",
      "",
      "Man Utd are ready to ‘go all out’ to sign Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos after he left Mexican side Monterrey earlier this month, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places. Signing Vinicius Jr, Marc Guehi and Elliot Anderson in January should be enough for Ruben Amorim.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",

      "We toyed with the idea of including Yoane Wissa as his 17 minutes, no shots and 11 touches as a Newcastle player was almost enough to see him avoid bottom spot, but he will have to wait for the fourth version some time in the new year for this list to become the full 20.",
      "Here’s where the players ranked three games into the Premier League season and after nine games, with their previous positions included in brackets.",
      "All of his personal gripes with Newcastle and their ‘broken promises’ considered, along with the injustice surrounding the imbalance of power between clubs and players with regard to contracts, we can’t help but feel quite pleased he’s having an absolute mare at Liverpool, particularly given the consistently trotted-out reason for his struggles being his lack of fitness, which is entirely his own fault and surely, surely no longer a valid excuse.",
      "Any hope that the floodgates might open after his first Premier League goal against West Ham – a fine finish it was too – has faded dramatically with arguably even worse performances to strengthen claims that Isak might just be the biggest flop in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team, he was to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man.",
      "In just shy of 1000 minutes he has no goals, just two assists and has spent half the time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench.",
      "",
      "The abiding memories of Sesko’s contribution to English football so far are him stepping up 10th in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far, and getting injured when clean through against Tottenham.",
      "He’s taken to Liverpool like a duck to a frozen pond, expecting to swim but landing arse up with his face in the ice.",
      "Signed largely on the basis of his raiding attacking quality, Kerkez has one goal and no assists in 21 appearances this season and plays like he’s constantly trying to make up for mistakes he hasn’t made yet, but then duly does make in desperation to impress. He doesn’t know where to be or what to do so tries to be everywhere and do everything, and is therefore usually nowhere, doing nothing.",
      "",
      "He’s done some good things – a stunner against Wolves in the League Cup, a nice assist in defeat at Leeds – but still feels nailed on to be the next young forward to drown in stagnant pool of attacking talent that Stamford Bridge has become in the BlueCo era.",
      "He can at least take solace in Chelsea being a rung on the ladder to Arsenal, where inert young English wingers take their game to the next level.",
      "",
      "We were concerned for a while that Arsenal fans were becoming indestructible such was the way they brushed off perfectly valid criticism of Gyokeres on their seemingly inexorable path to the Premier League title.",
      "But the return of pessimism on the back of dropped points at Sunderland and Chelsea before defeat at Aston Villa saw their lead at the top of the table cut to just two points has granted us access once more to poke at the brittle Gunners psyche and Gyokeres’ frankly shocking form is the standout pressure point.",
      "He’s got six goals in 18 appearances for Arsenal and just one in his last 565 minutes of Premier League action.",
      "He (23.4) and Erling Halaand (22.6) are 442nd and 443rd respectively for touches per 90 this season as strikers who fail to contribute much aside from the goals they score (or are supposed to score).",
      "Haaland is scoring at a rate of 1.06 goals per game compared to Gyokeres’ 0.41, which begs the question as to why Arsenal didn’t sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin (0.42) when they had the chance.",
      "",
      "He enjoyed something of a hot streak in November, though what we’ve seen of Garnacho more recently suggests his goal against Qarabag and brace of assists against Wolves was more about the standard of opposition than any real indication of him blossoming at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of what looks to be a predictably frustrating season of infrequent highs from a base of lows.",
      "Wirtz has dropped down the growing list of Liverpool problems Arne Slot has to deal with, not least because he appears to be relatively low maintenance in comparison to others (or An Other).",
      "It’s not clear whether a slight uptick in his performances is down to Wirtz’s slow adaptation to the Premier League or if a guy with that much talent is bound to show glimpses of quality if afforded enough time on the pitch. We suspect the latter.",
      "But him not making the starting line-up for the huge clash with Inter on Wednesday isn’t a great sign of Arne Slot’s trust in a playmaker who needs to do a helluva lot more to ease doubts over his suitability to be the face of the New Liverpool in a post-Mohamed Salah era.",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves has been followed by not a lot besides from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality, but nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "He’s proven that he at the very least has the character required to avoid cowing under the pressure at Old Trafford as so many big-money signing have done before, but if we’re to tar all Manchester United forwards with the brush Roy Keane has used to claim Mason Mount is undeserving of a place in Ruben Amorim’s team then Cunha really needs to improve on his output after one (wonderful) goal and one assist in 13 appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank cruelly compared the Netherlands international to Florian Wirtz in October when asked about his struggle to adapt to life in the Premier League, and Simons did indeed look similarly short of whatever that thing is required to succeed in the English top flight, with the football happening around rather than through him.",
      "But a goal and an assist in the victory over Brentford and then a goal on Tuesday to help Tottenham see off Slavia Prague suggests that his teammates and – crucially – Frank now recognise his role and importance to Spurs being more than a second-balls outfit.",
      "Genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack after two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games has since faded into questions as to whether Pedro would even be in a Blues XI looking to challenge for major honours in future.",
      "While Liam Delap has so far failed to prove he’s the answer as the furthest man forward, he looks more suited to that role than Pedro, who thrives in a more withdrawn role which is sure to be occupied by Cole Palmer assuming Pedro Neto continues on the right flank.",
      "",
      "Started superbly with five goals and an assist in his first seven games to raise questions as to why Liverpool spent £125m on another striker, then endured a barren spell with no goals or assists in 12 games – largely off the bench – while Slot tried and failed to bed in his £125m striker, before he scored two goals against Leeds to again raise questions as to why they signed an alternative £125m striker.",
      "Liverpool shouldn’t have signed the £125m striker.",
      "",
      "His first Arsenal goal being the winner against his former club and his next three all coming against the Gunners’ bitter north London rivals whom he was days even hours away from joining instead of them all adds to what was an already pretty clear sense that Eze’s return to his boyhood club was meant to be.",
      "But those were his only four goals and the return of captain Martin Odegaard has put a bit of a dampener on things with Eze again forced out to the left flank where he still looks horribly uncertain of himself and ineffective in comparison to Gabriel Martinelli or Leandro Trossard.",
      "",
      "We may may never have been more invested in an Arsenal signing doing well after the #NOTOMADUEKE petition but are now struggling with the thought of those unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency being allowed to enjoy the football he’s playing.",

      "As suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet. While so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we’ve got a veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Woltemade thriving at St James’ Park with eight goals and two assists to his name.",
      "",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos and Mbeumo is chief among them. He’s got six goals and an assist, and looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",

      "Given how well Rashford has performed for Barcelona and Aston Villa over the past year, Spurs, especially for the fee involved, should snap Man Utd’s hands off if gifted the opportunity to land the England international.",
      "Spurs legend Waddle is against this potential signing, though his reasoning is somewhat flawed.",
      "“Spurs have failed to replace Harry Kane. They now seem to be too interested in only signing young players like Archie Gray, Lucas Bergvall and Wilson Odobert and trying to develop them. It’s about time they started signing ready-made players,” Waddle said in an interview with WhichBookie.",

      "So, Rashford is “better than what they have got”, but Spurs do not “need another left winger”… Eh?",
      "Spurs are not short of options in wide areas, but their current options are at a certain level and certainly worth being replaced with an upgrade if a player of Rashford’s ability becomes available.",

      "He also fits the bill as a “ready-made player”, even though Waddle thinks otherwise…",
      "“He’s not shown enough in the Premier League for Manchester United. He had one good season a few years ago, but apart from that he’s been quite inconsistent. I personally wouldn’t be trying to sign him,” Rashford added.",
      "“Spurs should be looking at somebody who is proven in this league. They shouldn’t be put off trying to sign players from other Premier League clubs who have performed well.",
      "“I know they’ll be doing their scouting far and wide across Europe and elsewhere, but sometimes I think they just need to buy somebody who is ready-made for the league and is already performing week in, week out.”",

He wants a project where he can grow, compete, and take on responsibilities, and that’s where Bayern Munich has the advantage.

      "A new report has explained why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been ‘bothered by’ two of his teammates this season.",
      "Mainoo‘s career has stagnated over the past 18 months as he has only been a bit-part player for Man Utd under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The talented Man Utd midfielder enjoyed a stunning breakout season during the 2023/24 campaign as he shone for club and country, but Amorim is clearly not a fan. He often prefers to select other players and the youngster has only had limited minutes.",
      "Mainoo reportedly requested an exit in this summer’s transfer window, but Man Utd denied his exit as they did nto want to leave themselves short of options in midfield.",
      "However, it has been suggested that the Red Devils could be more open to his exit in January as they are linked with several potential replacements, including Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher.",
      "READ: Semenyo to replace Salah at Liverpool as 10 likeliest January transfers ranked",
      "A new report from our pals at TEAMtalk and journalist Dean Jones claims Mainoo feels more inclined to leave in January than the summer because he has been ‘bothered by’ Joshua Zirkzee and Ayden Heaven ‘starting to become a more integral part of the first team recently’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Mainoo has been aware of Napoli’s interest for some time and realises he will have to play his own role in making any transfer come true.",
      "‘He requested a loan exit last summer but not not agitate for a move or cause problems behind the scenes. While there are no suggestions he’ll do anything drastic, it is believed he’ll push more forcefully for a move next month.’",
      "In the summer, Serie A giants Napoli appeared to be Mainoo’s most likely destination, though a report from The Daily Mail claims ‘at least 12 clubs are ready to take him on loan in January’.",
      "This is likely to include Premier League and European sides, but the report claims Napoli remain his ‘preferred’ destination as he could reunite with Scott McTominay.",
      "The report adds: ‘At least 12 clubs are ready to take Mainoo on loan in January if he is allowed to leave Old Trafford, but Confidential understands Napoli remain the player’s preference after United rejected his request to leave for the Italian club in the summer.",
      "‘The framework for that deal is still in place if United give it the green light, but the club would want to sign a replacement and the final decision rests with chief executive Omar Berrada, director of football Jason Wilcox and head coach Ruben Amorim.’",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the play-off round at worst – and with Chelsea the lowest of the six at 13th with two games to go any number of them could still wind up in the top eight – while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 106.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",

      "Total points: 73.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and could lose reigning Serie A champions Napoli from the Champions League before the knockouts. Roma and Bologna have pulled up few trees in the Europa and look set for the play-offs, and even the continent’s first true Conference League specialists Fiorentina have been a mixed bag there.",

      "Finished second in the list last year to scoop an extra place and will be right in the mix again, but are likely to lose a couple of Champions League teams before the knockouts with Villarreal and Athletic Club having thus far managed only one win and three draws between them. But the big three should all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night teams.",

      "Manchester United will sign a central midfielder and Antoine Semenyo should replace Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. It’s going to be an eventful January.",
      "We’re also expecting moves for Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick and Red Devils outcast Kobbie Mainoo, while there’s an outside chance Spurs lose one of their best players.",
      "In order of least to most likely to come off, we have predicted the 10 biggest transfers in the January transfer window.",
      "",
      "Very unlikely, isn’t it? But not completely out of the question. That’s good enough for us.",
      "Real Madrid need a new centre-back and Van de Ven is reportedly one of their top targets. The major issue is that he’d cost a fortune, and Los Blancos have plenty of cheaper options like Marc Guehi, Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahima Konate, though the latter is reportedly no longer an option because he is actually a bit s**t.",
      "If it weren’t for those three future free agents, Spurs would be in serious danger of losing Van de Ven to their least favourite customer.",
      "",
      "Arsenal are definitely keen on signing Elche youngster Mendoza, but there’s plenty of competition. Juventus are in the race. Manchester United are also there.",
      "He’s really established himself as one of Elche’s most important players and has a release clause worth a measly £17.5million, triggering Sambi Lokonga flashbacks. Just like the Belgian, he’s a young midfielder with sky-high potential who has broken into a decent team’s starting XI and is available for between £15m-20m.",
      "There’s a decent chance this transfer comes off… but an even bigger chance it happens at the end of the season, not in January.",
      "",
      "Chelsea need a goalkeeper. They also, somehow, still need a striker. But they probably need a goalkeeper more. You can’t change Robert Sanchez’s position or style, but Enzo Maresca can try lots of things to bring the best out of Joao Pedro.",
      "For some completely bizarre and unknown reason, Chelsea were stingy in their pursuit of Maignan last summer. It was blatantly obvious he would be an upgrade on Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen, yet they didn’t want to pay more than £13m. Milan wanting closer to £20m is completely reasonable; he’s an elite goalkeeper, but because he’s 30 years old and out of contract next summer, the Blues said no to a clear upgrade.",
      "They could right their wrongs in January, and we really think they should. But because Chelsea are a silly and unpredictable club, they probably won’t bother.",
      "",
      "Toney might actually be good enough to break West Ham’s striker curse. But with every Ivan Toney transfer link, Spurs must get a mention.",
      "Spurs could do with another No.9 if Dominic Solanke remains crocked, but if he can get back and compete with an in-form Richarlison, who has scored 17 goals in his last 24 Premier League starts, then Toney would be a waste of money.",
      "As for West Ham, they need a striker. Callum Wilson is doing a stand-up job, but he can’t be your first-choice striker in big 2026. Niclas Fullkrug is likely returning to Germany, and Toney would be a significant upgrade, capable of being the target man West Ham thought Fullkrug was, and the hard-working fox in the box Wilson was in his pomp.",
      "The rumours are there. Toney returning to the Premier League in January is a big possibility.",
      "",
      "Unfortunately for Manchester United fans, Mainoo doesn’t have a future under Ruben Amorim. It’s nothing to do with his conduct or even performances, but purely because he’s competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot.",
      "Napoli appears to be the most realistic destination for a player desperate for regular playing time. It worked for Scott McTominay, so it will work for Mainoo…right?",
      "",
      "Liverpool absolutely f**ked it by not signing Guehi from Palace last summer. It’s probably the biggest mistake any Premier League club has made this season. We’re not saying he’d have them top of the league, but the Reds would be a lot better off, that’s for sure.",
      "Arne Slot should not risk waiting until the end of 2025/26 to try and sign the Eagles captain on a free transfer with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich among the clubs circling. They should be ruthless in January to ensure they get their man. And we actually think they will.",
      "",
      "Despite Mainoo’s lack of minutes, it’s quite likely United will offload him and sign Gallagher, potentially on loan, despite Gallagher arguably being a worse player.",
      "Gallagher has a bigger engine and is much more versatile than young Mainoo. He definitely suits Amorim’s system more and is capable of playing with Fernandes rather than fighting a battle that’s impossible to win.",
      "There’s definitely no smoke without fire here, yet it’s unclear if United and Atletico will negotiate a loan or permanent transfer. A loan probably suits the former, while the latter will prefer to sell. Ideal, then.",
      "Amorim needs a new central midfielder and is also targeting Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. Gallagher represents a much cheaper alternative, and someone whose true transfer value won’t be massively inflated in January.",
      "",
      "Semenyo leaving Bournemouth in January is almost guaranteed, but to who, Chris Kamara?",
      "Liverpool are the favourites but won’t like that Manchester City are interested. Spurs are as well, but that’s far less intimidating. Apparently Semenyo likes Arsenal, but Arsenal have too many forwards right now, so that makes little sense.",
      "So yes, it’s going to be Liverpool.",
      "After spending over £400m in the summer, the Reds are oddly light in attack and, after an incredible Mohamed Salah meltdown, now need to sign a starting right-winger. Not a back-up to the Egyptian. An actual replacement.",
      "There are more appealing options than Semenyo, like Michael Olise, but the Bayern Munich star is never leaving in January. So Semenyo for his £65m release clause will have to do, taking Liverpool’s season expenditure to the £500m mark. They can’t finish outside the Champions League spots after that, FFS.",
      "",
      "Endrick has a gargantuan 11 minutes played for Real Madrid this season despite being available for selection. Xabi Alonso clearly doesn’t fancy him and a loan exit in January is guaranteed.",
      "French club Lyon are expected to be the lucky benefactors of Endrick’s lack of minutes, though other clubs, including Manchester United, have also been linked.",
      "",
      "There is a chance Salah is reintegrated into the Liverpool team after losing his mind following three consecutive Premier League starts on the bench. It was such a reasonable reaction to such disgusting treatment, wasn’t it?",
      "After the Africa Cup of Nations, Salah is off. He’s gone. His Liverpool career will reach a very sad conclusion.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been trying to sign him for years, and they’ll surely finally get their man. Salah’s inflated ego might get in the way. Maybe he fancies staying in Europe, but who will take a punt on him? It’s all very Cristiano Ronaldo in 2022.",
      "And the result of that Ronaldo drama was a pride-swallowing, albeit very lucrative, transfer to Saudi Arabia.",

      "Manchester United could become the perfect destination for young talents at major clubs who are struggling to break into the first team.",
      "Players like Ethan Nwaneri and Endrick simply aren’t playing enough, and for all of United’s issues in recent years, they would still represent an ambitious and exciting move for any prospect.",
      "A recent report – believe it or not – claims Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Arsenal wonderkid Nwaneri and wants to take advantage of the Gunners’ need to sell a valuable player after spending over £850million across the last five summer transfer windows.",
      "Nwaneri is one of five young players at big clubs who could be vulnerable to a Manchester United approach – including another Hale End graduate and a Real Madrid starlet.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s top transfer priority is signing a new central midfielder, but if a player with Nwaneri’s potential becomes available and is open to a transfer, you absolutely have to be all over it.",
      "Right now, Nwaneri’s pathway into the Arsenal starting XI is blocked by some outstanding players. He signed a new contract earlier this year and will have been briefed on the club’s transfer plans, but there’s no doubt he would have been promised more than one start across 21 Champions League and Premier League games.",
      "The 18-year-old has certainly taken his Carabao Cup chances, playing every minute as Arsenal knocked out Port Vale and Brighton, scoring against the latter in a 2-0 win.",
      "But he has played only 20 minutes across Arsenal’s last eight league matches and has been an unused substitute eight times. Yes, he’s young, and yes, he has still logged significant minutes for someone his age in a team as strong as Mikel Arteta’s, but there comes a point where you wonder whether your long-term future lies in a squad containing Ebere Eze and Martin Odegaard. He’s not starting ahead of either of them if they’re fit.",
      "Nwaneri has played most of his minutes on the right wing, but it appears one of the promises made to him was the chance to feature more centrally, with Noni Madueke’s arrival all but confirming that.",
      "Nwaneri would fit very nicely as one of Ruben Amorim’s wide 10s, which is a hybrid between a right winger and an attacking midfielder: the two roles that best suit him. It’s almost a position made for him. We’re not sure he has the work rate or defensive instincts to play as a wing-back, and that Arjen Robben-style cut-in onto his left foot is irresistible.",
      "United would need to cough up a significant fee to sign one of Hale End’s most exciting recent graduates, and if he does leave Arsenal, they’ve got his younger brother ready to break through, because of course they do.",
      "",
      "From one Hale End prodigy to another, could Lewis-Skelly boost his England chances by switching to Manchester United?",
      "Naturally a central midfielder, the 18-year-old has played all his senior football at left-back, and he’s actually very good there. Good enough to break quickly into the England team and keep an injury-prone Riccardo Calafiori out of the XI for most of last season in both the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "Those minutes and performances in 2024/25 are leaving people baffled by his reduced playing time this term, but they should actually be the reason everyone calms down. He’s only 19 and has already played the workload of a 21-year-old. It’s hardly a disaster that he hasn’t started as much now Calafiori is fit and flying, though the Italian’s poor outing at Aston Villa could open the door again.",
      "Lewis-Skelly loves being at Arsenal, and a lack of minutes this season won’t change that. What could change that is genuine interest from Manchester United.",
      "He could use his left-back experience to become a very useful midfield option in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. He has the engine, the technical ability, and the defensive grounding, albeit from a different role and against different types of players. Left-wing-back is also viable, and there’s no doubt he would be an upgrade on Patrick Dorgu, even if the Dane is an Amorim signing and only 21 himself.",
      "It’s a long shot, but what a signing he would be for United.",
      "",
      "We move away from Arsenal but stay in London as we assess George’s chances of leaving Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford.",

      "Most of George’s minutes last season came in the Europa Conference League, and that pattern has continued, making four appearances in Chelsea’s six Champions League matches, including starts against Benfica and Qarabag. But as the competition progresses and Chelsea raise the stakes, it’s unlikely he’ll continue playing significant European minutes. He didn’t get off the bench in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat at Atalanta – Chelsea’s biggest Champions League game of the season.",
      "He hasn’t made any of Enzo Maresca’s last six Premier League matchday squads and was almost sold to Fulham in the summer. A departure in 2026 feels inevitable.",
      "George is less of a sure thing than Lewis-Skelly or Nwaneri, but the talent and ceiling are obvious. His ability to play across the frontline makes him valuable, and he could operate effectively on either flank under Amorim.",
      "A January move makes less sense given United have no European football to help integrate him, but they should be back in continental action in 2026/27.",
      "There’s no doubt Old Trafford would be a far better environment for his development than Chelsea, who literally tried to sell him a few months ago.",

      "When Levi Colwill returns from injury, there’s a chance Acheampong becomes a forgotten man at Stamford Bridge. Again. There were discussions about selling him last summer, but Colwill’s ACL injury changed everything.",

      "The 19-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and would likely cost a significant fee, but there’s a good chance he’d be worth every penny. Considering his potential, Chelsea would likely want at least £30million. But with the size of their squad, they may feel inclined to accept a semi-reasonable offer.",
      "United already have a few good young centre-backs in Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson, though the latter feels more like an emergency option. Acheampong would come in as the second-best of the group behind Yoro, or debatably first, ahead of the Frenchman.",
      "Fredricson is a promising 20-year-old who played in the latter stages of last season, which only underlines the need for more defensive depth.",
      "Harry Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, though reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim want to keep him longer, so there’s a strong chance United invest in a new central defender next summer. Why shouldn’t it be Acheampong?",
      "",
      "And why shouldn’t Manchester United throw their hat into the ring for Brazil and Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick?",
      "It’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense. Endrick’s idol is Sir Bobby Charlton. He is struggling to break into the first team at the world’s biggest club, and there is clear interest from one of the world’s top three most iconic clubs.",
      "Amorim has some stellar attacking options now; Mason Mount is impressing, Benjamin Sesko will return from injury, and Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are settling in well, but the Portuguese head coach could still do with more attacking depth, even if signing a central midfielder is the top priority.",
      "There is reportedly interest from Lyon, with Madrid understandably preferring a loan for the 19-year-old. But United could throw a cat among the pigeons by making a cheeky enquiry.",
      "Endrick wants to become Brazil’s main man, and that’s impossible when he has played just 11 minutes for Real Madrid this season. He has been an unused substitute 15 times!",
      "A loan move in January seems the most likely outcome, but of all the players mentioned here, Endrick will have the shortest patience and is surely the most fed up…by a country mile.",
      "This would be a statement signing for United, and it’s a pretty realistic one as well.",

      "Much like Aston Villa probably didn’t consider the prospect of making sure to not even accidentally use Harvey Elliott in five more of their possible 41 games in all competitions for fear of Liverpool coming calling for a £35m bill, Unai Emery likely didn’t intend to lie to the player’s face on what was presumably their first meeting.",
      "“All the best,” said the Spaniard in a video posted to the club’s social channels after the summer transfer window closed. “All the best for you, because then all the best is for us as well.”",
      "Their “all the best” has been the worst-case scenario for a 22-year-old who has not featured since October 2 or even made a Premier League matchday squad since October 19.",
      "If anyone would be forgiven for ranting to the media about their perceived poor treatment, it’s the player who left Liverpool in search of more game time and has somehow contrived to find even less. Elliott has been thrown under the open-top bus parade Villa are presumably planning for their upcoming Treble.",
      "But he would ultimately have no leg to stand on with his complaints. While it is curious that Villa committed to such a deal for a player they have almost immediately discarded, any questioning of Emery’s decisions or methods can be counteracted by the results, the performances and the ongoing transformation of a mess he inherited three years ago.",
      "The manager’s fundamental argument, before contemplating the tactical intricacies and other specifics, is that “there are other players performing very well”.",
      "Emiliano Buendia has, in a nutshell, completely f**ked everyone over this season. There is even a Ross Barkley-shaped spanner in the works that few might have foreseen.",
      "But also ahead of Elliott in the pecking order for the positions behind Ollie Watkins is another Big Six loan cast-off who is quietly proving his worth.",
      "Jadon Sancho still has not started a Premier League game for Villa. He was a substituted substitute in his longest top-flight appearance for them so far, and sits uncomfortably between Marco Bizot and Victor Lindelof in terms of minutes played for the club in all competitions this season.",
      "Just a fortnight ago it was written on the BBC that borrowing Sancho and Elliott was ‘looking like expensive mistakes for everyone’. But their situations are not even close to comparable. The former has maximised his scant opportunities in a way the latter has been unable to do.",
      "There was inevitable social media mockery over the original 007 reprising his role with another cameo in which he neither scored nor assisted against Arsenal. But his impact was clear: in the quickly-taken throw-in which maintained Villa pressure before the goal; in his nimble footwork and pass in the build up; in his back-post header which prompted a scramble and ultimately forced the winner.",
      "In the 133 minutes Sancho has spent on a Premier League pitch this season – against Arsenal, Manchester City, Sunderland, Liverpool and Bournemouth, as well as Leeds and Wolves, Aston Villa have scored four times and not conceded once.",
      "Only Ethan Nwaneri – with eight goals for and zero against during his on-field time for Arsenal this season – has a better such record.",
      "It is humble progress for one of the worst Manchester United signings who actual Chelsea spent £5m specifically not to make their problem, but Emery is using Sancho to form some of his Villa solutions.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Elliott, whose reserve-rotting remains a strange sub-plot in this remarkable campaign.",
      "Villa took a burden off Manchester United with no strings attached beyond this season, and might have already seen enough to make him their own in the summer. They stole a potential jewel from Liverpool with an obligation to buy and are – much like Chelsea did with Sancho – desperately checking the fine print for a way out.",
      "At least Elliott knows now that “all the best” is not actually a binding commitment for a prosperous life together.",
      "Sources close to both Marc Guehi and Liverpool believe they know what the final outcome will be after Bayern Munich interest.",

      "This has seen the Man Utd centre-midfielder have a major fall from grace since his sensational breakout season for club and country in 2023/24.",
      "Amorim is clearly not a huge admirer of Mainoo as he mostly selects Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield, while the England international has limited minutes from the bench.",

      "Thursday 11 December 2025 23:12, UK",
      "Manchester United's controversial cost-cutting measures under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are reflected in an operating profit, as the club released their results for the first quarter of the new financial year.",
      "The headlines from the latest report include:",
      "Chief executive officer Omar Berrada said: \"These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men's and women's teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and Women's Super League respectively.\"",
      "The total revenue is down two per cent from the first three months of the last financial year, with other revenue streams also reporting individual losses.",
      "But these are very small reductions in each case, nothing too significant for a club and business the size of Manchester United.",
      "But crucially, despite all those revenue streams reducing, Man Utd's operating profile went from a loss of £7m a year ago to a profit of £13m now.",
      "It shows that Man Utd have been cost-cutting right across the business, and doing it effectively. This includes redundancies and other cost-cutting measures to reduce their cost base, but this has not proven popular in some areas of the club.",
      "\"It's not huge changes in the figures from a year ago, and this won't make any difference to the club's approach to the upcoming transfer window.",
      "\"Whilst Berrada has hailed the robust' financial figures, and pointed out in this financial statement that Man Utd are 'committed to, and complying with, the Premier League's PSR rules' - the truth is, Man Utd don't have huge money to spend, and it is much more likely they will save their big transfer investment until the summer, rather than pay what would likely be inflated fees to try to land some of their targets in January.",

      "December into January always exposes fragility within a camp and Chelsea are showing the same cracks that appeared this time last year, when they stumbled through the Christmas period without a win in four including losing at Ipswich.",
      "Enzo Maresca is a process manager but the caveat with those types is clear - his teams are best when fresh. As Chelsea boss his record of 15 wins from 20 matches when his teams enter a game after five days or more between fixtures, tells that story.",
      "Give him time and the performances pop. Take away the rest? It all becomes hard work.",
      "The Club World Cup, Champions League travel and commitments, an emotional load on a young squad is all leaving a mark. You can see it in their late-game legs in the recent defeats to Atalanta and Leeds.",
      "Everton, on the back of four wins in five, should arrive buoyant and confident of an upset with the 11/4 with Sky Bet on the draw no bet or the 6/5 on the double chance offering some tasty value to bite on.",
      "Taking the opposition shots lines against Liverpool at Anfield isn't usually a betting theory to explore - but under Fabian Hürzeler, Brighton are not a normal team when visiting the elite and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shots bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 10 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under this manager's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 16.1 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.78 expected goals per game. That is outrageous output. That is title-contender chance creation from a side that aren't sniffing anywhere near a title challenge.",
      "Brighton consistently punch holes in high-pressing, high-line systems because Hurzeler refuses to change his principles. The reward? Buckets of shots and a puncher's chance of a result.",
      "We can jump on Brighton to register 12 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "A key edge to exploit in betting card markets revolves around the referee appointment. Prices lean heavily on team and league averages while one of the most influential factors - the referee - remains oddly under-weighted in how odds are compiled.",
      "Sky Bet have pitched under 3.5 cards at 10/11 here - a fair line based on the averages - but referee identity is everything in this market and Michael Oliver radically changes the story.",
      "Oliver is a fascinating case study this season.",
      "Once one of the Premier League's stricter enforcers, he has taken a notable turn toward a more hands-off approach. Whether that's a conscious stylistic evolution or simply the natural rhythm of the matches he's overseen, the data tells us he's averaging just 2.3 cards per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season.",
      "Finding value when a team is priced at heavy odds-on is an art-form that the best gamblers out there can consistently nail. Arsenal are 1/10 to beat Wolves with Sky Bet - a price that tells you the market sees this as little more than a formality.",
      "There are ways to turn short-odds juggernauts into something far more backable. And adding a goals angle is often the cleanest route, as we have done with success this season on Arsenal. Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.67 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 14 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too.",
      "This is how they operate. They strangle games, not stretch them, so this one looks unlikely to get out of hand for Wolves.",
      "Crystal Palace have managed to score seven goals in the last four meetings with Manchester City, so the both teams to score angle is lighting up like a Christmas tree - but the market is fully aligned at a very skinny 4/9 with Sky Bet.",
      "However, there is a smarter way to attack this angle.",
      "The sharper play regarding goals is to back the players who score them better than anyone else in the Premier League in Erling Haaland and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who as a pair can be backed at 100/30 to both find the net through the BuildABet function with Sky Bet.",
      "Haaland feels like a cheat code most weeks, but it's the other name on the ticket that unlocks the price. Mateta has quietly transformed from cult figure to legitimate Premier League hotshot, and the numbers back it up. In 2025 the two most prolific strikers in the Premier League are Haaland (23 goals) and Mateta (17).",
      "Nottingham Forest are still having issues defending set-pieces.",
      "Eleven goals conceded from such situations - the joint-most in the Premier League - paints a pretty ugly picture, but the deeper numbers are even more damning. Forest are allowing a goal from a set-piece once every six shots they face from those scenarios.",
      "And if you're looking to find value in Tottenham matches, set-piece angles remain a fruitful way to do it. Thomas Frank takes this part of the game very seriously - the master of the marginal gain and with seven Premier League goals from corners this season, it puts Spurs second that particular metric behind Arsenal with eight.",
      "Cristian Romero scores goals like he defends - with commitment, aggression and a hint of melodrama. Spurs have increasingly tailored their deliveries to target him as the first contact and he bagged twice in the 2-2 draw with Newcastle. At 15/2 with Sky Bet he's worth a swing in the anytime goalscorer market.",
      "But the underlying numbers? They're waving a big red flag. According to Opta's expected points model, Sunderland should be 19th - behind Wolves.",
      "If you repeatedly win tight matches while flirting with losing the underlying battle and then lose matches by a big number on the metrics, it usually means an overperformance is occurring. It is here.",
      "Strip away the emotion, the vibes, the narrative fluff, the Granit Xhaka love-in and the Black Cats' performances put them second-bottom in the metrics that usually matter most when it comes to assessing overall performance level.",
      "And when a team's results and numbers stretch this far apart, that elastic tends to snap at some point. It could do here, where Newcastle look the call at 5/4 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo and Unai Emery have crossed paths nine times as managers across the Premier League and LaLiga. And on eight of those nine occasions, both teams have scored. Different squads, different countries, different contexts but the same outcome of goals.",
      "Emery's obsession with vertical runners and brave build-up, up against Nuno's knack for soaking up pressure but always offering a threat on the break often produces a game where both teams have enough space to land a punch.",
      "Under Nuno, the Hammers are still working through some growing pains, too. The spirit has improved, the structure is taking shape, but the balance isn't quite there. Six of West Ham's last seven games have seen both teams score. It should land again with the draw also looking a big runner.",
      "Combining both those angles yields a 3/1 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "In the world of player fouls markets, edges don't last long. A tactical shift here, a role tweak there and suddenly a player who usually draws one cheap free-kick a game is being clattered at a much higher rate. The trick is catching the moment before the market does.",
      "And that's why Dominic Calvert-Lewin to be fouled at least twice at 5/4 with Sky Bet is a bet to consider.",
      "The recent change in Leeds' approach to a far more direct style in their last three matches, funnelled straight into Calvert-Lewin, has completely altered the foul dynamic around him. He's the target for long diagonals, flick-ons and contested duels and he's drawn six fouls drawn in his last two-and-a-half appearances for Leeds.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, aren't shy about contact and their centre-backs defend aggressively meaning this price on Calvert-Lewin is a value call.",
      "There are certain annual traditions you can set your watch by as Christmas comes into view. Mariah Carey defrosting after 11 months of inactivity and Andoni Iraola teams becoming very difficult to beat.",
      "Under Iraola, Bournemouth have played 14 Premier League games in December, losing just two, while winning seven and drawing five.",
      "His high-intensity, high-repetition style tends to hit peak sharpness as other teams begin to creak under the festive fixture pile-up. Bournemouth's broader form supports the case for them too.",
      "They're unbeaten in four meetings with Manchester United and stylistically they're one of the worst types of teams for Ruben Amorim's side to face in that they are full of energy, are tactically drilled and relentless in transition.",
      "United are still swinging between being functional and fortunate still. But one thing that is consistent is how unreliable they are. Bournemouth draw no bet at 2/1 with Sky Bet it is.",
      "1pt treble on: Everton double chance, Arsenal to win & under 3.5 goals & under 3.5 cards in Fulham vs Burnley (7/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "Roma are interested in taking Joshua Zirkzee from Manchester United on loan in January; Zirkzee wants to stay at Old Trafford to fight for his place in the squad; United are not actively looking to sell Zirkzee in the winter window; Ruben Amorim; Zirkzee has featured in the last two games",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Kaveh Solhekol",
      "Wednesday 10 December 2025 16:29, UK",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wants to stay at Manchester United to fight for his place in the squad amid interest from Roma.",
      "United are aware of the interest but are not thought to be actively looking to sell Zirkzee when the transfer window opens - and he has recently made an impact in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",
      "The United forward has a contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2029, with the option of another 12 months.",
      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",

      "Diogo Dalot wasted a one-on-one, while Sam Johnstone also saved from Mbeumo before Casemiro robbed a dallying Andre and the ball was worked to Fernandes who had time to slip over and still get to his feet to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper.",
      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",
      "\"We scored four but had a lot of shots. I cannot make that connection with being more clinical. We improved a lot.",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
