      "Michael Carrick speaking to TNT ahead of Man Utd's match against Spurs.",
      "Michael Carrick has confirmed his Benjamin Sesko plan for Manchester United's Premier League clash against Tottenham. Despite scoring the winner against Fulham last weekend, he has been named on the bench again but Carrick still expects him to have an impact.",
      "He told TNT Sport: \"Ben’s been fantastic. He’s going to be a big player for a long. I've been really impressed by him and everything I’ve seen from him is really encouraging. It was a huge moment for him last week and I'm sure he will have more of those.",
      "\"Today was just a decision I’ve made but Ben will come on and make a big difference for us again.\" Following his decisive strike in last Sunday's win at Old Trafford, Sesko was a dominant topic at Carrick's pre-match press conference with the United interim head coach making his feelings perfectly clear.",
      "He said “Huge moment [for him to score a winner at the Stretford End. I’m so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room told us everything. Confidence, it wasn’t so much that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "\"He’s been fantastic, we’ve worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He’s bright in training, he’s looked dangerous, he’s done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, has done a lot of work one-on-one with him.",
      "\"Ben’s a big talent, he’s got so many positive things. And today’s a huge goal because that feeling as a striker to score a winner in front of the Stretford End late like that, it’s what you dream of.",
      "\"After missing the chance, which is what it is, strikers miss chances, to go again and put that away. Absolutely so, so pleased for him. He really deserved it.”",
      "It has not been an easy start to life at his new club with injury striking in the reverse fixture against Spurs. He was absent for the following four Premier League games before returning off the bench against Bournemouth in mid-December.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has scored four goals from his last four appearances(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "He failed to find the back of the net in his next four starts under Ruben Amorim, but he scored three times during Darren Fletcher's brief run in temporary charge.",
      "With more attacking options available after returns from AFCON for Bryan Mbeumo and Amad, he has been forced to play reduced minutes. The former has been starting as the centre-forward under Carrick, but Sesko has come off the bench in two of those games.",
      "United only have the Premier League to focus on which likely means he will have to settle for more substitute appearances.",
      "However, given the swift turnaround between the visit of Tottenham and trip to West Ham next Tuesday, he could be handed a start at London Stadium especially if he shines off the bench again.",

      "But Carrick, who spent two-and-a-half years at Middlesbrough before being relieved of his duties last summer, says his thoughts on the future haven't been changed by results.",
      "\"Nothing's changed, no,\" he said in his pre-match press conference this week. \"To be honest, it's not going to change what I do or how I feel about it. I think I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got.",

      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick faces another of his former clubs in the hopes of maintaining his 100 per cent record at the Old Trafford helm. And Tottenham will be eager to get one over on their ex-midfielder after he said he was \"desperate\" to leave them for the Red Devils.",
      "Despite one previous short-lived stint as caretaker chief of United, Carrick is building a different legacy in his new interim role. The former England international has won three from three in charge of the club to date, having beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Fulham.",
      "This year will mark the 20th anniversary of Carrick's £18.6million transfer to the Theatre of Dreams. The West Ham academy graduate spent just two season with Spurs before Sir Alex Ferguson took notice and plotted a deal to obtain his signature.",
      "And Carrick was seemingly only too happy to do his part in materialising the move. So much so that there won't be many concerns regarding divided allegiances when Tottenham make their way to Manchester in Saturday's early kick-off.",
      "\"I went to the World Cup with England and information was filtering through that clubs were in contact,\" said Carrick in 2010. \"Tottenham told me what was happening, but it seemed to drag on and on.",
      "\"I was desperate to come. It was a no-brainer for me as soon as I found out United were interested. The first time I spoke to the manager was on the phone when the move was all sorted. I’ve never been so nervous about getting a phone call in my life. I’d heard the rumours about him, and I was scared stiff. That phone call will stay with me for the rest of my life.\"",
      "His motivation was well-placed, it turns out. Carrick became an instant hit at United and made a career-high 52 appearances as he won the Premier League in his first season at Old Trafford, then completed a league and European double in his second term under Ferguson.",
      "Michael Carrick has intimate knowledge of both United and Spurs from his playing days(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He collected a total of five Premier League winners' medals at United, along with a Champions League, FA Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and three League Cups. He eventually hung up his boots at Old Trafford in 2018, having made an impressive 464 appearances across 12 seasons for the club.",
      "And his contributions may not stop there, at least if the beginning of his time as interim boss is anything to go by. United have looked nigh-unstoppable under his command, winning a Manchester derby on debut before two dramatic victories over Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Carrick spent two seasons at Tottenham before completing an £18.6million transfer to Manchester United(Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)",
      "Those latter two results were rescued thanks to late goals from Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, the likes of which were somewhat common during the Ferguson era. And it stands to reason that the squad has been able to resurrect some of that never-say-die attitude under someone who saw Ferguson work his magic up close.",
      "United come into Saturday's contest sat fourth in the Premier League and looking to cement their place in the race for Champions League qualification. Carrick is sure to have some sympathy for Tottenham, meanwhile, as they seek to climb from 14th in what's been a rough campaign for Thomas Frank.",

That figure, submitted through New Orleans-based Lancer Capital, makes them one of the highest bidders out of nine competing parties.",
      "They are also in the running to buy Rajasthan, whose process is one step ahead of Bengaluru’s, with a second round approaching. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) rules don’t allow multi-franchise ownership, so, if they are successful, the Glazer family may have to choose between the two franchises.",
      "The Cricket Monthly reported that the Glazers’ bids for the Ahmedabad and Lucknow franchises in 2021 were the lowest of all the contenders. The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group bought the Lucknow team after submitting an offer in excess of £686m, while the Titans went to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for £541m.",
      "The Glazers seem eager not to miss out this time, with the IPL having gone from strength to strength commercially as the world ’s biggest and most lucrative T20 league.",
      "Royal Challengers Bengaluru won the IPL for the first time in 2025(Image: Pankaj Nangia/Getty Images)",
      "It was also reported that Avram Glazer – the family member keenest on expanding into cricket – wanted to leverage the Manchester United brand in the sport. Sheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the son of the ruler of Dubai, tweeted in March 2022 that he’d met Avram and had discussed “the UAE T20 Cricket league's launch in Jan 2023 featuring Manchester United cricket team & other teams.”",
      "That idea didn’t get off the ground due to copyright issues, but the Glazers haven’t been deterred from pursuing cricket as an avenue. The IPL move isn’t the only reported consideration in India, either, with Indian cricket legend Sourav Ganguly revealing in 2022 that the Glazers had held talks about taking over Indian Super League side East Bengal.",
      "The Glazer family has owned United since 2005 and have been extremely unpopular for the majority of that time. They sold a 26.2 per cent stake to Sir Jim Ratcliffe for £1.3bn in February 2024 and the British petrochemicals billionaire is now responsible for the day-to-day running of the Premier League side.",

      "The 18-year-old has been named on the United bench for eight matches this season, having impressed in brief appearances against Villa, Burnley and Brighton in the FA Cup. Despite receiving a yellow card against Brighton, he was warmly applauded by supporters as he left the pitch.",
      "Lacey may continue to find himself among the substitutes in the weeks ahead. But Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already vying for just three attacking spots.",

      "Rio Ferdinand endured a night to forget for Manchester United in 2006(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "David Bentley has claimed his iconic hat-trick against Manchester United led to a nightclub confrontation with Rio Ferdinand. The 41-year-old played a starring role as Blackburn Rovers earned a memorable 4-3 win at Ewood Park in February 2006.",
      "The former Arsenal starlet had started the season on loan at Blackburn under manager Mark Hughes. The then-21-year-old agreed to make his move permanent in the January transfer window, sealing the deal on the eve of the club’s clash with United.",
      "Rovers raced into a 3-1 lead during the first half. Bentley opened the scoring by tapping home a rebound from a free-kick and later helped his side regain the lead by pouncing on Rio Ferdinand’s flicked header back after miscommunication with goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. A Lucas Neill penalty rounded off the scoreline at the break.",
      "In the second half, Bentley showcased his quality with a swerving half-volley into the far corner. A brace from Ruud van Nistelrooy failed to salvage a point for Sir Alex Ferguson's side, who were reduced to 10 men after a late red card for Ferdinand. According to Bentley, his post-match comments also frustrated the defender, who sought him out in a nightclub.",
      "\"It was Rio, wasn’t it, I said something. You know what, there’s a story about that. So Rio headed it on to Van Der Sar and I nipped in,\" Bentley recalled to Clutch 9 Powered by Betway.",
      "\"My agent Rob Segal, he’d set up a Sky interview for the day after. That’s what they do, don’t they, get you out there. I’d said a joke about Rio but he got the right hump! Me and him had a little bit of a square up in a nightclub in Manchester over it.",
      "\"He didn’t like it because he thought I’d disrespected him. I went, ‘I just want to say thanks to Rio, nice little flick-on.’ He got the hump. Everyone used to be in this same nightclub and he came up and we had a little bit of a dance around for a bit.\"",
      "Remarkably, his hat-trick would be the only league goals Bentley scored that season but he still played a key role as Blackburn finished sixth to earn a UEFA Cup spot. Meanwhile, United came second to Chelsea, finishing eight points behind Jose Mourinho's side.",
      "David Bentley scored a hat-trick against Manchester United the day after signing permanently for Blackburn Rovers(Image: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)",
      "The winger continued to produce stellar performances for Blackburn over the next two seasons. England boss Steve McClaren labelled Bentley the “new David Beckham” but the Rovers star was made to wait for his senior international debut after controversially withdrawing from U21 duty.",
      "As a result, Bentley was jeered by some England fans when earning his first cap as a substitute against Israel. However, in a full circle moment, it was Ferdinand who leapt to the winger’s defence.",
      "\"We had such a good performance and everyone was quite happy but what happened with David left a bad taste in the mouth,\" Ferdinand said. \"The lad is on England duty and you don't expect him to get booed, no matter what has happened in the past.",
      "Ferdiannd and Bentley later became England teammates(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)",
      "\"In some quarters, people might say what he did in the summer was a wrong decision but in hindsight, it is easy to say that. He is a young lad, on a learning curve, making his seniors debut for England and he did not deserve to be booed.\"",
      "Bentley completed a high-profile move to Tottenham Hotspur in 2008 but failed to hit the same heights in a Spurs shirt, eventually losing his place to Aaron Lennon. The seven-cap England international was subsequently loaned out to several clubs, including Birmingham City, West Ham United and Russian outfit Rostov.",
      "He made a brief return to Rovers during the 2012/13 season, featuring on seven occasions for the Championship side. Bentley was released by Spurs at the end of the campaign and confirmed his retirement a year later, aged 29.",

      "Manchester United take on Tottenham Hotspur this weekend, aiming to maintain their winning streak under interim head coach Michael Carrick. The Red Devils have triumphed in all three matches under the ex-midfielder's guidance, sparking optimism for Champions League football at Old Trafford next season.",
      "Carrick's squad will welcome Tottenham to their home ground in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off (12.30pm). Ahead of the match, they occupy fourth place in the league standings, a single point ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea.",
      "Tottenham currently find themselves in 14th position, but managed to claw back from a 2-0 deficit at half-time to secure a 2-2 draw with Manchester City in their previous match last weekend. In the run-up to the Old Trafford clash, both managers have provided updates on their squad's availability.",
      "Carrick shared worrying news about Matthijs de Ligt. The central defender has been absent from the last 12 games across all competitions due to a back issue.",
      "Carrick confirmed that the upcoming match will come 'too soon' for the player. \"Matta [De Ligt], he's working his way back, taking good steps and improving,\" the United interim manager stated in his pre-match press conference. \"It's a little bit too soon at the moment but, hopefully, it won't be too long [before De Ligt is back].\"",
      "He could be joined on the bench by midfielder Mason Mount, who missed the victory over Fulham after picking up an injury in training. This puts his participation in this weekend's match into serious doubt.",
      "\"Probably, Mason [will be available] sooner [than De Ligt],\" Carrick said. \"He's not too far away really. We're hopeful it won't be too long.\"",
      "Another player set to miss out is full-back Patrick Dorgu. He picked up a hamstring problem during the match against Arsenal.",
      "Speaking last week, Carrick confirmed that the setback would sideline him for 'a few weeks'. The Danish defender had been performing impressively for United since the interim manager's arrival, making his absence a significant setback.",
      "As for Tottenham, they continue to grapple with an extensive injury list. There remains uncertainty surrounding striker Dominic Solanke's fitness, after he was substituted during the stalemate with City due to an ankle problem.",
      "Patrick Dorgu will miss Manchester United's match against Tottenham through injury(Image: Justin Setterfield, Getty Images)",
      "Whilst Solanke's participation remains in doubt, nine players are confirmed absentees for the fixture.

      "On a more positive note for Spurs, boss Thomas Frank has confirmed that centre-backs Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero will be fit for the encounter with United. They could potentially be accompanied by full-back Djed Spence.",
      "\"So Micky is good, [he] trained today,\" the Spurs boss stated. \"He is available for selection for Saturday.",
      "\"So it's good. Djed Spence is getting closer. It will be a little bit touch and go, but there is a good chance that he will be ready.\"",

The winning streak has propelled them back into the Premier League's top four, sitting five points adrift of third-placed Aston Villa.",
      "Since returning to United, Carrick has introduced several modifications. On the field, he has adapted Amorim's strict 3-4-3 system and brought Kobbie Mainoo back into the first XI.",
      "Away from the pitch, Carrick has chosen to address his squad after matches, something Amorim rarely did, according to The Athletic. Whilst he reserves the in-depth tactical breakdown for subsequent days, Carrick has made a deliberate effort to engage with his United players in the changing room, with certain feedback given on a one-to-one basis in another move away from the Amorim era.",
      "This follows reports that Carrick has abandoned Erik ten Hag and Amorim's approach of making United players train the day after fixtures. Carrick has instead introduced mandatory rest days within 24 hours of matches, with recovery work now scheduled to occur two days following the final whistle.",
      "Carrick has chosen to dismantle several of Amorim's approaches whilst introducing his own methods and philosophy. Amorim had decided to prohibit players from taking holidays during international breaks and banned food from being brought into the changing room.",
      "The former Sporting CP manager even prevented his own coaching staff from delivering detailed tactical instructions to his United players.",
      "Carrick has also reduced the length of training sessions but increased the intensity of drills. He has altered the time his squad arrives for fixtures, both when travelling for away matches and home games at Old Trafford.",
      "Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to life back at Manchester United(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "His modifications have proved effective, with United gaining momentum and appearing well-placed to compete for a Champions League spot. Next up for the Reds is a fixture against Tottenham on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Despite Spurs having failed to win any of their last five Premier League matches, Carrick is anticipating a \"big challenge\" from Thomas Frank's side. \"They certainly bring a challenge,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"The way they finished the game the other day, they've had, over a period, players injured, a lot of changes to the team which makes things more difficult. They're getting players back, they have really good attackers that look to stretch the backline and play forward and attack the box an awful lot.",

Spanish reports this week suggested that the La Liga champions are now ready to make Rashford's move permanent.",
      "The 28-year-old's loan stint at Camp Nou is set to end when the season wraps up, but he has already admitted that he hopes to extend his stay with the Spanish champions. Earlier this month, rumours indicated that the Catalan giants were reluctant to pay the previously agreed fee for a permanent deal, offering United two alternatives: signing Rashford for a lesser amount or extending his loan for another season with a compulsory purchase in 2027.",
      "But that position seems to have drastically changed now, as according to Spanish publication Sport (via Sport Witness), Barca have decided to buy the England international, a decision that will only be altered if he suffers a serious injury.",
      "Flick and Deco are believed to have 'argued' that it's 'virtually impossible' to find a player of Rashford's calibre for €30m (£26m). And the report also claims that the forward is ready to lower his salary to align with their wage structure amid the club's well-documented financial issues.",
      "Rashford has netted 10 goals and provided 13 assists for Barcelona so far this season, and when asked about joining the Catalan giants permamently back in October, he said: “Oh yeah, for sure.

      "Michael Carrick has implemented several changes already at Manchester United(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "Michael Carrick's Manchester United revolution has seen him transform the club both on and off the pitch after just three weeks at the helm. The legendary former United midfielder was appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season in January.",
      "He replaced the recently sacked Ruben Amorim, whose miserable 14-month spell in Manchester ended seemingly following disputes with the club hierarchy over tactics and transfer business.",
      "Since taking charge, the 44-year-old has secured three wins from three fixtures, restoring hope at United and delivering football that reflects the club's 'DNA'. A convincing 2-0 win in the Manchester Derby was followed by a 3-2 victory away at league leaders Arsenal, before securing a late winner against Fulham last weekend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Both Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag required players who featured in games to attend the training ground the following day for recovery work. Carrick has scrapped this rule, instead granting designated rest days within 24 hours of a fixture. Recovery sessions have now been rescheduled to take place two days after the final whistle.",
      "Amorim enforced a rigid 3-4-3 system and was unwilling to stray from his approach, despite his squad being better equipped for a more conventional formation. That meant dropping certain players, including academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, from the first team.",
      "However, a crucial element of Carrick's transformation has been scrapping the 3-4-3 shape and reverting to a more traditional United-style 4-2-3-1 with fast-paced wing play. He has also brought fan favourite Mainoo back into the starting eleven.",
      "Training was very different under Ruben Amorim(Image: Crystal Pix/MB Media, Getty Images)",
      "Amorim prohibited food from being taken into the dressing room after emphasising the need to improve player fitness standards, potentially affecting team morale in doing so. Carrick is understood to be scrapping that policy by transforming the dressing room into a haven for players, where they can feel valued.",
      "He has introduced a new philosophy that players must not leave the dressing room until they feel they have been addressed and listened to, by speaking to players immediately after matches. Harry Maguire is reportedly someone who will spearhead this approach and become an influential voice.",
      "That's a departure from Amorim's tenure, where players were supposedly dismissed after matches, frequently without him addressing them, to allow emotions to settle before making hasty decisions. He would then share his views the next day as it afforded him an opportunity to further analyse aspects of the match and provide a measured evaluation once the heat of matchday had subsided.",
      "Amorim reportedly prevented his own coaching team from delivering complex tactical instructions to the players in order to maintain simplicity. Carrick has changed the coaching structure, allowing for a different flow of information and instruction.",
      "Players have been impressed by the more direct involvement of Carrick and his staff in contrast to Amorim, who participated but sometimes chose to watch rather than intervene.",
      "Manchester United players now arrive later to matches(Image: Getty)",
      "A minor adjustment Carrick has made is having his players arrive at Old Trafford for fixtures slightly closer to kick-off time. The different pre-match routine has been brought in to try to freshen things up, with Amorim being strict on earlier arrival times ahead of fixtures.",
      "For the Premier League victory against City, the team bus turned up around 15 minutes later than normal. This was a deliberate change by Carrick to prevent his players from waiting around in the ground ahead of kick-off, while also guaranteeing his squad received a strong reception.",
      "Carrick has reduced the length of training sessions but raised the intensity of the drills undertaken, with a focus on tailored one-to-one coaching as well. Under Amorim, training sessions were longer but were lower in intensity and had different tactical focuses.",
      "It is believed Carrick made the change to stress the importance of performing at one's best each day. Reports suggest the energy in training is now a far cry from that under Amorim, with Carrick aided by two new assistant coaches in Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate.",
      "Carrick is trusting players like Kobbie Mainoo (Image: Getty)",
      "Amorim left fans and former players frustrated by appearing to overlook the club's gifted youngsters who had progressed through the academy. While the Portuguese manager did hand opportunities to players such as Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Ayden Heaven, he also publicly criticised them, alongside Mainoo, which seemed unusual for a United boss to do.",
      "Carrick, in contrast, has already shown a stronger commitment to providing young players with opportunities and engaging with the club's academy more broadly. He recalled youngsters such as Habeeb Ogunneye from loan and Joe Hugill to train with the first team.",
      "He's also been spotted watching youth team fixtures - something Amorim was criticised for neglecting - which will reassure academy prospects that there is a genuine route to the first team.",

      "He was notably left out of the side as they took on Al-Riyadh on Monday and he is considering also sitting out for Friday’s clash with Al-Ittihad.",
      "Saudi bosses have now responded to Ronaldo’s grievances and have claimed that every club run under the PIF banner is run independently. A spokesperson said: “The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules.",

Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.",

      "Michael Carrick didn't sign anyone in January but is fortunate to still have one of Manchester United's best winter transfers at his disposal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window was a quiet one for Manchester United, but the silver lining behind that is that a more productive summer may be around the corner.",
      "Michael Carrick didn't bring any new signings to Old Trafford last month and emerges from the window with the same squad he inherited. That's despite the fact that some of the club's all-time best signings just so happen to have arrived in the winter.",
      "Based on his fast start at the United helm, Carrick may just get the chance to conduct business for his old side in the future. And if all goes to plan, he'll still be at the helm at the start of 2027 to have his first real crack at January dealings",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Arguably one of the greatest January signings in Premier League history, Nemanja Vidic emerged from relative anonymity at Spartak Moscow to become one of the finest defenders the Premier League has witnessed. The Serbian joined for a modest £7million in January 2005 and claimed his first trophy with United after barely a month, defeating Wigan Athletic to secure that season's League Cup.",
      "Vidic's legacy at Old Trafford is nothing short of remarkable - 15 trophies, including five Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't mince his words when describing the Serbian's consistency, whose legendary defensive partnership with Rio Ferdinand became the stuff of United folklore.",
      "\"I always used to say Denis Irwin would give us eight or nine out of 10 every week, but he never got a mention when the praise was being given out,\" the Scot said in 2009. \"We all knew the value of him, and it is very much the same with Vidic. He has been a fantastic performer for us.\"",
      "Few fans may have known Nemanja Vidic's name when he arrived in England, but they certainly did by the time he left(Image: Alex Livesey, Getty Images)",
      "Few United supporters would dispute Paul Scholes' status as a club legend. However, many overlook the extraordinary fact this one-club hero technically signed for the Red Devils on more than one occasion.",
      "At 36, Scholes hung up his boots in the summer of 2011. Yet Ferguson sensed his midfield maestro had unfinished business - and his instincts proved spot on. The ginger genius made a sensational return halfway through the 2011/12 season, netting four league goals in the latter half of the campaign, his best tally since 2006/07.",
      "Despite United narrowly missing out on the title as City dramatically snatched the crown on goal difference, Scholes stayed put to claim his 11th and final Premier League trophy in 2013. However, he later confessed he felt the comeback was a misjudgement.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best January recruit of the modern era(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "The only member of this list still on the books at United, Bruno Fernandes ignored interest from other European big guns to sign in January 2020. And the former Sporting CP playmaker has succeeded in lifting the standards at the Theatre of Dreams, just as he did in Lisbon.",
      "Some will say the jury is still out on whether Fernandes has justified the initial £47m paid for his services given an FA Cup and League Cup is all they've lifted in the six years since he arrived. However, his 88 goals and 77 assists in 268 appearances for United, and the fact he was made captain in 2023, speaks volumes of his work.",
      "Fan favourites don't get a lot more beloved than Patrice Evra, who supposedly snubbed interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Real Madrid to join United. Five Premier League titles, one Champions League crown and 379 appearances later, the Frenchman had secured his spot as an Old Trafford icon.",
      "Ferguson moved for Evra in January 2006 because of an injury crisis in defence at the time, but his £5.5m arrival soon looked like a steal. Evra ousted Gabriel Heinze from the left-back spot permanently and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season on three occasions.",
      "Patrice Evra was an understated signing under Sir Alex Ferguson but went on to become an all-time great(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "United icon Ferguson had a knack for poaching the Premier League's most prolific goalscorers from rival clubs, and Louis Saha's signing in January 2004 exemplified this perfectly. The French striker had netted 15 goals for Fulham in the opening half of that campaign and arrived to bolster United's attacking options.",
      "Whilst Saha's spell at Old Trafford was hampered by fitness problems, he still managed a respectable tally of 42 goals and 16 assists across 124 appearances for United. As one of Wayne Rooney's preferred striking partners, he delivered what was required when available and secured two Premier League titles, one League Cup and a Champions League winner's medal for his efforts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United's Premier League clash with Tottenham at Old Trafford.",
      "United head into the contest in fine form having won all three of their games since Michael Carrick took caretaker charge following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. The Reds have climbed into the top four of the table as a result and a win today will move within two points of Aston Villa in third ahead of the rest of the weekend action.",
      "Carrick must decide whether to start Benjamin Sesko in attack after he scored a dramatic late winner against Fulham last time out. The Slovenian striker has been on the bench for all of Carrick's games in charge so far but will be pushing for a start.",
      "United remain without Patrick Dorgu and Matthijs de Ligt while Mason Mount is also expected to miss today's clash. Kick off at Old Trafford is 12.30pm and you can follow all the build-up, reaction, action and analysis on the blog so stay with us.",
      "Tottenham just worked the ball forward well to create a decent chance for Gallagher.",
      "Billiant pressing from Fernandes, who sprinted from the front and forced Tottenham into losing the ball.",
      "Cunha looks sharp. He just pleased the crowd with a cheeky backheel and was involved in a slick move around the box. He placed his hands on his head when it came to nothing.",
      "Same team for United but one noticeable tactical shift. Cunha is playing through the middle today, with Mbeumo out on the left. Cunha dropping deep but doing so from more of a central position.",
      "Beautiful tributes to those who lost their lives at Munich, as is always the case at Old Trafford. A new ‘Busby Babes’ banner in the Stretford End, a poignant airing of Flowers of Manchester and then Michael Carrick and Thomas Frank lay a wreath on the side of the pitch. Always a touching and emotional occasion.",
      "Early chance for Mbeumo fired over the bar after a pass from Fernandes.",
      "We're under way at Old Trafford, so follow throughout for live match updates",
      "It was a beautiful day in Manchester this morning, but the rain is now coming down.",
      "Fernandes will wear a Munich tribute armband today.",
      "We're just 15 minutes away from kick-off at Old Trafford.",
      "A 25th Premier League start in a row for Shaw today. It’s comfortably his longest run of successive starts and something nobody would have seen coming at the start of the season. He’s been one of United’s best and most reliable performers this season. The easier schedule has certainly helped him but he was good under Amorim and is now enjoying being back at left-back as well.",
      "Sesko is on the bench again this afternoon.",
      "Mbeumo has been one of United’s best players this season and even though they ended up paying more than they wanted for him, he looks value at an initial £65million, with a potential £6million in add-ons. That fee was driven up by Thomas Frank leaving Brentford for Tottenham and urging his new club to try and hijack Mbeumo’s move. The forward only had eyes for Old Trafford but it did cost the club a bit more to get him. None of that will be a concern now and the best way to pay it back today will be to score against his former Bees boss.",
      "Tottenham have been shocking in the Premier League this season, but they finished fourth in the revamped Champions League table phase, and there were signs of life in the second half of their game against City last weekend. Solanke scored a brace and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium found its voice again. United are the correct favourites to win today, however, the game will not be a penalty kick. Spurs appear to be slowly turning a corner and have gone eight games undefeated against United, their longest run in history.",
      "Tottenham are unbeaten in their last eight meetings with United in all competitions (W5 D3). It’s their longest ever run without defeat against them, while in the 21st century only Chelsea have gone longer against United (12 between 2012 and 2017).",
      "Tottenham are without Porro, Danso, Davies, Bentancur, Bergvall, Maddison, Kudus, Kulusevski and Richarlison today. Their starting XI is decent, but they don't have much depth on the bench, which could be the difference. Carrick has named an unchanged team, which is not a surprise. It felt like the right thing to do was to invite Sesko for a chat and explain he will start against West Ham on Tuesday.",
      "An entirely predictable team selection. There was only one place up for debate and even that was a minor one. Sesko can feel a little hard done by but surely he will get a start soon. You can see how things settled are at the moment by the fact that there is only one change in the entire matchday squad, with T. Fletcher coming in for Lacey.",
      "XI | Lammens, Dalot, Maguire, Martinez, Shaw, Casemiro, Mainoo, Fernandes (c), Amad, Mbeumo, Cunha.",
      "Subs | Bayindir, Heaven, Malacia, Mazraoui, Yoro. T. Fletcher, Ugarte, Sesko, Zirkzee.",
      "We'll confirm the team news in 10 minutes.",
      "What to make of Tottenham? Is there a more confusing club in the Premier League. As United know all too well, they won the Europa League last season despite finishing 17th domestically. Despite sacking Ange Postecoglou and appointing Thomas Frank, they are down in 14th this season, but somehow ended the league phase of the Champions League in fourth. They haven’t won a league game yet in 2026 but it did feel like they were building some momentum last week when they rallied from 2-0 down to draw with Manchester City. Sir Alex Ferguson once famously said, “lads, it’s Tottenham”, to inspire his players to victory, but Spurs are now eight games unbeaten in matches against United. That is a remarkable turnaround.",
      "It's been brilliant to see Mainoo send a reminder of his quality since Carrick reintegrated him into the starting team. The 20-year-old covered more ground than any other United player against City and Arsenal. He was important against Fulham, making the most tackles in the game and winning six of his seven duels. There have been some concerns about Mainoo's out-of-possession work, but he's made those critics look daft.",
      "In my eyes, there is only really one selection debate to be had today, and that is whether Sesko comes in after his match-winner against Fulham a week ago. The striker delivered off the bench and now has four goals in his last four appearances. He is pushing hard for a start and it does feel likely he will start either today or against West Ham on Tuesday. Maybe it will be the midweek fixture and Carrick will opt for an unchanged team today.",
      "Carrick writes in his programme notes:",
      "“Ben’s late goal was a great moment, and everyone was delighted for him. He’s extremely dedicated and has responded really well to everything that we’ve worked on with him in the last few weeks.”",
      "It is three weeks since Michael Carrick’s Manchester United reign started with a 12.30pm kick-off on a Saturday lunchtime. It’s fair to say things could hardly have gone better. Carrick is looking to make it four wins in a row today and if he does that it will be United’s longest Premier League winning run in two years. Another victory would strengthen his own case for getting the job beyond the end of the season and it felt this week like he was starting to dream about that for the first time. “I feel at home here,” he said. He looks it as well.",
      "United are the favourites to win this afternoon.",
      "United vs Spurs odds",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "In his pre-match press conference on Thursday, Carrick confirmed Mason Mount was progressing well with his recovery from injury but this weekend may be too soon for his return.",
      "Long-term absentee Matthijs de Ligt will miss out again. With the Dutchman absent, Carrick will more than likely stick with the centre-back partnership of Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez that has worked so well recently. Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw can continue in the full back roles.",
      "Here's our predicted XI",
      "Elsewhere, it was a quiet deadline day. As expected there were no incomings and no first-team departures either, setting the club up for a busy summer, which is the subject of some of the questions today.",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions",
      "Michael Carrick said he \"feels at home\" back at Manchester United and is loving life as the club's latest head coach, but is refusing to get carried away over the possibility of staying on beyond the end of the season. Carrick signed a contract until the end of this campaign when replacing Ruben Amorim, but he has won his first three games in charge, including wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, to move United back into the top four.",
      "The 44-year-old will be looking to make it four wins in a row against former club Tottenham today and after seven months out of the game after leaving Middlesbrough, he looks relaxed back in the spotlight at Old Trafford. But he insists that run of victories hasn't changed his or the club's plans, with United determined to conduct a thorough search for a new head and Carrick happy for that process to continue.",

      "Michael Carrick has restored Kobbie Mainoo to the Manchester United team",
      "If there was concern for the future of the Manchester United academy while Ruben Amorim was in charge at Old Trafford, the club's prestigious record of blooding young players is in safe hands while Michael Carrick is around. Amorim's relationship with the academy wasn't a particularly strong one and his absence from games and sidelining of Kobbie Mainoo invited mistrust.",
      "In three weeks, Carrick has shown a very different approach. He has attended two Under-21 games and an FA Youth Cup tie, and Mainoo has played every minute of his three games in charge.",
      "Mainoo's renaissance has been one of the stories of Carrick's return to the dugout. The jewel in the crown of the United academy, he is set to be offered a long-term contract that reflects his status as a key player in the first team and any concerns that he might have to leave have disappeared.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The 20-year-old was weighing up a loan move at the start of January, having failed to start a single Premier League game under Amorim this season, but he is firmly back in the picture now and contract talks are back on the agenda.",
      "Carrick restored Mainoo to the team because he knew he needed what the Stockport-born youngster could offer, but the 44-year-old is also steeped in United's traditions and although his contract is only until the end of the season, he has been a visible presence around the academy.",
      "This week, he included 15-year-old forward JJ Gabriel in first-team training, even though he is too young to appear in the Premier League this season. He also called up 17-year-old full-back Yuel Helafu, twins Jack and Tyler Fletcher, 18, and 20-year-old midfielder Jack Moorhouse.",
      "Carrick's focus on delivering Champions League football for United this season might prevent him from handing out many appearances to those young players, but over time, he is determined to see more of the club's academy graduates given their chance and believes there is nothing better than giving a young player their opportunity.",
      "\"We want more, we want more players to come through the system and to get into the first team,\" said Carrick. \"For me, there's no better feeling than giving younger players a chance. He's [Mainoo] taken the chance over recent weeks and I am sure he will continue to do that.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Obviously, with Munich and the kind of the foundation of the football club, everything feeds off that. I'm not putting everything on Kobbie's shoulders, he's doing terrific at the moment and I'm sure he'll continue to be that way.\"",
      "United's record of including an academy graduate in every matchday squad now extends into an 89th year, although there were times under Amorim when you did fear how much longer it would last and whether it would become a tick-box exercise.",
      "That is no longer the case. Mainoo is in the team on merit and Shea Lacey has also become part of the first-team picture in recent weeks.",
      "Lacey, 18, was handed six minutes of football under Amorim and was an unused substitute in seven of the eight occasions he was named on the bench. Darren Fletcher gave the winger minutes against Burnley and Brighton and he was back in the squad under Carrick last weekend.",
      "\"I think from the club's point of view, there's an ideal scenario to bring players through the academy and have them in the team and have them go through their career at this club, staying in and around it,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"I think I was fortunate enough to be with a lot of players that managed to do that, and I think it's important.\"",

      "It will be interesting to see if Casemiro can play both games this week, but he will definitely start this one, with Mainoo next to him to continue a midfield partnership that has offered a really encouraging balance.",

      "Michael Carrick and Steve Holland have struck up a good dynamic at Manchester United",
      "Michael Carrick said he \"feels at home\" back at Manchester United and is loving life as the club's latest head coach, but is refusing to get carried away over the possibility of staying on beyond the end of the season. Carrick signed a contract until the end of this campaign when replacing Ruben Amorim, but he has won his first three games in charge, including wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, to move United back into the top four.",
      "The 44-year-old will be looking to make it four wins in a row against former club Tottenham today and after seven months out of the game after leaving Middlesbrough, he looks relaxed back in the spotlight at Old Trafford. But he insists that run of victories hasn't changed his or the club's plans, with United determined to conduct a thorough search for a new head and Carrick happy for that process to continue.",
      "\"I'm fully aware of the role I'm doing here and the responsibility I've got,\" he said. \"We want to be successful. I want the club to be successful beyond the end of the season: if that's me, if that's somebody else. At this stage, I can't control that, and we'll see what happens.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"The results over a short period of time don't change that. If they have changed that, there is something wrong.\"",
      "Carrick has refused to push his own credentials in public since he stepped into the role in January, but he did admit ahead of the Old Trafford fixture with Tottenham that he was enjoying the experience.",
      "\"I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm here, I feel at home here, but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away,\" he said.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick's start to life back at the club is all the more impressive given he had to build a coaching staff in a matter of days, with Amorim's backroom team all departing with him.",
      "He turned to former Chelsea No.2 and England assistant Steve Holland and brought Jonathan Woodgate with him after working together at Middlesbrough. Jonny Evans was recruited by United before Carrick was appointed and Travis Binnion stepped up from his role in the academy.",
      "The dynamic has worked so far, with 55-year-old Holland earning plenty of praise from the players. He has had a long and distinguished coaching career and is a United fan, having grown up in Stockport.",
      "He was recommended by Carrick's brother Graeme, who worked with Holland while he was at the Football Association, and the decision now looks an inspired one.",
      "\"I think when talks were progressing and it looked like I might be coming in here, I was spending some time thinking about what the staff might look like,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"Having conversations with my brother actually, of what it might look like. And we ended up mentioning Steve. He knew him from the FA and I have come across Steve a number of times, fully aware of his experience and his quality as a coach as well as a person. It ticked a lot of boxes, and it kind of just went from there.",
      "\"I spoke to Steve and we clicked straight away. He's had vast experiences in different scenarios. Being at Chelsea for so long, being successful winning trophies, knowing what it takes, different style, different managers, different types of players.",
      "\"He's had a real good knowledge and backstory to pick at. We speak a lot about different things, all of us, all the staff.\"",
      "Holland spent eight years at Chelsea and worked under Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, Rafa Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink and Antonio Conte, earning a wealth of experience at a club that regularly changed managers.",
      "Carrick also worked under Mourinho when he moved into coaching at United, with the Portuguese gifting the retiring midfielder an old whistle and a packet of headache tablets when he hung up his boots at the end of the 2018 season.",
      "\"Jose I learned a lot from in the five months when I was coaching,\" said Carrick. \"When you see how he works, how he thinks and how he sees players and things end up coming off that he predicted at certain times. So he had a real good eye for that.",
      "\"There's certainly that connection [with me and Steve]. I wouldn't say it's totally me and Steve with Jose, but it's definitely common kind of factors that help us work together, for sure.\"",

      "Our senior Manchester United writer Tyrone Marshall has been answering your questions",
      "Elsewhere, it was a quiet deadline day. As expected there were no incomings and no first-team departures either, setting the club up for a busy summer, which is the subject of some of the questions today.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Is Sandro Tonali a real option for the summer?",
      "I've not heard anything to suggest he is yet, but then the situation around Tonali developed quickly on deadline day. His agent threw the cat amongst the pigeons, suggesting there is some long-standing interest from Arsenal.",
      "United want a couple of midfielders, but if they go for one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba, I think they will look abroad for a second. Signing players from Premier League rivals is an expensive business and given the interest in Anderson, that could be a very big deal to do.",
      "Will more youngsters like Shea Lacey be given a chance?",
      "It's hard to see that happening at the moment. Lacey is the one knocking hardest, but the first-team squad is in good shape again in terms of fitness, and there aren't enough games to go around to give those players a chance, never mind a youngster.",
      "Lacey might get games on the bench still, but Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already four players for three spots.",
      "The other youngster to maybe keep an eye on is Jack Moorhouse. He returned from a loan spell at Leyton Orient on deadline day and has trained with the first team this week. If there is an injury in midfield, he might get a chance.",
      "Why didn't we sign a midfielder this summer?",
      "Because no long-term target became available. United were adamant they wouldn't make any short-term moves and they stuck to their word.",
      "It might be a risk not to sign a midfielder, but there are only 14 games left and any deal would have been to add back-up. I'm not sure it was really needed.",
      "There are some long breaks coming up between fixtures and Carrick has his work cut out to keep everyone happy as it is. If Casemiro or Mainoo get injured, then maybe it will look like a mistake, but for now, I don't think it was really necessary.",
      "Will Carrick get the job full-time if he gets us into the top four comfortably?",
      "You would have to think there is a chance. United insist the process is going to be thorough and Carrick is keeping his feet on the ground, but a top-four finish makes a strong argument for him.",
      "It's not impossible that United even reel in Aston Villa for third. If Carrick continues to impress, then he will probably give himself an excellent chance of a Premier League job next season, whatever his Old Trafford bosses decide.",
      "The question then might be whether they are prepared to let him go and shine elsewhere. There is a lot more football to be played this season, but Carrick's start has put him firmly in the frame.",
      "Is there a young midfielder who could replace Casemiro?",
      "I don't think there is, to be honest. There are some good youngsters coming through, but nobody in midfield that you would say is on Kobbie Mainoo's level and ready to make an impact.",
      "Moorhouse might get a chance and Jack Fletcher has already, but I'd be surprised if either was in the first-team squad next season. Sekou Kone is someone whom United have high hopes for, but the 20-year-old needs to do plenty of developing in Lausanne in the second half of the season.",
      "What are the chances that if we continue like this we can take the title?",
      "Who says people are getting carried away? In truth, I'd say the chances are non-existent. The gap is 12 points and even if United win their remaining 14 Premier League games, Arsenal would need to lose four. They have had a wobble recently, but that just isn't going to happen.",
      "A more realistic target would be to try and catch Villa. That gap is now five points and Unai Emery's side still have to come to Old Trafford, while Thursday night football is also still on the agenda for them in the Europa League.",
      "Villa are statistical outliers this season when it comes to their data and you can see their results starting to match up with their performance levels at some point.",

Mainoo has returned to the team under Michael Carrick, starting all three games for the 44-year-old head coach after a spell in the wilderness under Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the 20-year-old shining in the victories against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham, United have made it clear they intend to resume talks over a new long-term contract with Mainoo, with the hope that an agreement can be reached relatively smoothly.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",

      "While he was hitting plenty of them during his early time with the squad, he wasn't triggering them when he was benched by Amorim. His return to the team has again led to his salary rising due to the bonuses in his contract.",

That was difficult to do when he fell out of favour under Amorim, but he has again proved his worth over the last three weeks.",

      "Michael Carrick had never previously met Thomas Frank until they sat down together for a chat in front of the Amazon Prime cameras in September, spending more than half an hour discussing their football philosophies and swapping coaching advice.",
      "The meeting at Spurs Lodge was to preview Frank's first Champions League game in charge of Tottenham against Villarreal, but the 52-year-old Dane and the 44-year-old from the north east struck up a bond as they got into the weeds of coaching.",
      "Frank had just swapped Brentford for Tottenham, while Carrick was doing TV work after leaving Middlesbrough last summer. At the time, there seemed to be no immediate prospect of the latter returning to the dugout anytime soon.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But then came the call from a club he can't say no to. Carrick might have grown up near Newcastle and spent two years as a player at Tottenham, but it is Old Trafford that he now calls home, and when Manchester United made contact in January about the prospect of returning as head coach to replace Ruben Amorim, he jumped at the chance.",
      "Carrick signed a contract until the end of the season, but after three wins in his first three games, including victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, he is now the favourite to be in charge next season as well. There is enough football left in this campaign for that to change, but another win on Saturday against Frank's Tottenham will further strengthen his case.",
      "And whatever happens at Old Trafford, the more Premier League games that Carrick wins, the stronger his own case of getting a job in the top flight becomes. Victory against his former club could even open a door back in north London.",

      "Frank has steadied the ship at Tottenham recently, but he remains under pressure. Supporters are unconvinced by his style of play, and although they finished fourth in the league phase of the Champions League, they are 14th in the Premier League.",
      "Defeat at Old Trafford would be unlikely to be terminal, but as things stand, it's hard to see Frank regaining enough credit to survive beyond the end of the season. If Tottenham do pull the trigger, could they turn to Carrick for 2026/27?",
      "That will become a possibility if he continues to be successful at United. Guiding a team that looked flat under Amorim into the Champions League places would look good on Carrick's CV, and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that they could yet catch Aston Villa or Manchester City.",
      "The question for United could become whether they are prepared to let Carrick leave and walk into a different Premier League job. If the football hierarchy at Old Trafford looks elsewhere despite Carrick's success, only for him to then thrive at a different club - such as Tottenham - it could be an awkward look.",
      "For Carrick, there is no doubt where he would rather be. He made 75 appearances for Tottenham and is still popular there, but speaking on Thursday about leaving White Hart Lane for Old Trafford, he made it clear United struck a different chord for him.",
      "\"It was pretty instant,\" he said of his love affair with United. \"I've got really fond memories of Tottenham and being at the club. I was there for a short time, or what feels now like a short time when you look back, but I really enjoyed it. It was a good team, Martin Jol was the manager, and there were a lot of things that I learned at the club in that short period of time.",
      "\"But I've said it enough times. I think coming here was a jump, and a big jump at the time, and I certainly felt that pretty quickly, and then I think once you step inside this place as a footballer, then it kind of turns you. So pretty much from the first day walking into the dressing room, meeting the manager from then on in, that was me.\"",
      "Carrick's near-three-year stint at Middlesbrough had come to a natural end in the summer and he looked in no rush to return to coaching until the offer from United came. In just over three weeks, he has rediscovered a love of being on the grass and working with players.",
      "He has also enhanced his job prospects, and this weekend he could open up another opportunity for himself in the Premier League.",

United scored a measly 44 goals in 38 Premier League games and those figures contributed to a 15th-place finish.",

The Suffolk club may have been relegated back to the Championship at the first time of asking, but Delap's 12 goals in the Premier League showed signs he could make the step up and retain his place in the top flight, even if his team didn't.",

      "He also had the right profile for the attack Ruben Amorim was looking to build: tall and athletic, with the ability to hold the ball up and an eye for goal. A £30m release clause saw United try to persuade him to move to Old Trafford, but in the end Chelsea were seen as a more enticing option and United had to go back to the drawing board.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joined to strengthen United's attack but the Reds were still missing a focal point at the top of the pitch. Viktor Gyokeres chose Arsenal so with options running out, United turned to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Younger than both Delap and Gyokeres and without experience of English football, it was a gamble to spend an initial £66m, which could rise to £72m, to bring the forward in. Indeed, it may still be a gamble that doesn't pay off, but there have been signs of promise.",
      "Liam Delap has struggled since joining Chelsea(Image: PA)",
      "Both Delap and Gyokeres have proven to be unwise additions for Chelsea and Arsenal respectively. Delap has struggled with just two goals in 21 appearances for his new club.",
      "Sesko has six in 21. While this is by no means golden boot form either, the Slovenian has at least shown more promise than Delap and has a higher ceiling for improvement.",
      "His goal on Sunday against Fulham could be a huge turning point. Bouncing back from hitting the post shortly after coming on, Sesko showed brilliant composure to win the game for United in stoppage time. He may have cost them £36m more than Delap would have done but in the long-term this could be money well spent.",

      "The remembrance ceremony at Old Trafford on the anniversary of the tragedy has grown each year. United show their class on February 6, and some in the crowd had tears in their eyes.",
      "Reverend John Boyers, former United club chaplain, led proceedings in typically dignified fashion. Boyers was valued by Sir Alex Ferguson, was the chaplain at Gary Neville's wedding and discussed racism with Paul Pogba. Boyers retired eight years ago, but feels it's an honour to still lead the remembrance service.",

      "\"We all gather once more to recall and reflect, we will remember with solemnity those killed in the tragic accident on that slushy Munich runway, on a cold, grey afternoon in 1958,\" said Boyers.",
      "\"Today is a solemn and serious remembrance of that tragic part of Manchester United's history, but we also want to reflect on what followed, and how the club rebuilt itself to achieve European success within 10 years.\"",
      "United boss Michael Carrick attended the service alongside members of his backroom staff, Steve Holland and Jonny Evans. Bruno Fernandes laid a wreath alongside women's team captain Maya Le Tissier.",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, and Jason Wilcox, director of football, were there to pay their respects. Staff members from each United department attended, along with representatives from the different academy teams.",

      "Van der Sar knew the importance of the disaster when he was a player. \"I was aware of it, of course. The Manchester boys, like Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, they told us the importance,\" he said.",
      "Journalist Andy Mitten spoke after Rev Boyers' opening remarks. Mitten spoke about unearthing new Munich-related stories, 68 years on, and how Karl-Heinz Rummenigge reflects on the disaster.",
      "\"Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are fantastic at remembering. Let's not forget tiny Bishop Aukland as well,\" he said during his speech. \"Alongside the giants of Red Star Belgrade, Manchester City and Liverpool. But that's enough compliments to those two clubs for this afternoon.\"",
      "Annie Marsh and Harry Oliver Harper, representatives from United's Under-13 teams, bravely stood on stage and read a poem written from Sir Matt Busby's viewpoint. Other youngsters joined the stage during the service. United are conscious of teaching the history of the disaster to future generations.",
      "Sammy McIlroy recalled growing up in Belfast and how he learned about the crash. McIlroy said his schoolteacher \"loved United\" and was \"absolutely heartbroken\" by the disaster.",
      "McIlroy explained that Mr Norman liked to pretend he was Sir Bobby Charlton when they played football at school. Charlton miraculously survived the Munich Air Disaster and was at the heart of United's rebuild.",
      "\"The Red Devils will rise again,\" Jimmy Murphy said just a few days after the crash. “It will again be a long, tiring job to rebuild the Red Devils. This time, we have to start practically from scratch. But we'll do it.\"",

      "Martin reflected on his 20th year of singing The Flowers of Manchester at a remembrance service, saying that when he started, it was just him and a microphone, and \"people walking past.\"",

Diomande only turned 19 in November but is already attracting the attention of some of Europe's biggest clubs.

      "Manchester United spent the January transfer window keeping their powder dry as they stuck to their long-term approach to signings. Ruben Amorim's departure at the beginning of the month ensured this was an easier sell than it might have otherwise been, with few expecting an interim head coach to let loose in the transfer market.",
      "It was also a decision that became more palatable with the fans as Michael Carrick started to get a tune out of the players at his disposal. Three straight victories over Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham have reduced calls for reinforcements, as have the returns of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui from AFCON.",
      "However, the Reds did flirt with the possibility of making one major reinforcement. Antoine Semenyo was the man in demand during the opening stages of the window and United were willing to spend £65m to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In the end, the Ghana international chose to move to Manchester City. That decision meant the transfer funds were locked away for another few months. But while United chose not to move for an alternative forward in January after missing out on Semenyo, this does not mean the Reds have abandoned the hunt entirely.",
      "It is understood RB Leipzig left winger Yan Diomande is on the Reds' radar ahead of the summer transfer window, with Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain also monitoring the youngster. Diomande only moved to the Bundesliga club last summer but major European teams are already starting to sniff around the forward.",
      "The 19-year-old has bagged eight goals and six assists for Leipzig this season and having broken into the Ivory Coast's national team in October, he has already scored three goals for his country, including one against Burkina Faso at AFCON.",
      "It was while Diomande was at the tournament in Morocco that he earned the seal of approval from Amad. Having enjoyed a rapid rise, United's winger has forged a good friendship with the teenager which could become useful at the end of the season.",
      "When asked about Diomande, Amad said: \"We’re very close off the pitch, so that makes things easier on the pitch. If I have the opportunity to pass to him, I pass to him; if he has the opportunity to pass to me, he passes to me.",
      "\"Yan is a very good player, everyone knows that.\" While it may seem trivial to some, having a player in your camp with an existing friendship with a transfer target might well help your cause.",
      "You only have to look back to the summer and Andre Onana's role in bringing Mbeumo to Old Trafford. The goalkeeper worked to convince the former Brentford man United was the right place for his next career move.",
      "Should United pick up the phone for Diomande in the summer and the forward wishes to seek advice, he may well speak to Amad. Carrick might not be the man in the hot seat by then, but the job he is doing so far should make any sell a little easier by the summer.",
      "Champions League football might be a must for Diomande in the 2026/27 season and there is no guarantee either United or Leipzig will be able to offer it to him. But if Carrick does manage to turn this good start into qualification for the competition, the Ivorian may be even more inclined to sign for the Reds should they make an approach.",

      "Michael Carrick recently said his opinion would be canvassed on potential replacements for Casemiro, and the conversation about who should succeed the 33-year-old is ongoing among supporters.",

      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are admired at Old Trafford. None of those options would be available cheaply, and there are question marks about whether they are ready to sign for United. Our writers have debated who United should sign to replace Casemiro...",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "The challenge for whoever comes in to replace Casemiro will be dealing with the pressure of doing just that. A five-time Champions League winner, 82 caps (and counting) for Brazil and nine years at Real Madrid, he was comfortable in the Old Trafford pressure cooker from day one.",
      "I like Elliot Anderson as the most stylistically similar fit to Casemiro. He is proving his worth as a holding midfielder for England, but also has a brilliant passing range. Casemiro could do both of those jobs, shielding his back four but also progressing the ball and helping to penetrate a low block.",
      "Anderson has nowhere near the experience of Casemiro, but he is the type of character who doesn't seem to get fazed. The way he has settled into the England squad and won over Thomas Tuchel is a positive sign.",
      "Adam Wharton is a fascinating player, but also a bit of a maverick in that position. I would be fascinated to see him at an elite-level club. But I think Anderson is more likely to be successful and brings a better all-round package at the moment.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest(Image: Andrew Kearns - CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Steven Railston",
      "If United are prepared to splash close to £100m on the likes of Anderson, Baleba and Wharton, they should test the waters by enquiring about Real Madrid midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.",
      "The worst Madrid can do is say no. I would prefer Anderson to Baleba and Wharton, but I've got my doubts about whether the Nottingham Forest talent is cut out for such a big move at this stage of his career.",
      "The expectation to perform to a high level each week at United is completely different to playing for Nottingham Forest. Anderson has excelled for England, but in games against the likes of Wales and Latvia.",
      "Camavinga may be an ambitious target, though. There were murmurs of interest in Morten Hjulmand last summer, and perhaps he could be an option. The 26-year-old is a Denmark international and scored an equaliser against England at Euro 2024, finishing brilliantly from 30 yards to secure a point for his country in the group stage.",
      "Atletico Madrid have been linked with a move for the Sporting Lisbon captain at the end of the season. United did alright the last time they raided Sporting for a midfielder.",
      "Sporting captain Morten Hjulmand.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Jeremy Cross",
      "United need to look to the future when strengthening their midfield this summer. Casemiro has been an expensive sticking plaster.",
      "United have to invest in someone who has his best years ahead of him, and will still have sell-on value when the time comes for him to move elsewhere. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton both fit the bill.",
      "And United should pick Anderson ahead of Wharton. The Nottingham Forest midfielder is more versatile than Wharton, and has now established himself at the highest level with England.",
      "He will go to the World Cup this summer, where it is hoped he will improve his game even more. He doesn't look like someone who would be fazed by the pressure and expectation that comes with playing for United.",

      "Benjamin Sesko delivered for Michael Carrick last week and now he needs to start a game",
      "The injury Patrick Dorgu picked up against Arsenal made Michael Carrick's decision a simple one last week, but had the in-form winger remained fit, it would have been interesting to see how the Manchester United head coach would have dealt with a predicament that is threatening to become a regular occurrence.",
      "After two goals in two games against Manchester City and Arsenal, Dorgu looked to have nailed down the spot on the left wing in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 system. The headache was Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench in both matches to register an assist and a goal.",
      "Carrick was interesting when speaking about the Brazilian at the Emirates Stadium after he scored the late winner, explaining how disappointed he had been not to start either game, but that he had channelled that frustration in the right way to make an impact off the bench.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It was excellent man-management from the 44-year-old, but Carrick has been around the block often enough to know that it also has a shelf life. After that kind of impact as a substitute, Cunha needs the reward of a start.",
      "The problem with that is the lack of games available to United this season. In the flow of a relatively standard United season, there would have been a European game for Cunha to start between those fixtures. There would be another FA Cup tie on the horizon.",
      "Instead, there are only league fixtures, and only a couple of those are midweek rounds between now and the end of the season. After his heroics as a substitute, Cunha hadn't started for three weeks. Carrick had got a tune out of the £62.5million summer signing, but had he been benched once again for the Fulham fixture, that might have changed.",
      "It is all well and good to challenge players to make an impact off the bench, but there has to be a reward when they rise to that challenge; otherwise, it becomes hollow. There will be a feeling that no matter what you do with your limited time on the pitch, it won't be enough to earn you a start.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "That's why Cunha had to start against Fulham, no matter what. The injury to Dorgu, while extremely unfortunate for a player in the best form of his United career, simply opened an easy route back into the team.",
      "Keeping a squad happy will be a challenge for Carrick over the next 14 games. It might even be the biggest challenge he faces when there are just four games in February and four games in March. Rotation isn't looking likely at the moment, with a settled team delivering results.",
      "The next situation for the former United midfielder to assess is that of Benjamin Sesko, who shone in two games under Darren Fletcher but has been a substitute in all three under Carrick. The £73million striker has been on the pitch for just 25 minutes across those matches.",
      "But he delivered what Carrick believes to be a \"huge moment\" on Sunday, scoring that 94th-minute winner against Fulham. It has undoubtedly given the 22-year-old a major lift and he has four goals in his last four appearances for United.",
      "Can Carrick keep that confidence and momentum going with cameos off the bench here and there? Or does he need to reward another young player who has done what was asked of him and influenced a game from the bench?",
      "You feel it should be the latter and that's why Sesko is surely deserving of a start against Tottenham on Saturday or West Ham on Tuesday.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“Sometimes football is pretty simple, and I think Man United’s success was always going to be basically a simple formula of working hard through youth, getting an identity and loyalty to players and the club and the fan base, and it seems to be coming back.”",

      "“He’s obviously building a strong case to maybe have that interim spell turned into a permanent manager’s job come the summer with Manchester United. I don’t think United are rushing into anything just yet,” O’Rourke said.",

Sometimes when you are like that, it can become an outburst. It is something we have of course dealt with, and dealt with internally.",

      "Criticisms of modern Arsenal all fail to understand the underlying reasons the club has become the way it is. Let’s address the criticisms one at a time.",
      "“They’re boring!”: They’re constantly up against parked buses blockading the opponent’s goal so they can’t really play fluid attacking football. It’s the defensive blockades that other teams employ that results in Arsenal games being a grind in the league, in the Champions League things are quite different since the opposition are not as conservative. Besides, for ages Arsenal were derided for failing to break low blocks. Now we’ve found solutions to them through set pieces but people whinge about it being dull as if we should be playing like Brazil ’70 against rigid defensive blockades.",
      "“They’ve spent £1b pounds!”: Remember all the years of austerity after we moved to the new stadium? We couldn’t spend like Russian mobsters and repressive totalitarian petrostates as we had to tighten the belt. Everyone mocked us for being cheapskates then. The massive spending is the result of over a decade of austerity to pay off the stadium debt. Meanwhile City and Chelsea have been able to spending lavishly the entire time, resulting in the inflated transfer fees and wages which Arsenal now also have to pay. But go on, mock us for adapting to the market created by the vile oligarchs and dictatorships.",
      "“They use dirty tactics!”: We’re no worse than any other team in terms of the usual diving, pushing and shoving and gamesmanship. Remember all those years that Arsenal were laughed at for being “soft” and not being able to handle rough rugby teams like Stoke? And now that we’ve stepped up our resilience and developed some steel you guys try to criticise us for that. Damned if we do, damned if we don’t. Just admit that you’re rattled because we’re no longer soft.",
      "“Arteta is annoying and unlikeable!”: He’s no more annoying than any other high profile manager. We’ve had the likes of Klopp and Pep going ballistic on the touchline over decisions but because they don’t manage Arsenal they’re passed off as passionate. Meanwhile Arteta tries to inject more competitive energy into a team that was frequently found lacking in the past and he’s immediately perceived as some sort of deranged lunatic. He knows that Arsenal needs to be more steadfast and streetsmart in order to win titles, we failed to win major titles because we didn’t have these qualities. He’s got to have some edge and intensity to make sure the team is competitive, just like Pep, Klopp, Mourinho and Fergie.",

      "Greetings. Andy in the mailbox asked:",
      "“What is Stewie Griffin going to have to write in about when Arsenal, the Viking clogger, El Pulizon, and all the MAGA-lite actually close it out?”",
      "It’s a simple one, this Andy. First off, I will congratulate their delirium. Much like the High school loudmouth boasting about losing his virginity at 47, despite being richer than any eligible bachelor out there…it’s quite the flex. As is Stewie’s sardonic nature, I would also have to ask Arsenal’s unhinged MAGA-Lite koolaid warriors, to revisit a few key topical matters.",
      "When Mourinho’s Chelsea was successful, Arsenal fans derided that success, calling it “Financial doping” (he spent money on players, something Arsenal are apparently loath to do). They also in unison – and we all remember, receipts are there – called Mourinho a “chequebook manager”. Given Arteta has spent over £1bn to “build” his title-winning automatons, do the same rules apply? Or will it be MAGA Revisionism IT NEVER HAPPENED, HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP etc etc…",
      "Arsenal fans insisted that it was impossible to “financially compete” with richer clubs. You apparently couldn’t ever win a title when faced with much richer behemoths. I spent years asking how eg Klopp did it at Liverpool, and Dortmund before that, etc. So will they acknowledge it was intellectual dishonesty all along, flat out lies and dissembling to excuse failure? Ooooor will it be RADICAL FAKE NEWS MEDIA WITH AN AGENDA, TERRIBLE FOR THIS COUNTRY! Etc etc…",
      "Final one this: given the borderline erotic eulogies Gooners dish out towards El Pulizon, I have to state the obvious here: for years, we were told that successful winning managers like Jose’s Chelsea, then Hiddink’s Chelsea etc were “soulless” and that Arsenal fans “would hate to win that way”. Hence, a mantra from the years of Wenger failure aka “the Arsenal way” was born. I think it had something to do with playing pretty football that helps you batter a set of clueless kids, but shit your undies and get beat 10-2, 8-2 etc. the minute you face a serious team.\nIt also gave way to a number of (virtual) trophies: the Calendar Year trophy, the “Unbeaten v Big Six” trophy, the “FFP” trophy, the “most points in the PL over three years” trophy and of course the biggest clout of all, the Top 4 Trophy – the one where you perpetually show off about qualifying for a competition you have zero chance of winning. Like a lifetime Celibate showing off about spending a night in a Travelodge with Rihanna – yeah mate, enjoy Trivial Pursuit.",
      "But we’ve now suddenly, seen a very curious shift. Arsenal are diabolical to watch. Enduring a full 90 minutes of that dross is enough to make you want to migrate (if those racist plebs from Farage’s Reform lot are determined to enforce anti-immigration, making any foreigner sit through 90 minutes of Viking Clogger and Friends simulate entertainment is enough to make anyone self-deport).",
      "Now though? Arsenal fans are all about WINNING! Apparently, playing aesthetic football is diametrically opposed to winning! You see, if one spends over £1bn then you automatically have to deploy Taliban Tactics. Not like Pep, Mancini, Ancelotti, Fergie, Klopp et al ever won PL titles playing enterprising football eh!",
      "Now, “winning is all that counts”. The problem for them, is that both things can’t be true. You can’t spend years preaching frenetically about “oil money”, “financial doping”, “boring football” etc etc – and then suddenly – pretend you never cared for those things, when it suits!!! Why haven’t we heard about the PGMOL DEEP STATE in a while? I mean, the refs literally had to apologise for farcical decisions that have gone in Arsenal’s favour eg away to Everton. Not a word. Crickets. Same way elections are TOTALLY RIGGED when Trump loses, but the system works juuuust fine (when he wins).",
      "If requiring £1bn, seven years and £15m a year to match what Claudio Ranieri managed in one year with a nothing spend, or what the now-derided Arne Slot managed in Year One (again, spent did all doing it)…then yes, I stand corrected!\nStewie Griffin (There’s still time for them to bottle this)",

      "The reality is that a 3 game win streak will accelerate you up the table and the reverse is true.",
      "The latest being Howe out. Newcastle have always been a likeable team (even when not a fan.) When they are hot, they are on fire. But when not on fire, they can be woeful. The problem is that it is hard (impossible?) to play a brand of high tempo football throughout the Premier league. More true today than even when Klopp tried it in his first full season and ran into a wall after the Dec/Jan fixture pile up.",
      "Today, teams not in Europe still have sufficient funds, because of the Premier league payouts, to acquire decent enough players with more time to prepare and recover that only large squads with quality players can break through the winter period – or focus on fewer competitions. Either injury or overplaying key players, decimates teams. Only Arsenal and City right now have those squads. Chelsea’s is massive, but either still have a few holes or are raw. Villa, still a little short. Liverpool, still need to replace a few aging players and lack depth across all areas right now. United have a decent squad now and are benefitting from the extra time to prepare (along with round pegging.)",
      "Point is, Newcastle’s squad still relies on relatively few players and, being in Europe, can’t sustain the high tempo game for a whole season. A game which on its day is brilliant to watch and devastating. But even then, once they tire in the 60th minute plus, become too open.",
      "Point is, Howe does need to change his game plan and style. I am sure a lot of Newcastle fans would do their nut, if they played that slow, methodical, ball retention build up against low blocks that Arsenal/City/Liverpool have adopted – relying on the brilliance of one or two (expensive to buy) players to come to the rescue. In an effort to ease the workload across a long, tiring season.",
      "It’s hard unless you are City, to get ‘bargain’ high quality players because of the lure of Guardiola and the promise of always being in the CL and in with a chance of trophies. Even well run clubs with big revenues (Liverpool) have to pay over the top, sell players and lose out to bigger fish. So Newcastle are in tough.",
      "Newcastle found a few bargains in players like Guimaraes in the early days of the new regime, but that hasn’t been sustained. The disruption to their Sporting Directorship/change in top management, has been the greatest impediment to Howe.",
      "Howe is generally likeable and until Rosenior joined Chelsea, the standard bearer for an English manager, managing one of the bigger English clubs. Not sure whether English managers feel that as pressure, because the red tops certainly don’t let them forget.",
      "Regardless, the way this season is turning out, there aren’t enough top quality managers in the world available right now, if all the clubs are looking for replacements. Unless you are Chelsea, who constantly replace managers, it’s a risky game.\nPaul McDevitt",

Bear in mind this was a team who had won the League title two years in the row, were in the semi-final of the European Cup and with a youthful and talented squad, were considered to be on the verge of greatness. Trying to even casually superimpose these losses over your current squad should give you pause, if not chills.",
      "Now enough has been written about the tragedy itself and for one or two generations on, it has probably faded from significance like the World Wars. What I’d like to do instead is highlight some lesser known facts around the tragedy.",
      "Real Madrid, fast becoming a major rival on the European front, offered to loan Alfredo Di Stefano, arguably their best ever player, to MUFC for the remainder of the season (but the offer was rejected by the FA). They even suggested that MUFC be awarded the European Cup trophy that year. They subsequently arranged friendlies to raise funds for the victims. Liverpool offered players on loan. UEFA wanted Manchester City to replace MUFC in Europe, but the idea was rejected, most notably by City themselves. Other teams also transferred or loaned players. Alas it took a decade for the Cup to reach anywhere near their former glory.",

The club’s Environment, Energy & Carbon Reduction Programme is longstanding, and United’s environmental management system has been certified to the ISO 14001 standard, reflecting a structured approach to continual improvement across operations.",
      "United also maintain a zero waste to landfill policy and reported that a significant portion of their waste – hundreds of tonnes – is recycled or diverted to energy recovery annually, alongside food waste being processed into biogas and reused where possible. United engage with local conservation groups for biodiversity efforts at their Carrington training centre and operate renewable energy measures, including heat pumps and biofuel use for match-day generators and grounds-keeping equipment.",
      "Sport Positive Leagues records show that between April 2022 and March 2023 over half of United’s energy came from renewable sources, and the club’s Carbon Trust Standard has been maintained through at least 14 years of year-on-year carbon reduction goals.",
      "Yet in 2026, that résumé – while positive – looks decidedly modest compared with many of United’s rivals, both within England and across Europe.",
      "The crucial difference lies not in isolated initiatives but in structural targets, transparency and overarching strategy. Although United have laid early groundwork on developing a net-zero strategy, Sport Positive Leagues notes that definitive net-zero targets, milestones and a formal governance framework are still under development, rather than already established and publicly reported. In other words, United are planning their ambition rather than executing it on a measurable, timebound basis.",
      "That contrast is most apparent when you look at clubs such as Liverpool. Since launching The Red Way strategy in 2021, Liverpool have embedded environmental and social impact deeply within its operations. The Red Way sets clear goals – including a 50 per cent reduction in absolute emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2040 – with detailed inventories covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 travel emissions.",
      "In 2023-24, Liverpool reported cutting total emissions and using 96 per cent renewable or low-carbon energy across club sites, investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate emissions from some domestic flights and utilising low-carbon biofuel for team buses. Liverpool’s progress has also been recognised with independent awards, including the Transformation category at the 2025 Sport Positive Summit, underscoring the breadth and depth of their sustainability commitment.",
      "Did you know, 100,000 tonnes of sportswear ends up in landfill every year in the UK alone?",
      "Manchester City offer another stark comparison. City’s 2024-25 sustainability reporting outlines tangible results: 25 per cent reduction in CO₂ emissions across the year, Scope 1 and 2 operations carbon-neutral, over one megawatt of solar generation on-site, significant water use reduction and expanded sustainable transport options for fans. Crucially, City have publicly committed to achieving net carbon-zero by 2030, a clear, relatively near-term target that drives investment and reporting.",
      "Even outside the top two Manchester clubs, peers are stepping up. Tottenham Hotspur became the first Premier League club to join the UN-backed Sports for Nature Framework, bolstering biodiversity protection and pledging to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2040. Independent sustainability rankings for 2025-26 place Brighton & Hove Albion as the greenest Premier League club overall, based on factors such as renewable energy use, waste diversion, water reuse and local engagement.",
      "Part of United’s catch-up problem reflects the club’s relative lack of transparent, clearly reported metrics and verified targets. Independent benchmarking, such as Premier League sustainability assessments, consistently rank United in the middle or lower tiers among the 20 clubs, largely due to limited disclosures and absence of formal net-zero timelines. While United’s ISO certification and long-running reduction programme demonstrate commitment, they lack the strategic framing around science-aligned, independently verified goals that others now publish.",
      "Operational emissions data – whether analysed through third-party assessments or club reporting – also highlights the scale of the task. Analysis suggests that the so-called “Big Six” clubs collectively account for a majority of the Premier League’s carbon emissions, with United often registering among the largest contributors due to the sheer scale of their facilities and activities, including matchday operations, training and support travel. Such findings reinforce how central the Red Devils are to the league’s environmental footprint and why their leadership on reduction strategies matters – not just for their own sustainability but for the league’s collective progress.",
      "So what would it take for United to modernise from an environmental perspective? The most immediate step would be formalising and publishing a robust net-zero strategy, complete with science-based targets, interim milestones and regular third-party verification. This should cover not only operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) but also Scope 3 emissions, including travel and supply-chain impacts, which represent the largest portion of most football clubs’ footprints.",
      "Regular sustainability reporting – in line with frameworks such as the UN Sports for Climate Action or Science Based Targets initiative – would vastly increase transparency and accountability. Intensifying investment in on-site renewable energy generation, sustainable transport infrastructure for fans and staff, and fan engagement programmes on travel choices would further align United with best practice.",
      "Embedding sustainability at executive board level – giving dedicated leadership authority and resources – would signal a shift from compliance-oriented action to strategic ambition. Ultimately, for a club with one of the world’s largest fanbases and richest brands, sustainability isn’t just a niche CSR endeavour: it’s part of safeguarding the institution’s future in a world where environmental performance increasingly informs reputations, commercial partnerships and fan loyalty.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story has thus far been one of legacy process rather than bold transformation – an ethos that has also seen them tread water on the pitch for more than a decade. The next era demands vision, measured progress and a willingness to compete off the pitch with the same intensity displayed on it. In that race, the Red Devils can no longer afford to lag behind the league’s green giants.",

      "– Tottenham are winless in their last six Premier League games (D4 L2), their longest run since their last seven in 2024-25. However, five of Spurs’ seven league wins this season have come away from home.",
      "– Manchester United are unbeaten in all nine of their Premier League games this season when they have less possession than their opponents (W7 D2), winning all seven when having less than 45%. They’ve won just four of their 15 league games when having over 50% of the ball (D6 L5).",
      "– Only bottom two sides Burnley (23) and Wolves (21) have conceded more first-half goals than Tottenham (18) in the Premier League this season.",
      "It’s easy to jump on the Carrick bandwagon and pencil this in as another win for the new boss – especially as Spurs have far more bad days than good.",
      "But the 4/7 doesn’t get the pulse racing, especially with United almost blowing a 2-0 lead against Fulham at Old Trafford last weekend.",
      "Tottenham, for all their faults, are actually unbeaten in four games (two wins in the Champions League and two draws in the Premier League) while they’ve scored twice in each of their last three away matches.",
      "Then there’s that eye-popping head-to-head record which shows Spurs are unbeaten in their last eight games against United.",
      "There’s enough there to think that Tottenham can grab a point and the draw at 7/2 makes plenty of appeal – as does the 14/1 for a 2-2 correct scoreline, the result when these two met in London earlier this season.",
      "Dominic Solanke has five goals in his last five games against United (two of those in his Bournemouth days) and is worth a punt at 11/4 to net again following his brace against Man City last weekend."

      "Tim Sherwood has urged Manchester United not to “miss the boat” for a third time and fight Liverpool for Micky van de Ven.",
      "Van de Ven has been a key player for Spurs since joining in 2023 for £35m, with his performances catching the eye of Liverpool, who are thought to be considering a move for the Dutchman as a long-term replacement for compatriot Virgil van Dijk.",
      "The Reds have completed the £60m signing of young French defender Jeremy Jacquet, who will join up with the squad at the end of the season, but with Ibrahima Konate set to leave in the summer when his contract expires, Arne Slot’s side are likely to still be in the market for further defensive additions.",
      "Van de Ven is under contract at Spurs until 2029, which has emboldened the north London club to slap a £100m price tag on his head to ward off suitors.",
      "But Sherwood believes the Red Devils should still battle Liverpool for his signature after regretting “missing the boat” with Declan Rice and Harry Kane, who moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munch respectively despite keen interest from United.",
      "“If he proves his fitness, I think there will be a queue around the block for himm,” Sherwood told CasinoStugan.",
      "“Hopefully Tottenham can keep hold of him but you know what it’s like when a player decides he wants to leave. Unfortunately, if you don’t let him go, you’re left without the money and the player in the end.",
      "“People may be shocked by that but it all depends on who they have as manager in the summer because they’ve got it wrong so many times before and it looks like they have got it right at the moment.”",
      "Sherwood continued: “United are a club that can go from where they have been to the top quicker than most because they’ve got the brand power, the money to do it. They can pay the big wages for the big players.",
      "“They missed the boat before. They could have signed Declan Rice and Harry Kane. Instead, they ended up with seven or eight signings who were alright but mostly very poor.",
      "“They won’t want to miss the boat this time on Van de Ven. He will certainly be at the top of a lot of lists at any number of clubs and Tottenham will have to fight tooth and nail to keep hold of him.",
      "“I think the only real way they keep hold of him is if Micky decides that there might be a bright future ahead at Tottenham, and right now they’re down in 14th in the Premier League and out of the running for the two domestic cups. They’re flying high in the Champions League but there are stiffer tests to come in that competition.”",

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘open the door’ for Leny Yoro to leave the club as Real Madrid reignite their interest in the centre-back, who already has a ‘verbal agreement’ in place to leave Old Trafford for the Spanish giants.",
      "Yoro joined the Red Devils from Lille for £52m in the summer of 2024 as Los Blancos backed away from their own negotiations with the young defender as they couldn’t match the fee offered by the Premier League side.",
      "Reports suggested Yoro preferred a move to the Bernabeu at the time, and he may now get his wish as a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims his name ‘once again sneaks into Real Madrid’s sports planning’.",
      "Madrid now believe that Yoro is ‘a more mature player prepared to assume immediate responsibilities’ after his time at Old Trafford, despite what many will have seen as an up and down spell at best in England.",
      "Yoro has now made 56 appearances for United, but was in and out of the team under Ruben Amorim and now firmly out of it after Michael Carrick took the interim reins.",
      "The 22-year-old has played just one minute of the Red Devils’ three games under Carrick and doesn’t look set to force his way back in anytime soon given they’ve won all three of those games, against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Carrick’s move to four at the back with just two centre-backs rather than the three deployed by Amorim will make game time far harder to come by for Yoro, who has watched Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire excel in those roles in the last three games.",
      "The report claims that while United have not ‘officially declared Yoro as transferable’, they will ‘open the door to an exit’ if Madrid are willing to make a bid of around €70m [£61m], in what would be a remarkable profit-making coup for the Premier League giants.",
      "Madrid may not need to pay that much as a report just after Yoro signed for United claimed they came to a ‘verbal agreement’ with the Red Devils that the defender could leave the club within two years for the Spanish club.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Real Madrid has reached, not officially, but through some intermediaries, that Leny Yoro has a verbal agreement with Manchester United, something that is not signed, but consensual in word of mouth, for which the French player will be able to sign for the merengue team within two seasons.",
      "‘This possibility could be realized if the white club is interested in him again and the soccer player is not happy in Manchester, as long as a price similar to the one the English have paid now, about 50-55 million euros is paid.’",
      "It’s thought such a sale would be welcomed by Untied as it ‘would make it possible to balance accounts and reorder a squad that is still in the process of being rebuilt’, with the report adding that Yoro himself ‘would not look against a change of scenery if the sports proposal is convincing’.",
      "Maguire’s future remains up in the air as his contract is up at the end of the season, meaning Yoro may just need to be patient to force his way into the United team, but Matthijs de Ligt will provide further competition when he returns to fitness, as will fellow young defender Ayden Heaven, who’s impressed when called upon this season.",
      "Carrick added former centre-backs Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate to his coaching staff when he took on his interim role, and Maguire believes they will both be offer invaluable guidance to the young defenders in the United squad.",
      "“He was a fantastic player. Coaching [here], he’s come in and been refreshing. He brings great energy to the group, to the sessions”, Maguire admitted about Woodgate.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a centre-back himself, and he’s giving me tips, and he’s definitely going to work a lot with the younger centre-backs, with Leny [Yoro], Ayden [Heaven], and Tyler [Fredricson].",
      "“But, of course, even senior players like myself and Licha [Lisandro Martinez], we can learn from him. He’s brought great ideas, and I’ve been really impressed.”",

      "On Evans, Maguire added: “Jonny is great to have around. The way that he handles himself and the responsibility that he took on his shoulders when he was a player, he can take that on to coaching as well.",
      "“Just little things like in the session the other day, I was finished and was walking in and could see that Jonny was doing extra work with Leny and Ayden. Things like that, as a young boy coming through and playing on the biggest stage, sometimes you have to learn and adapt on the pitch and on the stage, but you also can’t forget that you need to improve and you need to work.",

      "We’re really looking forward to this one.",
      "",
      "Who said Liverpool wouldn’t be involved in the title race? They can be front and centre here in confirming there will not in fact be a title race at all.",
      "We make it now five times Arsenal have been confirmed as champions and six times the title race has been declared back on, but it really would be hard to see how we get anything other than Arsenal ending all those years of hurt if this weekend goes wrong for City.",
      "With Arsenal slumming it in a Saturday 3pm slot for the second weekend in a row, by the time City arrive at Anfield for Super Sunday’s headliner they could be staring at a nine-point deficit and firmly in must-win territory.",
      "That’s not ideal when you’re going to Anfield and in your last away game you failed to win from 2-0 up against a team who at the time had fewer home points than anyone bar Wolves and had almost entirely run out of available adult footballers.",
      "City got themselves back on track a bit with a Carabao paddling of Newcastle in the second leg of their semi-final, but you’d imagine they are at least a little bit trying to work out what happened in that second half at Spurs.",
      "The concession of two goals was bad, of course, but in many ways more troubling was the fact that as things got so very far away from a team that had been in such effortless first-half control, Erling Haaland and co. managed not one second-half attempt on target against a defence of Archie Gray, Joao Palhinha, Radu Dragusin and Destiny Udogie. Or put another way, a Tottenham defence that has struggled all season was able to repel City’s advances with its third-choice right-back and fourth and fifth-choice centre-backs.",
      "It’s not a great look for City. Or for Newcastle’s defence in the first half of that Carabao clash, now we think of it.",
      "Liverpool may not have title deeds to think of for themselves this weekend, but they do still have plenty to think about having found themselves embroiled in what will likely but not definitely distil into a three-into-two Champions League squabble with Chelsea and Man United for fourth and fifth.",
      "And Liverpool are already the ones on the outside looking in knowing those two can both increase that gap on Saturday. And both are up against relegation stragglers, with Chelsea travelling to Wolves and United hosting Spurs.",
      "",
      "Which brings us neatly to our team to watch. Although frankly it’s both of them, because Man United v Spurs is a lovely little Saturday lunchtime treat for us all.",
      "Spurs against A Manchester Club is about as close to a guarantee of nonsense as the Premier League can provide. The game against City last weekend delivered in grand style, and there’s no reason to think this one won’t do likewise.",
      "United themselves remain pleasingly absurd even when in good form, so long may that continue. They have developed a particular habit this year for late twists. Emphasis on plural. There are few more extreme emotions in football than joy and relief following hot on the heels of despair, and United have perfected the art this season.",
      "Their last two games have been 3-2 wins in which they’ve conceded a late equaliser then scored an even later winner, something they also did this season at Anfield, while in the reverse fixture at Spurs they were ahead at 83 minutes, behind at 91 and level at 96.",
      "Michael Carrick has them on a three-game winning run that has prompted inevitable chatter about his interim role becoming a permanent one, because there’s no way promoting an under-qualified club legend in such fashion could ever backfire.",
      "But this is in many ways his biggest test, because he’s up against a team so stupid. More stupid even than his own. He’s beaten the two best teams in the country and in Fulham an extremely competent one. He has therefore yet to face a challenge like Spurs, a team who City can once again attest are impossible to get your head around, and who United haven’t beaten in the last nine attempts. Including, of course, United suffering just about the most embarrassing fate it’s possible for a professional football team to suffer by contriving to lose to Spurs in an actual final.",
      "Luckily for United and everyone, Spurs have already ensured they will not be using that trophy win as any kind of launchpad. That’s not the way they do things, and we’re already just a Champions League last-16 exit away from confirming year one of the next decade-plus trophy drought, one in which simply remaining in the Premier League might become a stretch target.",
      "But for now what Spurs do still have is some kind of bizarre hold over the Manchester clubs, and one that United could really do with putting right this weekend. For football reasons, with Champions League qualification very much in sight, but perhaps just as importantly for their own sanity.",
      "",
      "Brentford have been the Premier League’s surprise package this year, with a widely predicted relegation fight having never remotely materialised in a season that has instead turned into an unlikely tilt at Europe under rookie boss Keith Andrews.",
      "A large part of that has been the spectacular way Igor Thiago has emerged from the shadows of the now departed Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa to score seven more Premier League goals this season than that pair combined.",
      "With Haaland having endured one of his oddly familiar mid-season slumps in front of goal, Thiago still retains genuine hope of being crowned the least likely Golden Boot winner for many a year, trailing by just four and seemingly facing Newcastle at a very good time here.",
      "Two of his 16 Premier League goals this season came in the 3-1 win over Wissa’s new team back in November, and Newcastle hit this return fixture at a low ebb.",
      "Since a three-game winning run in the Premier League at the turn of the year appeared to have turned them back into European contenders, it’s all gone wrong again. Newcastle’s only wins in eight games since have been against PSV in the Champions League and Bournemouth on penalties after a wild 3-3 draw in the FA Cup.",
      "Even in that winning run they also conceded three goals to Leeds. Aston Villa and City have both beaten them 2-0 at St James’ Park in recent weeks, and in the last week alone Newcastle have conceded seven goals in two games at Liverpool and City.",
      "Eddie Howe is coming under pressure and could really do without the sight of the Premier League’s second-best striker right about now.",
      "",
      "We already know this will be Glasner’s last time managing Palace in the not-local-but-very-real Brighton derby; what’s less clear is how many more games he’ll be in charge of Palace altogether.",
      "It does all feel rather futile trying to sustain this visibly, grumpily broken marriage through to the summer, especially while every game for which the relationship continues Palace tumble closer and closer to mortal peril.",
      "They probably won’t go down, but it would be nice to be able to say it with any kind of confidence about a team that has simply stopped winning football matches altogether as the infighting takes over.",
      "Even Palace’s fellow relegation-tumblers Spurs are managing to kick the sh*t out of some ragtag collections of poor old German farmers every now and then. Palace didn’t even beat KuPS, who look more like the first four characters of a helpfully memorable 20-character wifi password than a football team.",
      "That final Conference League game was back before Christmas, and was the second of what is now a 12-match run in all competitions in which all manner of almost pathetically easy chances to win have been knocked back.",
      "Sixth-tier side in the FA Cup? No thank you. Dr Tottenham? Honestly, we’re fine. Nottingham Forest down to 10 for the whole second half? We won’t even bother having a shot.",
      "After Brighton, Palace’s next four games are against Burnley and Wolves in the Premier League and the two legs of their Conference punishment-round tie against Zrinjski Mostar. So Glasner and the lads don’t necessarily have to get that long-awaited win in this weekend’s formbook-out-the-window caper. But if they still don’t have one a couple of weeks from now, then things are very bad indeed.",

      "It’s Manchester United v Tottenham this weekend and that makes us very excited.",
      "The reason isn’t complicated; it’s because it’s almost guaranteed to be absurd but even more importantly with absolutely no guarantee about which specific way(s) it will be absurd.",
      "That’s the real fun. It will be ridiculous, sure, but not one of us can possibly know exactly how it will be ridiculous.",
      "Only a certified idiot would attempt to predict what would happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "Here then are our predictions for what will happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Emphasis very much on the multiple here. That’s the key to this bit. Obviously every team has games that feature late drama. It is an integral part of the game for everyone, for both good and bad.",
      "Nobody goes through a season without at least a bit of late drama.",
      "What we have here, though, are two teams whose penchant for the ridiculous often extends to the best kind of late drama, where one late sucker punch is followed by another even later sucker punch, increasingly the comedy levels of the whole thing.",
      "The reverse fixture between these two earlier in the season was a classic of the genre. United were leading until Spurs equalised in the 84th minute and then went ahead through Richarlison in stoppage time.",
      "Cue a typical quiet and restrained Richarlison celebration and further proof that the Brazilian taking his shirt off is one of the most reliable harbingers of doom this universe has yet devised.",
      "After Spurs went ahead in the first added minute, United equalised in the last, leaving neither side remotely sure whether or not they should be happy about what they’d won or annoyed at what they’d spaffed away. Which for us is the perfect outcome to any football match.",
      "FUN FACT: This match took place just 90 days ago and a now relegation-fearing Spurs were 30 seconds away from going SECOND IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE.",
      "But while it’s a wonderfully pure example, as you’d expect from a game featuring both these idiots, it is far from a rogue outlier in either side’s season.",
      "Just last week, United lost and regained the lead against Fulham in stoppage-time. At Arsenal they responded to an 84th-minute equaliser with an absurd winner three minutes later. In their other big cathartic win over a historical rival in Liverpool the timings were slightly earlier but still valid, with Liverpool’s 78th-minute leveller countered by Harry Maguire’s giant cheat-code of a head six minutes later.",
      "In a wild 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in December, United trailed after 76 minutes and led after 79 before being pegged back again.",
      "In addition to the United game, Spurs have this season managed to fall behind twice and hit back twice all within the final 20 minutes of a 2-2 draw at Newcastle, and experienced the absurd delights of watching Joao Palhinha score his second overhead kick of the season (more on that later) to drag them level at Bournemouth only for Antoine Semenyo to score a winner with his last kick before joining Man City, for whom he would inevitably also score against Spurs a few short weeks later.",
      "Spurs have drawn 2-2 against PSG in a game they led 2-0 with five minutes remaining, and have drawn three games in which they have trailed 2-0 (Brighton, Bodo/Glimt, Man City).",
      "Three of Tottenham’s last four Premier League games have featured result-altering stoppage-time goals, and the one that didn’t contained one of the least likely comebacks from 2-0 down you could possibly imagine.",
      "And let’s not forget either that these two teams also had a 4-3 caper in last season’s Carabao in which a 3-0 Spurs lead was cut to 3-2 before Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner with two minutes to go, which still left time enough for Jonny Evans to score United’s third and keep Spurs honest in the closing seconds.",
      "",
      "United have scored some very good goals this season, with Matheus Cunha at Arsenal a fine recent example. But this category has surely been more of a Spurs speciality and does feel particularly on-brand.",
      "What we like best about the sheer number of genuinely ridiculous goals Spurs have scored this season is that they’ve had these frequent oases of genius and/or ridiculousness dotted around in a barren wasteland of what is unanimously agreed to be some of the worst and most joyless, uninspired and uninspiring attacking play this or any other club has ever produced. It is genuinely unwatchable at times yet very occasionally utterly unmissable at others.",
      "Spurs have so far this season scored: four overhead kicks (one of them by a centre-back – an equaliser deep into stoppage-time, naturally – and two from a workhorse, tackle-loving defensive midfielder), a box-to-box individual effort sure to get a Puskas nomination (also scored by a centre-back, but a different one), a completely pointless goal from 45 yards out in the middle of what otherwise appeared to be some kind of anti-football dirty protest of a performance in a humbling at Arsenal, and a scorpion kick to provide what was, in multiple ways, the single most unlikely equalising goal on record.",
      "So we will accept nothing less here than Destiny Udogie running the length of Old Trafford before scoring an overhead rabona from 37 yards. In the 98th minute. Before Bruno Fernandes scores a penalty in the 101st.",
      "",
      "Not, admittedly, a novel idea. But surely never a stronger claim than now.",
      "We make no apologies for the fact Romero is one of our absolute favourites. There’s always something about any player who combines genuine elite talent with what at times borders on a kind of actual madness.",
      "It also means he is often unfairly punished because there are few players more conspicuously preceded by their reputation, but never mind that now because on this occasion it helps us because we are actively predicting it.",
      "Romero is an emotional sort, prone to head-loss and at all times capable of losing the entire run of himself. It can happen at any time.",
      "But consider the current state of things and it’s easy to see why this is a perfect storm of a game.",
      "First of all, Romero can go rogue at any moment but does tend to preserve his red-card shenanigans for the biggest games. His three Premier League red cards have come against Manchester City, Chelsea and this season against Liverpool. His other two Tottenham red cards have been against Milan in the Champions League and, well, Vitesse Arnhem in the Conference League so forget about that last one.",
      "Four out of five in all and three out of three in the Barclays is still a trend, okay. Shut up.",
      "There is also his current frame of mind to consider. We’ve all seen the switch flick in games with Romero and realised what might come next. “Oh, he’s ticking,” Gary Neville will caution on co-commentary with all the faux-concern of David Brent fearing a September wedding could be a washout.",
      "Romero is going to start this game already ticking loudly after lashing out and going in two-footed, studs-ablaze on the Spurs suits after a deadline day squib.",
      "He’s also been ill, which restricted him to 45 lethargic and painful minutes against City last weekend, and none of us is at our best mentally or emotionally when we’re poorly, are we?",
      "It all has us wondering what’s the earliest in a game anyone has suffered the ‘save him from himself’ pre-red-card substitution? Because it could happen in the warm-up here.",
      "",
      "Okay, so a bit cake-and-eat-it this one, but what we’re saying here is that it’s not going to be like 1-1 or 2-1. It’s either going to have all of the goals or none.",
      "United’s last two Premier League games have been 3-2 wins and Spurs’ last two Premier League games have been 2-2 draws so we’re very hopeful it’s the former. Spurs have conceded at least twice in their last five games against Premier League opposition (one of those was Villa in the FA Cup)",
      "For Man United, it’s four of the last five (again including a 2-1 home FA Cup defeat, in this case against Brighton).",
      "Both clubs’ runs include conceding twice against Burnley, who have only managed to score twice in eight Premier League games this season. For added fun, one of the other six was also against Man United in one of what are now the Red Devils’ trademark 3-2 wins.",
      "We also of course have the 2-2 draw between these two sides from earlier in the season, as well as that 4-3 Carabao caper last season.",
      "But we must also prepare ourselves for the fact that these two sides are also capable of taking a game that appears to offer a near guarantee of goals – and also brilliant ones – yet instead provide none of that.",
      "The Europa League final remains one of the funniest things ever to happen because imagine losing to Tottenham in an actual final, but it was also one of the most wretched football matches ever staged in which Spurs scored the scrappiest imaginable version of their favourite goal under Ange – cross from the left, converted from close range by Brennan Johnson – and then defended for their lives against a United side with absolutely no idea how or what to do to prevent the banter apocalypse about to befall them.",
      "And you might say well that was such a high-stakes game for both sides it was bound to happen. But Spurs also beat United 1-0 in a crap league game last year where an early James Maddison goal was enough.",
      "Spurs famously beat United four times last season, and United failed to score in three of those games. Remember, this was a Spurs team being managed by Ange Postecoglou, a man who considered the entire concept of ‘defending’ to be an act of craven cowardice that bordered on cheating.",
      "Goals appear so inevitable here that, sure, it might be 4-4 after one team is 4-0 up after 17 minutes. But it’s also just possible these two teams are capable of stupidity that cancels the other’s out so entirely that it instead ends up the worst 0-0 draw you’ve ever seen.",
      "",
      "The boldest shout, because Spurs these days specialise in beating teams from daft little farmers’ leagues from unlikely-sounding countries such as ‘Germany’, while losing to pretty any proper (i.e. English) team.",
      "But there are a few reasons to suspect it could happen here. Firstly, a Spurs win is funnier than a Man United win and that is a powerful force in the universe.",
      "Spurs have also just emerged from a five-game Premier League run against Brentford, Sunderland, Bournemouth, West Ham and Burnley in which they took only three points and no wins. It’s vital and inevitable they outperform that pathetic return against mainly bad sides in the run of five games against mainly good sides currently underway against City, United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "A win at Old Trafford to clinch it just two games in would be powerfully Spurs and enormously United.",
      "There is also the perplexing fact that these days United don’t ever actually beat Spurs. We all know the four defeats from four games antics of last season, but they form just part of what is now a nine-game winless run for United against Spurs in all competitions.",
      "Imagine that. Imagine going nine straight games against the stupidest team in the world without a single win; it would be enough to make you think that maybe you are in fact the stupidest team in the world. Now there’s a thought.",
      "The last time Man United beat Spurs, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and Harry Kane was on the scoresheet. It was a long time ago, is what we’re saying here, and seems even longer than it actually is, which is a less impressive-sounding ‘just under four years ago’.",
      "We also think Spurs will win because we think United will lose. Obvious, but there you go. Simple reason being that recent history tells us that United will always lose in ludicrous fashion at the precise moment they think they’re on to something.",
      "No club turns more corners only to end up right back where they began than United, and three straight wins is just about perfect. We all obviously thought the Fulham game was ideal ‘come unstuck’ territory after beating City and Arsenal but think about it. That was too obvious. That was such an obviously different game from those first two of the Carrick Era that it would’ve been too predictable for it to go wrong there.",
      "No, far better to scrape through that by the skin of their arse and then actually come unstuck a week later against Banter FC.",
      "We do, admittedly, have some time for the counter-argument that what United will actually do is keep winning games until they eventually give in and, against their better judgement, give Carrick the job permanently only for results to then fall off a cliff.",
      "Which leads us to the safest conclusion of all. The funniest outcome here is for Spurs to win, or at least not lose, or for Man United to win.",
      "We can’t wait.",
      "Manchester United’s sustainability story smacks of box-ticking more than a drive towards meaningful change. They should be leading the way like Liverpool.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "Spurs defender Cristian Romero has been urged to “shut up and play football,” with one pundit claiming Thomas Frank should strip him of the captaincy.",

      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",

      "Angel Gomes was being heralded as the possible solution for Manchester United and England a little over a year ago, but now the diminutive midfield conductor finds himself at rock-bottom Wolves after a summer move to Marseille failed to pay dividends. But might a brief spell in the Premier League open up a back door to his boyhood team?",
      "“Coming here, I’ll try and show what I can do, what I’m about, try and be a positive addition to the team, and try to be as positive as possible to help in all aspects,” Gomes has said having made the loan switch to Wolves, aware that the rest of the season will act as a four-month shop window for alternative suitors.",
      "Given his “excitement” at returning to the Premier League, he’s not about to agree to a permanent move to a Championship-bound side, should Wolves take up the option from Marseille, if there are top flight sides keen on signing him in the summer.",
      "After Jose Mourinho nearly made him cry at Manchester United amid a crisis of confidence which threatened to derail his career entirely, Gomes opted to leave for France despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attempts to keep him at Old Trafford. Some hugely impressive displays at the heart of Lille’s midfield led to a shock England call from Lee Carsley for the Nations League games at the end of 2024.",
      "At that stage, when Manchester United were knee-deep in a midfield crisis which has now abated but not yet been solved, Gomes was heavily linked with a return to his former club, for whom he made his senior debut alongside a certain Michael Carrick.",
      "“I came on and Michael Carrick did everything possible to allow me to touch the ball,” Gomes told The Guardian about his United debut in 2018. “Every time he had it, I could see that he was looking for me.”",
      "Carrick named Gomes, along with Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard, as “real, real talent” which made him feel as though he could retire with the club in safe hands. There’s clearly a mutual respect.",
      "Whether there’s enough respect to push Carrick into vouching for Gomes in a discussion with the INEOS bosses over midfield additions in the summer remains to be seen, which when added to the uncertainty of Carrick’s long-term future at the club and if the United chiefs will take any notice of his thoughts on transfers if he is handed the reins on a permanent basis combines to make Gomes to Manchester United feel a whole lot of unlikely.",
      "But amid talk of the Red Devils analysts processing the stats of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba with a view to picking their ideal new midfielder, very little has been made of the very high likelihood that they’ll need two of them, if – as we’re led to believe – Manuel Ugarte is set to follow Casemiro out of the club having failed to meet the mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Unless they have £200m to spend on two of those three top candidates, and they don’t, United are going to need to source a low-cost option to bolster the squad on top of that marquee addition.",
      "Truth is it’s going to be hard for Gomes to prove he’s that option in one of the worst teams in Premier League history, just as it will be hard for commentators to cover Wolves games featuring Angel Gomes alongside namesakes Joao, Rodrigo and Toti, but at least he’s been handed the chance to knock on that back door to Manchester United, which Carrick may be more amenable than others to open if he’s still in the job."

      "We’ve ranked the top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025/26 season. The biggest takeaway? Sunderland have absolutely smashed it.",
      "Arsenal spent big on Zubimendi and it’s instantly paid off, with those around him taking their game to another level, namely Declan Rice.",
      "Sunderland, meanwhile, were ambitious enough to convince Xhaka to return to the Premier League. They immediately gave him the captaincy, and his leadership and quality have elevated the Black Cats.",
      "Anyway, signings of the season ahoy. Here’s our Premier League top 10. Click here for those signings who might just be a bit sh*t.",
      "",
      "From Bertrand Traore for only £2.1m to Habib Diarra for £27m via Granit Xhaka for £13m, Sunderland’s summer business has aged tremendously. We honestly can’t believe how successful their signings have been.",
      "With the exception of Simon Adingra, Sunderland didn’t waste a single penny. Reinildo on a free transfer has been a revelation and Sadiki has made £15m look like an absolute bargain as well.",
      "The former Union St-Gilloise midfielder gave up Champions League football to join the ambitious Black Cats and will not regret that decision. Of all the players Regis Le Bris brought to the club last summer, he feels the most likely to land a huge transfer to a Big Six club.",
      "",
      "Summer signings Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are proving to be very good, very important Manchester United players.",
      "The Red Devils missed Mbeumo during his Africa Cup of Nations exploits and his return has added new life to an attack enjoying their football under Michael Carrick.",
      "Naturally a right-winger, Mbeumo has been played through the middle for United and looks a handful for defenders. His link-up play is good and while he doesn’t win many aerial duels, he is competing for the ball and allowing his team-mates to gobble up second balls. He has been crucial.",
      "",
      "Sunderland dominate this ranking, with Alderete coming in as the second of five Black Cats summer signings.",
      "This guy is a dog. His player-of-the-match performance against Manchester City epitomised everything he’s about. He has that South American bravery that sees him put his body on the line time and time again. He’s just fantastic.",
      "We’re not sure how Sunderland have nailed their summer business to this extent, but they’ve made some absolutely outstanding signings for very modest fees.",
      "",
      "Manchester City signed arguably the best goalkeeper in the world for just £26m. That’s probably all that needs to be said.",
      "Yes, Donnarumma isn’t entirely convincing with the ball at his feet, but he’s hardly clumsy and is arguably underrated in that regard. Pep Guardiola wouldn’t sign him if he didn’t fit the plan, even as Pep adapts to a more direct style in his latest football revolution.",
      "The Italian’s presence has brought calm to City’s backline and he is a monster of a signing in every sense.",
      "",
      "Another monster Man City signing.",
      "Cherki has shown he can win City points on his own and, aside from the goals and assists, he’s simply an incredibly exciting player to watch.",
      "The Frenchman’s flicks and tricks are a joy to behold – a breath of fresh air in an otherwise robotic sport.",
      "",
      "Leeds made some solid additions last summer but none have been better than brilliant German midfielder Stach.",
      "He has added a threat to set-pieces with his ability to take them and his incredible height. Stach brings control to the Leeds midfield and dominates most of his individual battles. Simply put: he’s brilliant.",
      "Stach’s team-mate Dominic Calvert-Lewin deserves an honourable mention.",
      "",
      "If we’re being brutally honest, the signing of Mukiele looked nailed on to be a waste of time and money. It’s been anything but.",
      "Arriving from Paris Saint-Germain after a loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen, he seemed destined to flop.",
      "Instead, the Frenchman has adapted seamlessly to Premier League football, excelling in both a back four and a back five under Regis Le Bris.",
      "",
      "Premier League pacesetters Arsenal look excellent and Zubimendi is a big reason why.",
      "The Spaniard has slotted perfectly into the No.6 role, freeing Declan Rice to push forward and setting off a domino effect that’s lifted Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard too.",
      "He keeps things ticking over beautifully, with the defensive steel Mikel Arteta craves. It will take something special to reach Rodri levels of control, but Zubimendi might be the final piece of Arsenal’s title-winning puzzle.",
      "",
      "Sunderland’s summer business has been a roaring success, and Roefs has been at the heart of it.",
      "The young Dutch goalkeeper has brought calm, composure and confidence between the sticks. We can’t quite believe how good some of Sunderland’s signings have been, and having five of them in this ranking says it all.",
      "",
      "Premier League signing of the season: Granit Xhaka.",
      "We couldn’t believe Xhaka wanted to swap Bayer Leverkusen for Sunderland, especially given the record of newly promoted sides. But his arrival has gone a long way to ensuring the Black Cats buck that trend.",
      "Le Bris’ side remain unbeaten at home since returning to the top flight, with the only game they’ve failed to score in coming in the 0-0 draw against Man City on New Year’s Day.",
      "The Switzerland and Sunderland captain has clearly raised the levels at the Stadium of Light and looks one of the best No.6s in the league, underlining just how vital that position has become.",
      "It’s no coincidence that Zubimendi, Sadiki, Stach and Xhaka are all in this top 10, and that Rodri won the Ballon d’Or last year. The defensive midfield role has become the position every manager wants to build around.",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of three defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "Man City v Liverpool headlines a very tasty Big Weekend indeed that also offers the slapstick charm of Spurs v Man United and some relegation six-pointery.",
      "Xhaka has recalled how Arteta used chairs to illustrate the “chaos” at Arsenal on his first day as Gunners manager ahead of their reunion on Saturday.",
      "It’s hard to think of a better summer signing by a newly promoted Premier League team than Granit Xhaka to Sunderland. He was outstanding against Everton.",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams."

      "Rashford is expected to complete a permanent move to Barcelona, and his departure would help open the door for United to add a new attacking option as part of the next phase of their rebuild.",
      "While midfield remains the top priority for Man Utd heading into the summer window, the club have already signalled their intent to strengthen out wide.",
      "Their earlier attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo, who eventually ended up at rivals Man City, was viewed internally as an indication that a winger would be added, even if it was not the immediate focus. Now, with Rashford’s permanent exit increasingly likely, sources believe United will revisit the winger market.",
      "One name emerging strongly is Yan Diomande. Indeed, there is a growing feeling within recruitment circles that Diomande could be the first option United explore as a replacement.",
      "Other clubs who have enquired about the RB Leipzig winger have come away with the understanding that United are very much in the picture and could lead the race for his signature when the summer window opens.",
      "Diomande, who could cost as much as €100m (£86m / $118m), has scored eight goals and added six assists in 21 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig so far this season and remains one of the most talked about attacking talents in Europe.",
      "We have also reported how United will look towards Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye as a target from within the Premier League. The Senegal international, who is capable of playing on both wings but largely operates on the right, has a combined goals/assists tally of six this season in 20 appearances for the Toffees.",
      "His current market value is £39m (€45m  / $53m), as per Transfermarkt, although Everton will almost certainly demand more to sell to a Premier League rival, especially with the 25-year-old under contract until 2029.",

      "Meanwhile, my TEAMtalk colleague Graeme Bailey can also reveal, via sources, how Rashford “has not spoken to anyone at Manchester United about the possibility of returning to Old Trafford, despite ongoing negotiations between the two clubs over his long‑term future”, as there appears to be no way back for the player.",
      "Bailey revealed: “Senior United sources insist that nobody at the club – including interim boss Michael Carrick – has contacted Rashford regarding a comeback. The message from the player’s camp is equally clear: Rashford has no intention of returning to Manchester and remains fully committed to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford and his representatives are aligned with Barca’s vision for him, and the Catalan giants have assured the England international that he will continue at the Camp Nou beyond this season. Barcelona hold a £26million option to buy, and we are told Rashford is so determined to stay that he has even indicated he would be willing to give up part of his salary to help reduce the overall cost of the move.",
      "“With two-and-a-half years remaining on his lucrative United contract, such a gesture underlines how strongly he feels about continuing his career in Catalunya.",
      "“As our sources previously revealed, United are keen to avoid a scenario in which Barcelona attempt to negotiate another loan deal next season. Discussions are ongoing over how a permanent transfer could be structured, but Rashford’s stance leaves little room for doubt: his future lies in Spain, not in Manchester.",
      "“Despite being pleased to see United’s recent resurgence under Carrick, sources close to the forward insist that Barcelona is the only club he wants to play for going forward. Indeed, Rashford is described as ‘very happy’ with his life in Catalunya, both on and off the pitch, and there is no desire whatsoever to return to Old Trafford.",

      "The Red Devils decided to bring in a coach with an understanding of the club to smooth the transition into a short-term role, allowing director of football Jason Wilcox time to undergo a thorough recruitment process.",
      "Put to Carrick that he will surely be happy to be part of that conversation if his success continues, the head coach said: \"I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm here, you know.",
      "\"I feel at home here but I fully understand the situation, so I'm not getting too carried away.\"",
      "Carrick's only focus right now is United's upcoming matches, with Saturday's match against Tottenham followed by facing another of his former clubs on Tuesday - West Ham, away.",
      "\"What he needs - and it probably wouldn't help him - is to win five or six on the trot, then lose three or four on the trot, and then how do you respond?",
      "\"People will say he should never be Man Utd coach. But when you lose those three or four games and the scrutiny comes on you at the biggest club in the world, how are you going to cope?",
      "\"We saw it with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, he came in, was at the wheel - but then you see pictures of him at Watford away when they got destroyed and he looked lost.",
      "\"Carrick probably needs to lose three or four on the trot, then win five on the trot and everybody will go: that's a good manager. He's turned it around when the pressure was on. That's the only way you're ever going to know how good he is.\"",

      "Friday 6 February 2026 20:47, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight ahead of a busy Premier League weekend.",
      "A record number of goals are being scored from dead-ball situations this season, corners are such dangerous avenues for goals and centre-backs with aerial dominance have never been more valuable from a betting perspective. Yet one of the best set-piece attackers in world football has barely been on the pitch for most of it.",
      "Harry Maguire is back in the Manchester United fold, though, and looking in fine fettle in both boxes. Since returning, he has registered four shots in just 281 minutes, generating an expected goals figure of 0.62, which is of course a chunky output for a centre-half. That includes hitting the crossbar against Manchester City.",
      "There is value to be had on Maguire and it is in his shots prices - most notably his headed shots price of 10/11 with Sky Bet. Across the last six Premier League seasons, only Virgil van Dijk is recording a headed shot at a higher rate than Maguire - one every 177 minutes.",
      "Whenever this bet is 10/11 or bigger it's an automatic back for me if Manchester United are the favourites to win the game.",
      "Like most Arsenal home games against anyone outside the elite, this is a challenging betting heat where the Gunners are 1/5 with Sky Bet to land the odds. Other traditional markets like the over/under 2.5 line are priced up correctly too so we have to get creative here for an angle.",
      "Trai Hume's fouls committed prices are worth a look at Evens for 2+ with Sky Bet.",
      "Hume has made 16 fouls in his last eight starts, averaging out perfectly at that two fouls line with a switch of position helping to keep those fouls numbers bulky. He's playing more as an inverted wide midfielder rather than a full-back and being in the heat of the battle against the Gunners will see him threaten that fouls line.",
      "Bournemouth to make the most fouls in each half at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a wager that's cashed in each of the last five head-to-head meetings.",
      "That's no fluke.",
      "This fixture is consistently foul heavy because of the tactical clash between the managers as Villa under Unai Emery are happy to play fast and vertically, forcing Bournemouth into reactive defending, broken play and ultimately, fouls, to stop transitions. The numbers back it up too as the head-to-head record shows Bournemouth average 17 fouls per game, compared to just 10 for Aston Villa.",
      "At odds-against, backing Bournemouth to win the foul count in both halves looks a smart way to play a match-up that keeps telling us the same story.",
      "Crysencio Summerville is thriving under Nuno Espirito Santo, not only in terms of his overall attacking output but also in the way he is terrifying defenders.",
      "The only way to stop him is to foul him which is leading to cards. Under Nuno, Summerville has drawn 12 cards off the opposition - that's the most of any player in the Premier League this season. Kyle Walker will be the man responsible for stopping him - a player who has been carded eight times already this season. The 100/30 with Sky Bet for a Walker card is very generous.",
      "James Garner to have 2+ shots at 11/8 with Sky Bet makes appeal.",
      "Garner's development this season has been a real success story for David Moyes, who has pushed him higher from midfield which has allowed him to get himself into shooting positions rather than just recycling possession. The raw numbers tell the story as no Everton player has attempted more shots this season than Garner (39), which underlines just how licence-heavy his role has become. This match-up suits that trend too. He fired off four shots in the reverse fixture against Fulham.",
      "Yerson Mosquera to score for Wolves at 16/1 with Sky Bet is firmly on the radar against a Chelsea side that continue to look alarmingly vulnerable from dead-ball situations.",
      "Only Crystal Palace have conceded more expected goals from set-pieces than Chelsea this season (12.67 xG), while 10 actual goals shipped from those scenarios underlines that this is a structural problem, not bad luck.",
      "And one that hasn't been solved since the change of manager.",
      "That will be music to the ears of a Wolves side who are unapologetically set-piece orientated under Rob Edwards, with delivery and movement clearly drilled on the training ground. Mosquera is becoming increasingly prominent in those situations too. He's gone close in recent weeks, racking up 11 shots across his last six games and was desperately unlucky to hit the post against Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Rico Henry to be carded at 9/2 with Sky Bet looks a lovely angle to attack because of what's brewing down that flank in terms of fouls in this game. Henry is likely to spend large periods dealing with Anthony Elanga and that's a match-up that tends to end with the defender running the risk of a card.",
      "Since the start of last season, Elanga has drawn 20 yellow cards from opponents, using his pace and direct running to force last-ditch challenges when he shifts the ball past his man. The timing looks right too. Elanga showed signs of hitting form again in his last outing against Manchester City, scoring a beauty of a goal and carrying a real threat in transition when repeatedly engaging his full-back one on one.",
      "Crystal Palace have not won in their last 12 games in all competitions but everyone knows about their current plight. But it's pretty gloomy at Brighton too, who have finally started to prove me right in how much of an overrated team they are. Just one win in 11 games means Fabian Hurzeler is facing huge pressure now.",
      "And, this is exactly the type of opposition they struggle against: low block, long quick vertical football and a head-to-head record of winning just two of the last 13 games with their rivals. Looking at the match odds, where Brighton are around Evens, market forces are also now becoming cold on this Brighton team which is quite a big pointer that Hurzeler is going to struggle to turn this around.",
      "Trusting Palace though isn't viable either, meaning the draw makes lots of sense to back at 13/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Liverpool at 11/8 with Sky Bet? Sign me up.",
      "Since drawing at Leeds, their defensive numbers are back to where they were last season, offering up very little to the opposition in terms of big chances. Across their last 13 games, they've conceded just 0.75 goals per game to a backdrop of 0.8 expected goals against per game. Arne Slot has fixed the leak.",
      "Yet, Man City's defensive structure and out-of-possession play has quietly become a cause for concern. They are showing signs of the same problems of last season where teams were finding it so easy to play through the City midfield and defence to create big chances.",
      "Since they drew with Chelsea, in six games where they've gone off bigger than 1/3 to win, they've been repeatedly badly exposed defensively, shipping an expected goals against tally of 1.6 per 90 and facing 4.8 shots on target per 90.",
      "Liverpool may run riot if City don't tighten up, meaning the home team handicap market at -1 at 7/2 with Sky Bet is a lovely way to back Slot's men to win by two or more goals."

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "Sunday 1 February 2026 17:54, UK",
      "Marco Silva claims VAR overturned Manchester United's penalty in their 3-2 victory over Fulham for a different foul because the original decision by referee John Brooks was \"so bad\".",
      "Brooks awarded United a first-half penalty at Old Trafford after Matheus Cunha went down in the area under a sliding tackle from Jorge Cuenca, but replays showed the Fulham centre-back had won the ball.",
      "VAR James Bell overturned the decision and awarded a free-kick instead for a shirt pull on Cunha by Cuenca, with Casemiro heading in the opener from Bruno Fernandes' cross at the resulting set-piece.",
