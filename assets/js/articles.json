      "Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign three free agents during their striker search - with Jamie Vardy among the names put to them.",
      "The Red Devils are in the market for more firepower and have a No.9 on their radar in the coming weeks. Currently their transfer pursuits have centred around deeper forwards with Matheus Cunha in the building and Bryan Mbeumo on their radar.",
      "Ruben Amorim also wants a central striker to arrive this summer and several of their targets could head elsewhere. Viktor Gyokeres looks bound for Arsenal if he does come to the Premier League and Liam Delap has already chosen Chelsea over Manchester whilst Victor Osimhen has a number of options.",
      "It leavers the club on the lookout and, should they continue to miss out on personnel, they may scour the free agent market. Vardy recently left Leicester after more than a decade of success and is among those who have been put to the Manchester outfit, reports the Athletic.",
      "Several other proven Premier League goalscorers are also available for nothing. Age is not on their side but they could still do a job with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Callum Wilson suggested to the Red Devils.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has opted for pastures new with his Everton contract expiring this summer. Newcastle meanwhile opted against extended Wilson's deal and he is set to look for a new club. Both have previously been capped by England.",
      "It is though that Amorim and co would only advance on these, if at all, towards the end of the window if they do not get any of their top targets. The issue for United in recent summers has been their poor identification of talent with their current crop of forwards not cutting it.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was signed from Atalanta two years ago with a long-term view being taken, but the Dane has not developed as they hoped and now looks bereft of confidence. A move back to Italy is mooted. 12 months on and Joshua Zirkzee was captured, but he too has struggled for goals.",
      "It leaves United desperately looking for a spark in attack - less term they scored 44 times in the Premier League, nearly half of Liverpool's total. Their lack of European football could prove an issue with their recruitment and in the past, albeit with a previous hierarchy, they have panicked and bought in players late in the market.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United are set for a major squad overhaul this summer as they look to bounce back from a disappointing campaign that saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the Premier League and lose to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United have already forked out £62.5million to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves, while 18-year-old defender Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno. Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof have both left after their deals expired, while Jonny Evans has retired.",

And new AC Milan boss Max Allegri has now insisted Leao will remain at the San Siro despite interest from Barcelona.",
      "\"I'm sure I can bring out that extra something he's been missing,\" Allegri said. \"I'm glad he's stayed, he's now more responsible, more mature, and has all the qualities to become one of the best.\"",
      "Manchester United are open to selling goalkeeper Andre Onana for £30m, just two years after forking out around £50m to sign him from Inter Milan.",
      "Ligue 1 side Monaco and clubs from the Saudi Pro League have been credited with an interest in Onana, with United chiefs said to be keen to get his salary off the wage bill, and the 29-year-old has publicly hinted at an exit.",
      "When asked about his future while attending an event in Burkina Faso last month, Onana told Afrik-Foot : \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "Napoli have been heavily linked with a move for Alejandro Garnacho, but it appears as though the Serie A champions have decided against signing the forward.",
      "Garnacho is one of five players that appear to have no future at Old Trafford, but Napoli have targeted PSV Eindhoven star Noa Lang instead. According to reports from Italy, Napoli have struck a deal with PSV worth around £24m and the move is set to be completed.",

      "Marcus Rashford reported back for pre-season training at Manchester United on Monday and Tuesday - despite being given extra time off to find a new club. Rashford, 27, was among five players who United told could return to Carrington at a later date if they were unable to secure a transfer.",
      "But the England international still arrived at the Red Devils' training centre. Rashford worked individually and wasn't part of any sessions with rest of Ruben Amorim's squad, the Athletic report.",
      "That group of players included new £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha, who the club announced in a social media post on Tuesday had taken the No.10 shirt from Rashford. United said on Friday that Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia would be allowed to return later in July amid their uncertain futures.",
      "Carrington's medical and rehabilitation services have remained available to the players during their extended summer breaks. It was reported last week that all five stars had asked to leave United, although some of the players' representatives have denied this.",
      "Garnacho has been linked with moves to Chelsea and Napoli, Antony is wanted by Real Betis and it's been claimed in Italy that Sancho has agreed terms with Juventus. Malacia, meanwhile, is said to be struggling to attract buyers.",
      "Barcelona are the favourites to sign Rashford after missing out on top target Nico Williams, who's signed a new 10-year contract with Athletic Bilbao. Luis Diaz is an option, although Liverpool recently rebuffed an approach from Bayern Munich.",
      "It's been reported in Spain that Rashford would be willing to take a sizeable pay cut on his £325,000-a-week salary in order to join Barca, who'd prefer a loan deal given that United are demanding £40m. The Red Devils want to raise funds before making any further signings beyond Cunha and Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, as talks between the clubs over a potential £63m deal continue.",
      "Amorim wants to refresh his attack which is why Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are on the chopping block. Should they manage to offload their unwanted stars, United plan to dip into the striker market, having missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea earlier in the window and Viktor Gyokeres - who worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon - set to sign for Arsenal."

Both would also likely cost a significant sum and at the ages of 29 and 28 respectively, neither Watkins or Wissa would have much sell-on value.",

Bayern legend Thomas Muller has also left the Allianz Arena upon the expiry of his contract.",

      "Veiga, who played for Portugal when they won the Nations League last month, wasn't included in Enzo Maresca's squad for the ongoing tournament. The 21-year-old joined Chelsea from Swiss heavyweights Basel last summer for £12m, having come through the ranks at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Bayern are familiar with Veiga thanks to his loan spell with Bavarian neighbours Augsburg in the 2022-23 season. They're also well acquainted with Nkunku, who took the Bundesliga by storm at RB Leipzig after leaving Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The Frenchman scored 70 goals and provided 56 assists in 172 appearances for the east German side, playing in a variety of positions. That convinced Chelsea to stump up £52m, although injuries have stunted his progress at Stamford Bridge and he's been unable to carve out a starting place amid their gluttony of attacking talent."

In a candid interview, the Manchester United defender revealed how therapy transformed his life, offering a rare glimpse into the personal challenges faced by a Premier League footballer.",
      "Martinez, who has endured a series of injury setbacks since joining United in 2022, admitted that his mental health took a hit during his time in the Netherlands. \"I've been in therapy since I was at Ajax,\" he told Clank Media.",
      "\"I was always against it until I found myself at a point in my life in Amsterdam where I had everything... I played for a European team, I was in the national team, I had the car I always wanted, I played every weekend, and I still felt empty, like I wasn't happy.",
      "\"It's not an easy process. You have to have the humility to accept being a normal person. Yes, I'm a footballer, but it's a profession, it's a sport, and we're all people.\"",
      "Therapy, he explained, helped him shift his perspective. \"Since I started, I haven't stopped,\" Martinez continued. \"I understood that you shouldn't look for anything outside but rather inside. I found happiness and peace with myself, which is priceless.\"",
      "His reflections on his upbringing in Gualeguay, Argentina, paint a picture of resilience forged in adversity. \"I come from a very poor background,\" he shared. \"I know what it is to struggle, to be hungry, cold, hot. Did I go hungry? Yes.",
      "\"From a very young age, we were a very large family. Three families lived together, my grandparents, my uncles and cousins, all on the same plot of land.\" Meals were sparse, often just tea and bread for dinner, but Martinez looks back with gratitude.",
      "\"Maybe without that, today I wouldn't be who I am,\" he said. \"What percentage of chances are there for a kid from Gualeguay, from the neighbourhood I came from, to get to where I am today?\"",
      "Injuries may have slowed him down, but Martinez has been on an upward curve ever since turning pro in 2016. After sealing a career-launching move to Ajax in 2019, the centre back - who has regularly been written off due to his small stature - starred as the club won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in 2021 and 2022.",
      "Shortly after following Erik ten Hag to Old Trafford, he fulfilled a lifelong dream by lifting the World Cup with Argentina. Success at United has been limited to a couple of domestic cup wins, but when fit, Martinez has proven himself to be up to the challenge.",
      "Ten Hag's departure in 2024 cast doubt over the 27-year-old's future in Manchester, particularly with his unconvincing injury record. But Martinez, who was sidelined again with an ACL injury in February, says he has a good relationship with new head coach Amorim, who has brought \"energy and willingness\" to the squad.",
      "\"The club is obviously going through a process of change,\" he said. \"Since Six Alex Ferguson's departure, they haven't found a manager who hits the right note. Ten Hag did a remarkable job at Ajax, which is why he went to United, and thanks to him, I joined the club as well.",
      "\"It's like everything in life: you take a gamble, and sometimes it works out well, sometimes it doesn't. I think that, like any club, if something isn't working, it needs to be changed. It's necessary to analyse what's working and what isn't and make changes accordingly because that's how great clubs operate. Manchester is one of the best clubs in the world.",
      "\"Now Ruben Amorim has arrived with very good energy and willingness. I believe he will make the necessary changes. Without a doubt change is needed, because where we ended up in the table over the last two seasons is unacceptable.\"",

      "Amad was seen entering the training facility wearing the eye-catching football-style T-shirt with neon pink, green, blue, red and yellow zig-zag streaks running through it.",
      "At the top of the shirt was three white stripes running across the shoulders, a V-neck white collar, an Adidas logo and a Glastonbury icon at the top left.",
      "He was also wearing black sunglasses and holding a black duffel bag and he entered the building wearing denim short and green trainers.",
      "His shirt number 16 was also printed on the back of the shirt, which has been inspired by the music festival's pyramid stage and colourful tower alongside it. It's known as the Adidas Originals x Festival shirt and was available to purchase for £80, but the jersey sold out before Glastonbury even started on June 25.",
      "Amad's choice of T-shirt went down well on social media as one wrote: \"Amad with the Glastonbury T-shirt on, my man!\"",
      "Another wrote: \"Love the Adidas top, it's mint,\" as a third said: \"Welcome back star boy,\" and added: \"Amad's a Glastonbury guy? Give him another new contract.\"",
      "Amad was one of United's first names on the teamsheet last season in as he scored 11 goals and assisted eight in all competitions in his breakthrough year under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He suffered a devastating injury that disrupted the end of his season, though he did return for the final seven games as he inspired the team on their journey to the Europa League final, which they lost 1-0 to Tottenham.",
      "Amad was one of many familiar faces spotted back at Carrington, along with the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Mason Mount, Matthjis de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "United, who have added one big signing in Matheus Cunha, are gearing up for a massive season under Amorim as they look to turn their fortunes around following a disastrous season that saw them finish 15th, with 18 defeats.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for the 28-year-old, but Newcastle have now emerged as a potential destination. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe is a long-term admirer of Calvert-Lewin, with the Magpies having previously attempted to sign him last summer.",

Erik ten Hag was enjoying his second full summer transfer window at Old Trafford at the time, desperate to further improve the Red Devils side he inherited after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he showed an interest in Guerra.",
      "The 22-year-old midfielder's £87million release clause reportedly caught the attention of the United top brass, who were contemplating activating it to bring the Spaniard to Old Trafford. However, Valencia insisted that they held no intentions of cashing in on their wonderkid, who initially rose through the youth system of Villarreal before a 2019 move, signing his first professional contract two years later.",
      "Their sporting director Miguel Angel Corona told the Mail at the time: \"We are fully aware that we have a player with enormous potential for the future and the ability to perform at a good level now. That is why the club have decisively moved him up to the first team in recent months. It is not in our plans to sell him to any club.\"",
      "He added: \"For us, the emergence of Javi Guerra has not been a surprise. We have been aware of what he is capable of for a long time, we have been helping him and demanding more from him every step of the way, from youth level to the elite.",
      "\"He has to continue working in this way. We have to be cautious when making assessments about his level or how far he will be able to go, as he is a young player and has a long way ahead of him, but only he, with his day-to-day work, will determine where his limit is.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Guerra himself admitted in May 2023 that his family had urged him to remain at Valencia. He said: \"They advise me to stay the same, not to change because all this has cost a lot of work and we have to continue like this.\"",
      "The news came as a big blow to Ten Hag, as well as Newcastle United's Eddie Howe, who was also said to have been monitoring the youngster's situation closely. United instead secured Mason Mount from Chelsea in a £55m deal, as well as Sofyan Amrabat on loan from Fiorentina.",
      "However, it now appears as though the Red Devils are once again in the running to secure Guerra's services. While United have looked to bolster their frontline thus far, with the addition of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and a pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim is also looking at strengthening the centre of the park.",
      "And as per reports in Italy, Guerra looks increasingly close to finally leaving behind the Spanish sunshine in favour of north west England. While his hefty release clause is still in place, United may look to negotiate a cheaper deal for the talent, given that they have already spent big this summer and have a number of other targets in place across the pitch.",
      "With Christian Eriksen departing and Casemiro's playing time at the Theatre of Dreams uncertain, Amorim could be looking at a younger squad base to adapt to his patented 3-4-3 system. And Guerra could certainly fit the bill as an excelling partner to Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte, as Kobbie Mainoo's own place in the starting XI is in question given he has struggled to play to Amorim's style.",
      "He impressed in La Liga last season, scoring three goals and providing three assists in 36 appearances for Valencia, who finished a respectable 12th in the standings. And with a struggling United finishing a record-low 15th in the Premier League, Amorim will be eager to find more stability and composure in the heart of midfield ahead of next season.",

      "And he has now opened up on his decision to leave having been effectively cast aside by then boss Ten Hag. Speaking to The National, the 22-year-old said: “I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "“I spoke to my dad and agent and said: ‘I can’t do this for another year’. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the under-23s. I thought to myself, ‘I’m just like a number’.”",
      "Iqbal was hopeful that he would be afforded an opportunity to play against Charlton Athletic in the League Cup, only for Ten Hag to dismiss him once again - and that’s when he realised he needed to leave.",
      "He added: “Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn’t see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I’d come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn’t feel the manager respected me enough to play me.”",
      "And having seen a number of promising youngsters look for opportunities abroad, Iqbal had no hesitation at leaving, especially after Ten Hag had asked him not to play at the under-19 World Cup.",
      "Iqbal said: “The manager [Ten Hag] listened and then told me he didn’t want me to go to the tournament. He said it was the end of the season; we had injuries and needed training numbers, too. He told me to stay patient. So I did. I was sure I’d play some minutes and become the first Iraqi player in the Premier League.",
      "“It didn’t happen, not even in the last games when there was little to play for. My best friend, Ali Al Hamadi of Ipswich, became the first Iraqi player, so I’m happy it’s him.",
      "“But I told my agent that I needed to move. I’d done everything that was asked and didn’t get a chance. I saw that Jadon Sancho had moved abroad from Man City, Paul Pogba from Man United. I was happy to try and take a similar route.”",
      "Iqbal’s talks with Ten Hag were not just limited to a transfer request. The Dutchman was also spotted letting his fury with the youngster be known as he slammed him as “f***ing rubbish” during a training session.",

Other factors like the nature of the commercial agreement were cited as factors, as reported by the Telegraph.",

Having cameras inside the dressing room for potentially defining moments is ideal for broadcast, but unlikely to be high on Amorim's wish list.",

      "Of the quintet, Garnacho is the one for whom United can charge the most. He's youngest of the five, has shown he can cut it at United and doesn't command a £350k-a-week salary like Rashford.",
      "Indeed, his deal is increasingly key for the club's accounts, because his sale equates to pure profit. The current issue however is that while there's been plenty of speculation around potential suitors - Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Napoli and Juventus to name four - none have come forward with an offer.",
      "Indeed, they're looking elsewhere. Chelsea have turned to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund as well as £60m Brighton striker Joao Pedro in recent days, Juventus like Jadon Sancho and have landed Jonathan David in forward positions and now Napoli have turned to £24million PSV Eindhoven star Noa Lang, with an agreement finally reached between the two clubs.",
      "As such, the door on a move to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium for Garnacho appears to have been firmly closed.",
      "United must keep searching for a buyer to give them what they want. But selling Garnacho across Europe this summer is starting to look harder than it previously did.",
      "And if the player was thinking of being the next Scott McTominay, he may need to think again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Former Manchester United star Juan Mata believes that it'd be a 'win-win' if Marcus Rashford stays at Old Trafford. Rashford, 27, is expected to leave United this summer after being sent out on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of last season.",
      "The England international isn't part of Ruben Amorim's plans and has had his No.10 shirt taken by new £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha. Rashford didn't return for pre-season training on Monday like the bulk of United's squad, as he's been granted additional time off to explore a move away.",
      "Barcelona are the favourites to sign him but United's £40million asking price has put a fork in the road. But Mata doesn't want to see his ex-team-mate, who watched Rashford break through from the United academy, playing at the Camp Nou.",
      "\"As a Man United fan and as a friend of Marcus, I wish that he can succeed here because it's his club, his boyhood club,\" Mata told the Athletic. \"I don't know what's going to happen but if he stays and he can actually be happy and enjoy, I think it will be a win-win situation for both the club and him.\"",
      "The Spaniard, who currently plays for Australian side Western Sydney Wanderers, added: \"I saw his first training (session) with us. I love him.",
      "\"As a kid, I called him 'the wonderkid'. The way he played was fearless, you could feel he could win a game by himself at any time when he was playing at his best.\"",
      "But Rashford's recent actions suggest that his two-decade-long association with United is at an end. The forward no longer has 'Manchester United' in his social media bios and is keen to join Barca.",
      "Last month, Rashford was asked by Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer whether he'd like to play alongside Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future. \"Yeah, sure,\" the 27-year-old replied. \"Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Which club should sign Marcus Rashford? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Rashford also suggested that he'd be an able backup for Barca talisman Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 in August. \"For me as I've got older, the No.9 position is becoming more comfortable, more natural,\" the United wantaway added.",
      "\"Small things, such as playing back to goal, it's becoming easier for me. You're always in front of the goal so you're always dangerous.\""

      "The former Atletico Madrid man was a leading target for United head coach Ruben Amorim to strengthen his attacking options this summer. It is expected that he will operate as the left-sided No.10 in the Reds' front-three.",
      "United's decision to hand Cunha the iconic No.10 shirt almost certainly signals the end of the road at Old Trafford for Marcus Rashford, who has worn the No.10 shirt since the start of the 2018/19 season.",
      "The attacker, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has informed United of his desire to leave the club this summer and was not present for the start of pre-season training.",
      "The attacker is expected to move abroad and has attracted interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich. However, his £325,000-a-week wages could be a stumbling block in United's hopes of offloading him on a permanent basis.",
      "They have not dismissed the prospect of a loan exit for the England international, who is refusing to take a wage cut. It is understood Rashford wants to join a club who can offer him Champions League football.",
      "As far as Cunha is concerned, United's decision to award him the No.10 shirt means he will don the same number as he wore during his final season at Molineux. He also wore the No.10 shirt during his time at Hertha Berlin earlier in his career."

      "Manchester United's search for a striker this summer was never going to be easy or straightforward.",
      "Just two-and-a-half weeks out from their opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States, United are in a race against time to ensure a new goal-getter makes their travelling squad.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, Viktor Gyokeres was name-checked by no shortage of United supporters as the striker they should go after to strengthen the tip of their attack. Head coach Ruben Amorim worked with him at Sporting Lisbon and the Swede has scored 97 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "However, Gyokeres wants to join Arsenal and a deal is on course to get over the line. Once again, United have been forced to go back to the drawing board.",
      "United have expressed interest in Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike in recent weeks, impressed by his haul of 22 goals last season, but the German club's demands will make life difficult for the Reds. Jonathan David, another striker linked with United in recent months, has been snapped up by Juventus.",
      "It means United are running out of options in their search for an elite-level goalscorer. David and Gyokeres are members of that category and were both attainable this summer.",
      "However, a lack of European football for 2025/26 and financial constraints mean United are being forced to box clever. They have already spent £62.5million on Matheus Cunha and remain determined to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for a similar fee.",
      "As a result of United's determination to strengthen their attack with three new faces, they have already reached a point where they are snookered. They need to oversee a crop of sales before advancing any further with their recruitment drive.",
      "After finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, the need for a reliable goalscorer has never been greater. Cunha will inject goals into the forward line, likewise Mbeumo if that deal eventually gets sorted, but neither of them are a natural No.9.",
      "According to The Athletic, United have been offered the opportunity to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jamie Vardy and Callum Wilson, each of whom are currently free agents after leaving Everton, Leicester City and Newcastle United respectively.",
      "With the utmost respect to those three aforementioned strikers, who have an impressive 290 Premier League goals between them, none of them offer the answer United are looking for. Calvert-Lewin scored three league goals last season, Vardy will turn 39 in January and Wilson has not scored a Premier League goal since May last year.",
      "In the cases of Vardy and Wilson, their best years have been on gone, whereas Calvert-Lewin has only reached double figures in the Premier League twice in his career. In truth, United would be questioned for signing any of them to take second spot in the pecking order, let alone pole position.",
      "It is not unusual for agents to offer their clients to clubs at this time of year as unattached players look to secure a contract to write the next chapter in their careers. Agents will be mindful of United's desperation for a goal-getter and will be prepared to chance their luck.",
      "The chances of United turning to Calvert-Lewin, Vardy or Wilson are slim. They have, with respect, set the bar much higher, hence why they have been linked with the likes of Victor Osimhen and Gyokeres throughout the summer.",
      "United both want and need a striker who is considered as one of the best in the business, but goalscorers of that ilk cost a pretty penny. Who United will turn to, though, is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Sales remain key to their chances of strengthening their attack and they are yet to oversee a permanent departure this summer. If they are successful in their attempts to offload the likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, they will be able to use the funds generated from those sales to try and attain the striker they are looking for.",
      "However, there is currently no obvious answer to their striker search, meaning the situation is appearing unlikely to be resolved ahead of the pre-season tour.",
      "Not for the first time in recent years, United's primary transfer mission is shaping up to be the hardest to solve."

      "If anyone thought Manchester United reaching an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window was a sign of things to come, they have been forced to think again.",
      "After signing Cunha on June 1, United's interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo emerged just over 24 hours later.",
      "It was an early indicator of just how fast the Reds wanted to move at the start of the window and it immediately improved morale among the club's supporters after a forgettable 2024/25 campaign.",
      "But just over a month since they lodged their opening bid for the Brentford attacker, United are yet to reach an agreement with the Londoners for the Cameroon international, who has made it clear that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "After seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down at the start of June, United lodged an improved offer in excess of £60m a few weeks later, and it was understood the deal was close to being finalised.",
      "However, almost a fortnight has passed since then and United are yet to reach a full agreement with Brentford, despite maintaining a degree of confidence that the deal will be done.",
      "United wanted to have Mbeumo signed and in position for the start of their pre-season training preparations. Instead, Diego Leon and Cunha were the only new arrivals present at Carrington on Monday.",
      "United will head to the US for their pre-season tour later this month and head coach Ruben Amorim will be hoping to have the bulk of his transfer business done by the time he and his players fly across the Atlantic. In reality that feels unlikely.",
      "United have prioritised strengthening their attack this summer and news of their interest in Mbeumo was almost immediately applauded. He scored 20 Premier League goals last season and would be an excellent addition.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to occupy the right-sided No.10 role in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after making a habit of drifting inside off the right flank during his time at Brentford. It is believed Cunha has been drafted in to operate in the left-sided No.10 role.",
      "Although it is currently impossible to predict just how United might line up for their season opener against Arsenal next month, Amorim is not short on options in the No.10 positions. Cunha's arrival is expected to see Bruno Fernandes drop into the centre of midfield, leaving Mason Mount, Amad and potentially Mbeumo squabbling over the right-sided No.10 berth.",
      "Amad has proven he is equally effective as a right wing-back or a right-sided No.10 in Amorim's system, but Mount is restricted to one role in the head coach's preferred system. Fortunately for the former Chelsea man, he is held in very high regard by the Portuguese boss.",
      "Amorim has waxed lyrical about Mount throughout his United tenure. He shared his admiration for him before even taking charge of United for the first time last November.",
      "If Mount can put his injury struggles behind him, Amorim will have plans to make full use of him this coming season. However, if Mbeumo eventually seals a move to Old Trafford, regular starts may become difficult for the England international to attain.",
      "But with the opening game of United's pre-season campaign now a little over a week away and the club's pursuit of Mbeumo lacking any sort of pace, Mount could find himself in pole position to start against Leeds United in Sweden and attempt to nail down a starting berth ahead of the US tour.",
      "After being consistently lauded by Amorim and bagging a start in the Europa League final in May, Mount will fancy his chances of becoming a key player in his third term at Old Trafford after his first two were ravaged by injuries.",
      "The longer United's pursuit of Mbeumo takes, the stronger Mount's chances of becoming a starter in Amorim's first-choice XI will become."

      "The United chief has already been able to land one of his top targets, securing Matheus Cunha's services from Wolves for £62.5million last month, but progress on other fronts has since slowed.",
      "United looked set to build on the signing of Cunha by also getting a deal over the line nice and early for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. This publication reported a fortnight ago that a deal was close to being finalised after United had submitted a second offer in excess of £60m.",

However, some supporters are beginning to get itchy feet at the length of time it is taking and are fearing United are getting dragged into a never-ending saga.",
      "Originally, United set a target of signing Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training. Fifteen players reported back to Carrington on Monday and Diego Leon and Cunha were the only new additions to be introduced to their new teammates.",
      "Despite United's desperate need for fresh blood this summer, they are not thought to be close to completing any other signings at this stage. Player sales remain key to their hopes of strengthening Amorim's squad and the club is yet to oversee a permanent departure in this window.",

      "With a fortnight to go until United are scheduled to fly to the US, they are approaching a key period in the transfer window. Amorim, just like every other head coach and manager, will have the ambition of having the bulk of his transfer business done ahead of the start of the season, ensuring new signings get as long as possible to get to know their new teammates and what is expected of them ahead of the competitive action starting in August.",
      "United made their opening offer for Mbeumo, which was worth £55m, more than a month ago, meaning everyone anticipated a deal would be wrapped up by now. Instead, the saga is still rumbling on and a second bid north of £60m has not been enough.",
      "United are prioritising strengthening their attack this summer and put down an early marker by signing Cunha. Having then set a target of signing Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season, United made it crystal clear that they wanted to move at speed.",
      "Having missed that particular deadline, United must now attempt to get the former Troyes man through the door ahead of flying across the Atlantic in a fortnight's time. Their opening game of the Premier League Summer Series is against West Ham United on July 27.",
      "It would be ideal if United could get Mbeumo through the door by then as they are unlikely to have landed an out-and-out centre-forward, which is another leading priority this summer, by the time they face the Hammers in New Jersey.",
      "The prospect of having Cunha and Mbeumo in attack in time for the tour would supplement the absence of a new chief striker. They scored 37 goals between them last season and will be able to ease the burden on whoever ends up being Amorim's starting No.9.",
      "But with the clock ticking and the start of the tour now just over a fortnight away, United are in a race against time to bring this saga to an end and make Mbeumo their latest summer signing."

      "United suffered a bitterly disappointing defeat to Tottenham in May’s Europa League final, failing to capitalise on a last-ditch chance to secure European football for next season. A 15th-place finish in the league also marked the club’s worst showing of the Premier League era.",
      "Still, there are reasons for optimism. Wolves forward Matheus Cunha has become the first new arrival of the summer, and with Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo also a key target, the Red Devils could be set to unveil a completely revamped attacking line next term.",
      "Attention is also turning to the midfield, with GOAL Brazil reporting that Atalanta’s Ederson is once again drawing interest from United’s hierarchy, who have made enquiries about the 26-year-old’s availability this summer. However, the Manchester club are not alone in their pursuit, with both Inter Milan and Juventus also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "The report adds that Atalanta will demand a fee in the region of €60 million (£51.6m) for Ederson during this transfer window and appear more open to selling him than in previous years. Last summer, United were rumoured to be among several clubs, alongside Chelsea and Newcastle, linked with the Brazilian, but the Serie A outfit were unwilling to sanction a move at the time.",
      "Now, after three seasons in Bergamo, Ederson could finally be on the move. Since arriving in Italy in 2022, he has made just shy of 140 appearances for Atalanta in all competitions, scoring 13 goals along the way."

      "Manchester United are still attempting to lure Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "The proposed transfer - which feels like it has eclipsed most of the summer so far - looks to still be on the cards, given the Cameroon international has expressed his desire to link up with Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have already seen two bids for the 25-year-old rejected, with talks thought to continue this week over a proposed move. Mbeumo is Premier League-proven and remains Amorim's biggest target to fulfil the right-sided No.10 role in his 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived for a fee thought to be in the region of £62.5million, with Ineos set to pay his fee in three instalments over the next three years. Mbeumo's deal from the Bees seems a little more complicated, with Brentford happy to allow the former Troyes man to leave the club, but only for the correct fee.",
      "Having scored 20 goals, last season, what is interesting is exactly how much it will take to see a deal over the line, especially given the increase in his value over the past 12 months. According to Transfermarkt, Mbeumo was priced at just €40million (£34.4million) last summer, with his cost having now skyrocketed to €55million (£47.3million).",
      "It is worth noting that player values provided by the popular data-led site are determined by a community-based system, not an algorithm. Various pricing models are considered, which may not always be accurate, but do give a rough guideline based on multiple factors.",
      "For example, a highlighted fee may be specific to how much a team values the player in comparison to how much he is actually worth in the real-world market. United have been criticised for \"giving in\" to agent fees and club demands over the years, but this is something Ineos, along with sporting director Jason Wilcox, are working hard to avoid moving forward.",
      "Two bids, as mentioned, have already been swatted away by the Bees, ranging from £55million and £62.5million. Now, it remains to be seen if United continue to press on with a third bid in the next week.",
      "All things considered, it does appear likely the Cameroonian will join United this summer - but where Wilcox and even Omar Berrada decide to draw the line on his market value remains unknown."

Back in the summer of 2023, the Spain Under-21 international was valued at just €2million (£1.7million), but an impressive start to the 2023/24 campaign saw his market value skyrocket up to €20million (£17.2million) after just three months.",

Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",

Given the Gunners’ lack of haste this summer, we suggest the Blues don’t hold their breath, but we would certainly keep an eye on this one.",

      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now.",

Longstaff is a year from leaving for nothing, which is something the 27-year-old, apparently, wants to avoid for the sake of his hometown team making a few quid. Which is different…",

Barry, who bagged 11 goals last season, was flying somewhere prior to the weekend, we assume into Merseyside.",

      "He didn’t score in the Premier League until his 15th appearance, finally netting against Aston Villa on Boxing Day before going on a brief run of seven goals and two assists in seven top-flight matches.",
      "Hojlund was poor overall last season, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances as United finished a dismal 15th.",
      "That form has led co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to consider selling the 22-year-old this summer, with interest from Italy — where he scored 10 goals in 34 games for Atalanta in 2022/23.",
      "One of the clubs keen on Hojlund is Inter Milan, who are reportedly looking to bring in the Danish striker on loan. United, however, are said to prefer a permanent deal if he is to leave.",
      "According to Interlive.it, Hojlund is already on the transfer list at Old Trafford, even though he ‘wants to stay’.",

      "Inter’s preference is a loan deal, potentially with a conditional obligation to buy, and the report adds that they haven’t ‘interrupted contact’ with the intermediary working on the deal.",
      "According to what has been collected by Interlive.it, in fact, it has been a while since the Nerazzurri have interrupted contact with the intermediary who was following the operation.",
      "Inter were working on a loan deal with the right or conditional obligation to buy. In this sense, however, an opening from Manchester had not yet arrived.",
      "The INEOS company is aiming for a permanent sale, see the negotiation for Sancho with Juve, precisely because it wants to get rid of those who are not part of the plans immediately.",

      "Because Inter have abandoned (at least for now. If Thuram left…) the Hojlund track? Because, as is well known, he decided to keep Pio Esposito who at the Club World Cup – for the little he played – proved to be a footballer already up to the situation.",

      "Garnacho then burnt all remaining bridges by posting a picture of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford’s name on the back, another player looking to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Rashford at least seems to have more interest with rumours of a move to Barcelona seemingly unable to go away. The Spanish club’s failure to land Nico Williams has reopened the door to Rashford who has been linked with a move since January.",
      "Rashford reportedly sees a move to Barcelona as his ‘dream destination’ and is eager to get the deal done.",
      "If that fails to materialise, Newcastle are said to be interested in the England international but have been more closely linked with free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin after the 28-year-old left Everton.",
      "According to reports, one key issue is preventing Manchester United from completing a double deal worth around £65m in a triple blow for the Red Devils.",
      "According to reports, the ‘latest development’ at Manchester United has angered four ‘unhappy’ players as INEOS look to cash in on several unwanted talents.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided more details on Alejandro Garnacho’s future after he ‘informed’ Manchester United of his ‘wish to leave’.",
      "According to reports, five Manchester United stars have ‘informed’ the Premier League giants that they ‘wish to leave’ during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Manchester United have ‘asked intermediaries’ whether they can seal a £45m deal with Chelsea this summer as they ‘monitor the Blues’ outgoings’.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer."

      "And now reports in Spain claim that Rashford ‘sets a condition for joining Barcelona’ as president Joan Laporta and sporting director Deco ‘continue to view his potential arrival very positively’.",
      "Barcelona ‘is by far the most attractive and convincing option for him, so he has shown his willingness to make a significant financial effort, accepting a considerable reduction from his already high salary’.",

      "“He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career, of course he does – he is well within his rights to do that. We are in constant dialogue with him and representatives about that. As it stands at the minute we don’t have an agreement in place for him to leave.",

      "“He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There’s no harm in keeping your best players.”",

      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils were the fifth lowest goalscorers in the Premier League last season as Ruben Amorim’s side finished 15th in the table in a terrible campaign.",
      "Hojlund, who was signed for £72m from Atalanta in 2023, and Joshua Zirkzee came in for a lot of criticism with the Man Utd duo scoring just seven Premier League goals between them.",
      "And now Man Utd are on the lookout for a new striker this summer but it is not clear which of the duo will leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on Monday that Hojlund wants to stay at Man Utd this summer and will only leave if the Red Devils force him out.",

      "READ: Mailbox: Spare Ruben Amorim the excuses before he ‘sh*ts the bed’",
      "“So, Hojlund would really hope and love to stay at Manchester United. The only possibility for Hojlund to go is if Manchester United decide to let him go, to sell him, to make profit with him, and all these kind of things.",
      "“If Man United decide for him to go, Hojlund has to go. Otherwise, if it’s for Hojlund, I’m hearing that the player would be keen on staying at Manchester United and would love to stay at Manchester United.”",
      "And now Roma are set to enter the race for Hojlund with Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio told TipsBladet that the Serie A side ‘will probably come on board because [Gian Piero] Gasperini really likes him, but it can only succeed as a loan deal’.",
      "An immediate move to Inter Milan currently ‘seems dead’ while other Italian sides AC Milan and Atalanta could also join the race later in the summer.",
      "Aston Villa striker Watkins is a rumoured target to improve the Red Devils’ attack but former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson insists that the deal could total £100m, including wages.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I think a lot of what United are lining up is dependent on players leaving.",
      "“Actually, Hojlund in many regards is not one of the players that I’ve sort of had at the fore of my mind for what their challenges are.",
      "“It does look like there’s a little bit of interest maybe in Hojlund, but at what financial level? If it’s a loan deal, then does that really help them?",
      "“But let’s say they get rid of a whole load of players and then look at Ollie Watkins. Now, Ollie Watkins is a player that’s 29 and 30 in December.",
      "“I would be quite amazed if Manchester United after everything that they’ve talked about, every sort of bit of briefing that they’ve given, if they then said what we’re going to do now is we’re going to bring in a 29-year-old player this season and put him on a five-year contract because that’s what it’s going to be.",
      "“Ollie Watkins is not moving to United for less than £200,000 a week, so we’re going to have a £10million contract. We have to pay a £50million transfer fee and he’s 29.",
      "“I don’t know, football is crazy. It’s not impossible, and they definitely obviously have shown some interest.",
      "“But it’s pretty amazing that they’d do a £100million deal on Ollie Watkins after everything they’ve just been through with other failed signings.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker would welcome the signing of “workaholic” Watkins admits he is a “fan” of the Aston Villa striker.",

      "Why are we making excuses for Amorim?\nI saw Matt Stead opining the need for poor Amorim to get a proper pre-season and how the club have let him down.",
      "First, as he mentions, it starts today. And second, the major missing pieces were a number 10 who was willing to bridge between midfield and striker – something Bruno doesn’t suit – and a RWB that isn’t Dalot.",

Maybe he can spend this time – again to be clear, starting today – to teach players how to pass into the box. Just put a cone there if you don’t want to waste time with your actual striker making runs that no one passes to. Who knows, maybe Bruno will be able to see it. If so, maybe whoever gets the now poisoned chalice of the 9 shirt should wear it in matches.",
      "So, what’s the issue? What problem are we trying to solve with a 3rd/4th player for the right with one game a week that is so desperate?",
      "Is the issue that he needs different players or pre-season? Maybe “buy me a whole new team like the did at Sporting” is what Amorim means by pre-season?",

He has got 14, 19 and 17 in his last 3 seasons. He scores crucial goals and is technically elite. He can actually dribble too, unlike Martinelli sadly. Martinelli cannot cut inside and shoot. He’s just not capable.",
      "Rodrygo will have no issues tracking back – he’s literally known for his defensive work so it’s weird you even mentioned that point. Mbappe and Vinicius are the ones who don’t put a shift in. I still like and want Martinelli but he definitely needs to be upgraded upon.\nDion",
      "",
      "Defending Arsenal on Partey\nI want to address the rancid steaming pile of droppings that is Stewie’s latest email. There’s no point addressing the football/transfer window content – it’s just too easy to point out he’s talking ass.",
      "However, I do want to address the question of Partey, suspension, and whether Arsenal has done anything wrong by continuing to play him. In short, Arsenal have not, and once again Stupid Griffen couldn’t be more wrong.",
      "The longer version of this explanation is that a suspension is needed when protection of the integrity of the investigation is required (most likely not in this case as I have not seen anything to suggest the alleged offences were in or related to the workplace). Further, and this is the key part, an employer such as Arsenal is obliged to avoid making public statements and taking any actions that might be interpreted as implying guilt and therefore prejudicing the defendant at trial.",
      "This extends to making public statements in the media or on social media, a point which was made by the CPS last week, when announcing charges against Partey:",
      "“We remind everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. We know there will be significant public interest in this announcement, but it is absolutely vital that there is no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”",
      "If Stupid Griffen ever bothered to listen or read, rather than just spout guff, he might have seen this or examined the rules. Assuming everyone wants Partey to receive a fair trial then suspending him is not the right approach.",
      "IF Partey is guilty, and you therefore want him convicted (rightly so, IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE), then no one wants his case to be thrown out on the basis that he didn’t receive a fair trial due to public opinion having been swayed by Arsenal’s actions or media stories that might be said to have influenced the verdict.",
      "Moreover, Arsenal is a company recently valued at GBP 2.1 Billion by Forbes. Does Stupid Griffen imagine that Arteta and a couple of the coaching staff went to the pub and decided what to do with Partey when they discovered the investigation was taking place?! Of course not, you lump of lead. Arsenal has an extensive team of HR and in-house lawyers who would have tackled the issue. No doubt they also would have received extensive external legal advice from top law firms and/or criminal barristers.",
      "Given that this situation has been running for a few years, I suspect Arsenal’s legal bill over this issue would make most people’s toes curl. I imagine Arsenal would have been at pains to make sure they were complying with every bit of advice given to them every inch of the way.",
      "Finally, if the above summary of the law and some facts aren’t enough for Mr. Stupid, then I’ll add my own ‘moral’ take. Everyone has the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty and to receive fair trial. A world in which people are banned from their jobs/society because an accusation is made against them is not one I want to be a part of. It’s one step away from Nazi/Soviet totalitarianism where people ‘vanished’ because their neighbour reported on them for… something.",
      "The only Kangaroo Court I want to be a part of is an F365 vote on whether the rest of us want any more Stupid Griffen emails to ever be published again. I think you can all tell which way I’m leaning.\nJosh, AFC, Dubai",
      "",
      "…I felt compelled today after reading two negative opinions on Arsenal about the Thomas Partey situation. I feel there is a lot of ignorance being spewed as knowledge by many who",
      "1) Do not know about investigations\n2) Do not know what the club knows\n3) Despite saying otherwise have concluded someone is guilty just because he is charged",
      "I work in law enforcement investigating complex fraud and I know how long investigations take. We investigate for on average 3 to 4 years before gathering enough evidence to determine if a charge can be brought against an individual. During that process the individual has the right to keep on working and living his life.",
      "If we deem the person a flight risk, ie he may leave the Country for a jurisdiction we may not be able to get him back from, then we decide whether to take his passport away and keep him in this Country before a charge is or is not brought against him. After charge the case goes to Court and a jury decides his fate.",
      "Now in this case it was well known Partey was under investigation. This takes years and he is able to work and live his life during this period as long as he is not deemed a violent risk to others during the period of the investigation (an example of someone who may be deemed a risk is someone who works with children being investigated for molesting a child. That person will and should be immediately suspended).",
      "In Partey’s case, Arsenal would have assessed that he is not a risk of further offending after the opening of the investigation and may have been in dialogue with the Police about the investigation. Normally when we investigate we do not divulge any details of the investigation. It is likely the Police did not let on as to what will happen in their investigations to Arsenal. The club would have thus been in the dark. All they know is that Partey denies the allegations and as there were no charges against him the club had no reason to suspend him!!",
      "If the club has to suspend every player just because an investigation is started against a player they will be setting a very dangerous precedent. What about Mason Greenwood some might say. Well that was different because their was a piece of evidence out in the public domain which forced Man United’s hand. There is no such thing here.",
      "Another point is that as long as Partey was playing at Arsenal he was not deemed a flight risk. The Police may have even come to an arrangement with Arsenal for this to be the case. I am speculating here. So cant say if this is true.",
      "One thing that is certain is that things changed the moment Partey’s contract ceased at the end of June. Partey could now go abroad. He is a flight risk. The Police needed to move fast. Do they charge him with the evidence they have or take a chance he leaves the Country. It will take too long to seek a warrant to detain him and take his passport so the quickest thing to do is charge him based on what they have.",
      "As the Benjamen Mendy case showed a charge is not the same as guilt. And to charge in this manner may have been rushed. I do not know for sure. All I know is that the CPS must be sure of their evidence to take this step.",
      "We do not know what the outcome would be. The alleged victims need to be provided with support. Partey also needs to be given support as he denies the allegations. We should stop taking sides until the full story comes out in Court. We should stop hammering Arsenal for things we know nothing about and for speculating on what the club knew or did not know.\nMichael O",

      "Football has endemic problem with misogyny\nIt’s open season on Thomas Partey and Arsenal, but they are just the latest in a long, long list here.",
      "I would suggest that people at the behaviour of Solskjaer with regard to Babacar Sarr, and whilst this happened in Norway, before his tenure at United, it still calls into question the character of a man who United employed. It’s a horrible story, and if you take the time to look into it, I promise you’ll look at Ole differently afterwards. And whilst we are at it, didn’t they also re-sign a very famous footballer who paid off an accusation of rape a few years ago?",
      "He is possibly the most telling example of all, here. The highest profile footballer in the game, even now, and this “incident” was completely swept under the carpet with money.",
      "We all know the game is broken here – all round good guy Pep Guardiola stood as a character reference for Benjamin Mendy when he had multiple accusations of rape, and he did so in a completely voluntary capacity, despite admitting that he had no idea how the player behaved, but was happy to stand up in court and call him a “good boy”.",
      "I don’t mean to pick on United or City particularly. Someone in the comments showed today how poorly Liverpool handled the Jon Flanagan situation, and there are countless examples of football clubs acting in a completely amoral manner when it comes to employing people convicted of all manner of dreadful crimes.",
      "The usual suspects in the comments are coming across appallingly, because it is their tribal hatred that is driving these comments, not their concern for the endemic misogyny within the game. Football has a real problem – female fans suffering appalling harassment, women’s football being denigrated all the time, and female football commentators and pundits receiving constant criticism and abuse, most of it fueled by the “logic” that as women, they are simply not qualified to have valid opinions about such a manly sport.",

      "Jota not my favourite Red\nThese past few days, Diogo Jota’s passing has been top of mind each morning and my last thought before bed. Across football many have said something to the effect of not knowing the lad, but still feeling visceral grief as if firsthand, or that it was strange feeling such grief only mostly having seen just the footballing side of him. It’s definitely been strange to try and reconcile.",
      "Having heard others have also struggled to process his passing, I’ve come to resolve some of my parasocial dissonance, believing I’m not acting unknowingly self-performative or subconsciously mining for inorganic emotion. It’s all been genuine. And if I feel this way about it from so far removed, I simply cannot fathom what the players will feel when doors open to preseason this week, or worse yet, the vast depths of sorrow the immediate families of the brothers must feel at every turn.",
      "Last night I finally sat down and watched one of Jota’s goal-compilation videos; I remembered just about every goal he’d ever scored for Liverpool. We’d always known he was a clinical poacher, but seeing years of his goals compressed into one big stack it became resoundingly clear how much variety and creativity he possessed, what a poised finisher he was off either foot or often most impressively, with his head.",
      "Diogo Jota wasn’t ever my favorite Red. I’ve supported the club down the years trying not to spotlight individuals anyway (but twist my arm I’d probably say, as many might, that Steven Gerrard is my all-timer). The reality is, I don’t know too many of our supporters who truly say Jota was their favorite.",
      "But what’s obvious to see is he had all the attributes, all the stardust, all the potential to be a club favorite, and he was ever really only held back by repeated injury and unavailability. If we’d delayed getting a striker this window (perhaps awaiting Isak next summer) this could’ve been the season Jota finally, deservedly went injury free and lit the league up. He had it all, he just needed luck and a truer run of games. He just needed more time.\nEric, Los Angeles CA",
      "",
      "Will normal service be resumed?\nThe untimely death of Diogo Jota and his brother was a tragedy that seemed to touch not only the whole world of football but beyond. Even fans of arch rivals seemed to, for a moment at least, suspend hostilities and pay their respects. Not that I am in any way equating the two, I do recall the British giving Baron Von Richthofen a full military funeral after he was shot down. No matter how much rivalry or animosity there might be on the surface, we can, at times, put that all to one side. Sometimes the worst of times bring out the best in people.",
      "What I am not hopeful for however is how this will all get thrown out the window the first time Liverpool play MUFC. All the sick references to Munich, Hillsborough, etc. will be trotted out. Do these people even realize what they are chanting about? How can you not be embarrassed with yourself or with that persone next to you?",
      "I cannot speak for other clubs but I am speaking directly to you MUFC fans. Is there any chance that, just for once, you can leave your invective at home? You are a human being first before you are a MUFC fan.\nAdidasmufc (The Gerrard slip is still fair game though!)",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal – £65m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £65.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "6) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper has propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "But Tottenham club expert John Wenham reckons the time it is taking to agree a fee could see Spurs given a chance of a transfer later in the summer transfer market.",

      "Wenham told Tottenham News: “Manchester United are now looking at [Ollie] Watkins..",
      "“They’re unlikely to sign Watkins and Mbeumo, and there’s also an interesting subplot here. If you remember when Tottenham tried to sign David Raya, Brentford wanted £40million.",
      "“As the window went on, nobody was paying the £40m and they ended up loaning him to Arsenal and he then joined permanently for much less than £40m. I could see that happening with Mbeumo where he becomes available at the end of the window for less.",

      "As some players arrive for pre-season while others are still going in the 2024/2025 campaign thanks to the Club World Cup, we’re looking ahead to the World Cup Proper next summer and the transfers that we reckon need to happen in the remaining few weeks of the current window for England to win the big gong.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nDespite Rashford doing everything short of donating body parts in order to force through his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona, he was third choice until about a week ago. But the Nico Williams snub has now put him in pole position for the transfer, in quite the remarkable boon for his career and England’s chances of redressing the balance of their lopsided attack.",
      "Luis Diaz can ‘agree’ to as many transfers as he likes – Liverpool didn’t want to sell him before so surely won’t now, while top target Williams has signed a new deal with Athletic Club having quite reasonably been perturbed by Barcelona’s inability to assure him that he could actually be registered to play football.",
      "Rashford faces the same grim possibility, but these things tend to work out for mega-clubs like Barcelona, and the juice is undoubtedly worth the squeeze for the United academy graduate. Having seen what he did for Villa in six months, it’s hard to imagine Rashford not being brilliant under a manager with an excellent track record of getting the best out of attacking players in a team where it appears to be impossible not to get a shedload of goal contributions as a forward. Ferran Torres got 26 last season.",
      "And while Tuchel already knows that Harry Kane will play as his No.9 with Bukayo Saka on the right and one of the 427 wonderful No.10s as his No.10, there is currently no standout candidate for that left-wing spot. The thought of Anthony Gordon starting there is hardly encouraging as things stand and Tuchel can’t make the same Gareth Southgate mistake of crowbarring a Phil Foden or Cole Palmer into that role.",
      "An in-form Rashford would be ideal and we can’t imagine a better place for him to find and maintain that form than with Barcelona.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nLiverpool aren’t currently willing to pay the £50m up front that Crystal Palace want for Guehi, but an ‘agreement in principle’ between the player and buying club, along with him ‘pushing’ for the transfer suggests a compromise will be reached.",
      "Guehi has understandable concerns over his game time at Anfield as he looks ahead to the World Cup, but has presumably come to the obvious conclusion that he will go straight into the team alongside Virgil van Dijk because a) Ibrahima Konate has made a rod for his own back through his reported desire to be the next free transfer Judas, and b) we’re not convinced Konate is all that anyway as a free-kick mannequin could be made to look half-decent next to the greatest centre-back the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "Guehi looked a bit dodgy against Latvia in March but more than proved his big-tournament worth at the Euros, and a season of Champions League football next to Big Virg would make us feel rather more at ease over what’s currently a lick-your-finger-and-raise-it-to-the-sky position.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s to Crystal Palace’s great credit that they’ve nurtured so many footballers to the point where they should be playing Champions League football, but kudos and hat tips aren’t going to win you trophies… Oh, that’s right, they already bloody won one.",
      "Europa League football came with that wonderful FA Cup win, but whether because he feels like he’s achieved everything he can and more at Palace or he’s been looking wistfully at what best pal Michael Olise’s been doing at Bayern Munich for the last year, Eze is supposedly ‘desperate’ to return to the club that released him at the age of 13.",
      "Part of us thinks “no, f*** you Arsenal, you had your chance”, but we’ve got our England hats on and surely nothing but good can come from Eze and Declan Rice playing together week in, week out.",
      "",
      "Adam Wharton – Staying at Crystal Palace\nWe are in dangerous territory assuming that Eze and Rice will form a partnership at Arsenal that can drip through to England as that sounds suspiciously like Rice in a holding midfield role akin to a tiger walking around an enclosure.",
      "Tuchel doesn’t want a caged Rice but the one who ran all over Real Madrid and embarrassed Jude Bellingham across two legs in the Champions League, but that can only happen if a quality No.6 comes through this season to set him free. We believe that man is Wharton and that the best way for him to stake his claim is to remain at Palace, which is fortunate as we’re guessing Steve Parish would want a bazillion pounds for him if Guehi and Eze are on their way out.",
      "A non-transfer but one we felt worthy of mention as it’s the glaring issue facing Tuchel right now and to offset out guilt at giving the green light to arguably our favourite Premier League team being gutted this summer.",
      "",
      "John Stones – Manchester City to Everton\nStones will likely be looking at his competition for a starting spot at Manchester City and fancy his chances. Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis have arrived and demanded a place through their displays and a battle with Manuel Akanji or Nathan Ake to play alongside Ruben Dias is one he’s frequently won.",
      "When fit, of course, which has been so rare as to put Stones in a position that City players appear to often find themselves in under Pep Guardiola, where the manager’s desire to be cautious over the fitness of the perennially injured far outstrips the reality that most footballers need to play football to get fit.",
      "We’re hoping David Moyes has got enough of the Old School still in him not to concern himself with niggles, proximity to Red Zones or that other fancy-schmancy sports science guff and play Stones if he says he’s ready to play, which we assume he will be all of the time during a season before what could be his last big tournament hurrah.",
      "He ticks the Dick Hill marquee-signing box and offers the opportunity of an England partnership forming alongside Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nRasmus Hojlund reportedly wants to stay at Manchester United having spectacularly failed to read the room and Ruben Amorim faces the prospect of the Denmark international doing sod all again up top for United next season as predictably little progress has been made on finding buyers for their overpaid crop of outcasts.",
      "No interested club is daft enough to pay full price for your Alejandro Garnachos, Antonys or Jadon Sanchos in the knowledge that the Red Devils will say yes to any offer to get them out of the club on deadline day.",
      "A £60 move for Watkins is therefore very unlikely, but Villa have shown some interest in United’s pariahs, offering hope of a swap or a separate but very definitely linked PSR-swerving dodgy deal.",
      "While we would be surprised if Watkins joined and banged in goal after goal he would at least be guaranteed a spot in the team, which was far from the case under Unai Emery last season. We want the guy who’s going to play minimal football while watching Kane at the World Cup to have played plenty during the season, thank you very much.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nMadueke was arguably England’s most impressive player against Andorra in June and could absolutely be in the mix for a starting spot next summer if he moves to Arsenal or stays at Chelsea, but this is less about him and more about Starboy.",
      "The injury which kept Bukayo Saka out for a big chunk of last season may be entirely unrelated to him being flogged by Mikel Arteta at an average of 46 games in the previous three campaigns, but as overuse injuries go, a hamstring ping is a common one.",
      "Madueke could play on Arsenal’s left in the same team as Saka but, more importantly for England, in his place on the right on occasion, to save some of his energy and dynamism for the international left-backs who need to feel the Saka pain if the Three Lions are to have any hope.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nHe’s made just four starts at No.10 since his move to Manchester City four years ago and two of his 17 goals for the Citizens have come in those games. That provides fairly good evidence of his value in that role over his typical spot under Pep Guardiola on the left wing, as did his display for England in that role vs Ireland under Lee Carsley in September, when he scored and was seen doing Jack Grealish type things we’ve been denied the joy of watching for far too long.",
      "Guardiola’s negging has given Grealish little option but to leave Manchester City and Napoli are thought to be among those most interested. We’re not quite sure how Antonio Conte might fit Grealish into a line-up with Scott McTominay and Kevin De Bruyne but now we think about it we’re not sure there’s a midfield trio we would rather watch in action.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Newcastle\nAfter his outstanding displays to drive the England U21s to Euros glory we really need to find out just how good Elliott is at football this season, and that’s only going to happen away from Liverpool.",
      "Fulham are interested but we’re guessing Elliott is setting his sights a little higher. Borussia Dortmund offers a sanctuary for lost English souls and will be an attractive option. But if Eddie Howe can – with all due respect – get nine goals and 14 assists out of Jacob Murphy in a season then Elliott must fancy his chances of staking his England claim at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Fabian Ruiz – PSG to Manchester United\nA strange one for those hoping for a revitalised Kobbie Mainoo this season and we count ourselves among those crossing our fingers that Ruben Amorim can find a suitable spot for him in his 3-4-3 to allow him to shine for the Red Devils as he did for England at Euro 2024.",
      "But Mainoo’s absence from the team thanks to Ruiz’s arrival would only be short-lived before he usurps a guy who was brilliant for England’s conquerors Spain at Euro 2024 but would arrive at the World Cup bereft of all confidence having had it sapped from him by a year at Old Trafford.",
      "Newcastle are exploring striker options to replace Callum Wilson, with Ollie Watkins and Yoane Wissa being ‘discussed’, according to reports.",
      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could reportedly pull out of a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo in order to sign another Premier League star and pressure Brentford to lower their price.",
      "Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze continues to attract interest from Premier League sides Arsenal and Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been given a double blow in their pursuit of a new striker this summer with Ollie Watkins looking difficult to land, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have no chance of agreeing a cut-price deal for Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze as Gunners hold internal discussions, according to reports."

      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Some clubs go all Football Manager with transfer clauses. Spurs are trying to find West Ham’s sweet spot over Mohammed Kudus but an apparent add-on regarding Thomas Frank’s side winning the Premier League and Champions League, as reported by talkSPORT, is unlikely to move things along.",
      "That is not the first transfer clause that a prospective selling club has rejected out of hand. Spurs themselves have previous.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes – Sporting to Spurs\nWest Ham are said to want ‘a more realistic proposal’ for Kudus which guarantees them a greater pay-out up front.",
      "At least Spurs are not now in the midst of a famous trophy drought when pledging payments to clubs in the event they win the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "They had just lost the Champions League final when Bruno Fernandes agreed to make the move to north London – but in echoes of the Viktor Gyokeres carry-on, Sporting president Frederico Varandas stood in the way.",
      "“The only serious offer was from Tottenham and that was £40m plus another £18m in bonuses for winning the Premier League and the Champions League,” he said. “Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept.”",
      "By January, Manchester United came around waving an initial £47m rising to £67.7m at the Portuguese club, who were more amenable to clauses such as Champions League qualification and making 25 starts.",
      "",
      "Declan Rice – West Ham to Arsenal\nWest Ham do not tend to mess around with the old Premier League and Champions League-winning clauses either.",
      "Their laborious staring contest with Arsenal over a move everyone knew would go through involved half-hearted Manchester City hijacks and incessant grumbling over payment structures.",
      "The Gunners had a couple of offers rejected, with one including add-ons for winning either of the two big ones and Rice playing a certain percentage of games.",
      "In the end the £5m add-ons attached to a £100m deal were for the Hammers to receive £1m each time Arsenal simply qualified for the Champions League with Rice starting 60% of games.",
      "Two payments down, three to go.",
      "",
      "Sadio Mane – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nWhile the perennial German champions did eventually get their man, it took a bit more finesse than one might expect.",
      "Mane wanted the move for a fresh challenge and Liverpool were happy to oblige in a continued restructuring of their attack, but Bayern had to get serious first.",
      "After an opening offer of £21m plus an extra £4m in add-ons was scoffed at by Liverpool, Bayern came back to the table with, as reported by the well-connected Paul Joyce of The Times, a bid which could theoretically reach £30m.",
      "Fair enough. That seems like a perfectly sensible progression in negotiations.",
      "Oh hold on. It would have only hit that top figure if Bayern won the Champions League and Mane the Ballon d’Or. Over each season of his three-year contract. So an extra £6.5m in return for Mane becoming the third player to win three consecutive Ballons d’Or simultaneously with Bayern completing only the second Champions League threepeat in history. Sounds about right.",
      "Mane only ended up staying in Bavaria for a single year, with Bayern eliminated in the Champions League quarter-finals as the Senegalese struggled. No wonder Liverpool mocked those ‘laughable’ bonuses.",
      "",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka – Crystal Palace to Man Utd\nThere were a couple of clauses contained within the final deal which saw Wan-Bissaka leave Crystal Palace for Man Utd.",
      "The former likely abandoned any hope of receiving 10% of any subsequent sale of the right-back for more than £50m long before he moved to West Ham for £15m.",
      "More plausible is that 190 appearances for Man Utd supplemented that initial £45m fee with £5m worth of add-ons.",
      "But Man Utd would have had other contingencies written into the transfer if things had gone their way. It was reported during protracted negotiations that Palace were ‘unimpressed’ by the nature of the performance-related clauses, one of which was known to be an additional payment if Wan-Bissaka made 25 Champions League appearances for a club which had just qualified for the Europa League; he has been stuck on 15 since December 2023.",
      "Some outlets went one further and suggested that Man Utd pledged more money if they won the Champions League, despite not advancing beyond the quarter-finals since 2011. In Palace’s eyes, that was fairly accurately deemed by The Guardian ‘to be wildly unrealistic’.",

      "Hugo Ekitike – Reims to Newcastle\n“Newcastle positioned themselves, we discussed it, they made us an offer that did not suit us,” said Reims president Jean-Pierre Caillot of Hugo Ekitike in January 2022.",
      "“As we do not really want him to leave, we have fixed the price quite high. They did offer us €35m all in, but with a number of bonuses, some of them quasi-impossible to reach. Like for example, winning the Champions League. We want €30m flat and €10m in achievable bonuses.”",
      "The Ligue Un club were far more receptive to a summer approach. Newcastle had expected to complete a deal for striker Ekitike worth €36m, plus €10m in what were described by French sources as far more ‘easily attainable’ bonuses. Perhaps they started with just qualifying for the Champions League first.",
      "But an injury put the move in doubt and the Magpies moved on to other targets long before Paris Saint-Germain swooped. Eddie Howe probably doesn’t regret waiting a little longer for Alexander Isak instead.",

      "Jadon Sancho – Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd\nAfter successfully reeling in Monaco with an add-on worth £7.6m if Anthony Martial finished on a Ballon d’Or podium, Man Utd repeated the trick with Bruno Fernandes four-and-a-half years later. They will owe Sporting Lisbon £4.2m for each of the first three times the Portuguese is named PFA Player of the Year or takes a spot in the Ballon d’Or top three. The current tally stands at zero in either case.",
      "United tried it again when it came to those complicated talks with Borussia Dortmund over Sancho. Despite having ‘forced the Germans’ into selling the winger in August 2020, Sancho inexplicably remained at the Westfalenstadion for almost 12 more months.",
      "Thirteen days after the delayed Euro 2020 final, in which the England international missed a shootout penalty, Man Utd finally had their man. But not before Dortmund shot down any idea of the overall fee being enhanced by that typical bonus due if Sancho finished high in the Ballon d’Or vote.",
      "As an aside, the last Man Utd player to take a podium place in Ballon d’Or voting was 2008 winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who also finished second in 2007. Before then, it was 1999 runner-up David Beckham, Eric Cantona’s third place in 1993 and then bronze for George Best in 1971. It’s hardly a regular occurrence.",

      "Kieran Tierney – Celtic to Arsenal\nAround the time Tierney was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a knee injury that required surgery in early April 2022, Arsenal might have felt they had already established a substantial enough lead in the pursuit of Champions League qualification.",
      "The Gunners were fourth, four and six points clear of Man Utd and West Ham respectively, with a game in hand on both. Tottenham were a place further back and six points behind, with the north London rivals having 10 games left each.",
      "It should have been sewn up but Arsenal’s form collapsed, in part because of the reshuffling which Tierney’s absence forced. Arsenal lost three consecutive games to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, then won four on the trot before imploding against Spurs and Newcastle to confirm their slip to fifth.",
      "Celtic never believed in them. It was during talks over Tierney when the Scottish giants, having already rejected a £15m bid for the left-back, scoffed at the structure of a further £25m offer. One of the clauses pertained to Arsenal, Europa League runners-up at the time, qualifying for the Champions League.",

      "‘Palace offered an initial £23.5 million with a further £7 million in add-ons. Those additional clauses included £2.5 million should Palace qualify for the Champions League with Benteke scoring 20 goals and playing in 70 per cent of the fixtures of such a top-four campaign. These three conditions formed part of the same clause.’",
      "It turns out ‘this was not considered realistic on Merseyside’. Idiots.",
      "Just four days later, Alan Pardew praised a “brave” club-record deal worth £27m, plus £5m in presumably more sensible add-ons.",
      "Palace only finished 10 places and 35 points off fourth place – Liverpool, funnily enough – with Benteke scoring 15 goals that season. But he did play 94.7% of their games. So, so close.",

      "A Man Utd midsummer panic\nSo we reach the fabled ‘back in training day’ for Manchester United. And as a generally optimistic chap, this is the first time since INEOS took over that I’m nearing panic stations. And by that I mean dreading the drifting malaise and apathy that will come with following United for the foreseeable.",
      "If we take a brief stroll down memory lane, we had ETH who had a terrible season but had some leeway because the squad he was managing – largely due to a ridiculous injury list – couldn’t actually field XI decent players in the right positions for two weeks in a row. He was then given a couple months with some fit players and it went pear-shaped and instead we got a systems-coach in. Which made sense given INEOS’ clear indication that we’d be spending in our means and these big, manager-led signings were over.",
      "So Amorim arrives and is given leeway because his system very clearly needs excellent wing backs of which United have literally none. Fine INEOS, you wanted your man, this is longer-term thinking. More leeway from fans. A single signing in January alleviates a small piece of the problem, but United still start most weeks with a past-it central midfielder and no options up front. But more leeway is given because INEOS are going to sort the summer out, and United are finally going to start the second half of the open-heart surgery Ralf wanted.",
      "And here we are. Probably the most-challenging opening few months of any team in the league. A manager we’ve heard for almost a year needs a great pre-season with his players. A system that we’ve heard for multiple years needs new blood, more athleticism and just more numbers. A season that is absolutely crucial to the club’s future. And what have INEOS achieved? They paid a release clause.",

      "Dark times for Arsenal for serious reasons\nThis weekend, a lot of Arsenal fans had to wrestle with some very uncomfortable truths, about our football club, and how it conducted itself regarding a player who has been charged with a most heinous series of crimes.",
      "Let me be clear, I believe the way the club behaved regarding Thomas Partey was reprehensible, and has tarnished the reputation of both the club and the fans too. Now, not everyone is terminally online, following this discourse, so it is quite possible that many Arsenal fans had no idea that the club was protecting a potential sex offender, however many hundreds of thousands did. We all saw the same social media posts by the victims, we all knew who the police were alluding to. For me, the most shameful part is that they tried to renew his contract, knowing all this. Why would you do this?",
      "I can’t believe I’m about to type this, but Stewie is right in this regard. How can the club talk about community when they circle the wagons for people accused of such crimes? How can we celebrate our amazing women’s team when this is how the club treats other women? How was this allowed to happen? Were they so scared about the value of an asset that they’d rather burn our reputation to protect someone else’s reputation. Someone who has cast a dark shadow over our club?",
      "I don’t know the complexities of employment law, contracts, etc, but the club should have dropped him the moment he was accused, but they didn’t. There needs to be a top down review about how these decisions were made, who made them, and they are held to account.",

      "The problem with Arsenal’s left-hand side has been their team setup and use of inverted LBs and a lack of a decent/fixed Left 8.

MLS at left back has improved the situation somewhat there is still way to much inverting.\nNick",

It’s not hard to suffer potential financial/career hardship when you would be a) in the right for refusing to pick him, and b) you’re already a multi-millionaire.

      "Trying to see the positives in Jota\nIt’s been a few days, I’ve read the mailboxes and Johnny Nic but haven’t been able to bring myself to read some of the longer form pieces about Diogo Jota. It’s just too heartbreaking, and feels too soon. As many have said, he only knew of me in the collective, as one of millions of LFC supporters, but nonetheless his death in many ways feels like the loss of a close friend. We invest so much in our clubs & these players so something like this is a shock and it hurts.",
      "Thanks to the intervention of autoplay, the recent episode of The Athletic’s LFC podcast came up and I ended up listening to them memorialize Jota. More than once they hit on the tragedy of Diogo being taken just as he hit the prime of his life – winning a league title with his club, winning a Nations League with his country, and most importantly marrying his childhood sweetheart. All of which are especially cruel.",
      "But listening to that episode, and reflecting on my own personal losses, I am going to (try to) see the positive in this. My mother passed away a little over a year ago, only about a week after I moved from NYC to London. She had been in cancer treatment for a couple years, and the last 6 months of her life were clinical trials and experimental treatments, none of which were able to help. One of the main things to give us comfort, which doesn’t apply at all here, is that we all knew the end was coming and she was fully at peace with it. She encouraged me to make the move, and as a result of some timing issues I ended up living with my parents in Upstate NY for a month and I absolutely wouldn’t trade that time for anything in the world.",
      "The other silver lining which gave us peace, is that she got to have all of the major experiences she wanted out of life. My parents were married for 43 years and got to do a bit of traveling in retirement before her life was dominated by appointments and treatments. My sister got married about 3 years ago, so she got to experience the joy of one of her children getting married.",
      "About a year after that, she was overjoyed at the news that my sister was pregnant. And while she was in the end stages of her own life when my niece arrived, my mom got to be a grandmother. I can only imagine the physical pain she was quietly going through but I have never seen my mom as happy as when she held her grandchild.",
      "There is such a sense of cruelty in Diogo passing away just as he was going through the prime of his professional life and hitting these personal milestones, which cuts deep for many but especially those closest to him. He had so much in life ahead of him, but I am going to try to take peace knowing that he and his family got to experience those recent highs while he was alive and hope that someday they are able to do the same.",
      "It took me a long time to get that perspective, in part because of the ability to mentally prepare and to say goodbye while Mom was still with us. I hope they reach a similar comfort in the future and that they always know the love that the LFC, Wolves, Portugal, Pacos de Ferreira communities (among others) hold for Diogo, Andre, and their entire family.\nDanny, LFC NY"

They’ve been with Macron in recent years, but we have been unable to track down details of the length of that contract. Another TBC in terms of both the kit itself and more importantly its ranking, then.",

There appears to even be some doubt about the manufacturer, with some ferociously ugly mock-ups featuring supposed adidas efforts despite our understanding being that Bournemouth still have a year left on their deal with Umbro.",

      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "16) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",

      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "9) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",

      "8) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "5) Nottingham Forest\nWe’re still working from leaks here, so it’s a gamble putting this so high but the pinstripes as well as the shield surrounding the badge and the clear nods to the 92-94 kit mean this has all the hallmarks of an absolute banger.",
      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",
      "The new home kit – that’s shirt, shorts and socks – in one shot. pic.twitter.com/PdexDvPJo7",
      "— KUMB.com: West Ham United FC Online (@kumbdotcom) July 3, 2025",
      "The return of the full colour club crest is good after last year’s experiment with keeping it to the club’s primary colours, which we didn’t hate but have to now concede doesn’t look as good as this one does.",
      "The striped collars and cuffs are first-rate, and the flashes of blue under the arms are just enough to avoid this falling into the Burnley trap.",
      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

      "2) Manchester United\nYour mileage may vary, but personally we’re fans of predominantly black trim on a Manchester United shirt, and that feels even more important this year with Liverpool also back in the adidas fold. You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 1, 2025",
      "This shirt certainly has that, and perhaps our favourite collar of the entire season’s efforts. In a world of plain round collars, United have a double-element v-neck that – and we have no idea whether this is intentional or not but to our mind it’s a bonus – brings to mind the devil’s trident from their badge.",
      "Having praised the black, though, we’re not quite sure at first glance about what seem some very shiny black adidas stripes on the shoulders and sleeves. They’re slightly off-putting – notably on the long-sleeve version.",
      "There’s also a print woven into the sleeves rather than body of the shirt, which is an unusual choice but one that works here. The last United home shirt we can recall with sleeves that differed from the main body of the shirt was 1998/99, and that seemed to work out well for everybody.",
      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",
      "Hilarious japes aside, excellent shirt this. Unmistakably United, significantly different to – and we’re going to say better than – Liverpool’s own adidas effort.",
      "",
      "1) Leeds United\nFor some reason that baffles and – if we’re honest – infuriates us, adidas have apparently decided in the last year or so to devote a lot of their very best work to Leeds United.",
      "Last year’s away kit was an all-timer, and this year’s home kit for their Premier League return even manages to nail our least favourite trend – the local inspiration.",

      "We will not be granted the purest joy of an access-all-areas documentary covering Manchester United’s 2025/2026 season after Ruben Amorim eruditely chose not to give the green light to a new Amazon ‘All or Nothing’ series.",
      "Amorim is currently involved in a stuttering squad rebuild after picking up the pieces of the worst Red Devils season in living memory, and doesn’t want a television crew documenting his second campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "That’s according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein, who claims after ‘several months of negotiating a deal with Amazon’ at the end of last season, United have ‘withdrawn from secret talks’ after ‘concluding it could distract from the progress of the first team’.",
      "Amorim is said to be the driving force behind ‘pulling the plug’ on the deal which would have seen United earn ‘significantly more than £10m’ as the platform’s largest ever payment for an ‘All or Nothing’ series after previous editions followed Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim made clear he was not comfortable with the potential intrusion on the first team — while aspects of the commercial agreement and the time pressure of the upcoming season were factors, too’, the report states.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘United presented the proposal to Amorim after the end of the season and, having received his feedback, the board received a unified recommendation at its Executive Committee to drop the idea.",
      "‘The Amazon proposal would have lightened financial concerns and United’s business side, including INEOS and the club’s chief executive Omar Berrada, were supportive of it.",
      "‘Upon being informed of the potential arrangement, Amorim — who has experienced a difficult start to life at United — made clear he did not believe such a project to be appropriate or beneficial to the first team at present. He felt it would be an unwelcome distraction in an environment that has had many problems in recent years.’",
      "Amorim’s refusal comes as no surprise as he currently looks set for another hugely challenging season at the Old Trafford helm.",

      "Their struggles to sign players is only outstripped by their inability to sell them, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho all so obviously available that no club in their right mind would make an offer this early in the window in the knowledge that United will get desperate as the days tick by.",
      "Why are giving Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim excuses to be terrible? Plus, more on Spurs, Arsenal and Diogo Jota.",

      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",

      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
