      "Chelsea midfielder Dario Essugo has revealed his huge debt of gratitude to Ruben Amorim. It was the Manchester United boss who gave Essugo’s career lift-off when they were together at Sporting Lisbon and made him one of Europe’s most sought after young players.",
      "Former Sporting boss Amorim gave Essugo his debut in the Champions League when he was just 16 years and 268 days, making him the Portuguese club’s youngest debutant in the competition.",
      "Essugo, 20, joined Chelsea in the summer for £18.5m and will always be grateful for Amorim for putting him in the first team after just ONE training session. Portugal under-21 star Essugo said: “He brought me to the first team so he helped me a lot, to understand the game, to reach the level I am here now.",
      "“I am grateful. He is so demanding. He is a demanding person. He likes to win every time so he has helped me a lot. I made one training session with the first team and the coach Ruben Amorim likes what he saw and he called me to play.",
      "“I didn’t expect to play because at this time there was Covid and I wasn’t playing anything because the Champions League had stopped. We had good players like Manuel Ugarte, João Palhinha and now Morten Hjulmand.",
      "“They are three big players. I had the opportunity to learn with one of them and of course this for me was a big opportunity.”",
      "Essugo says he learned a lot from those players and Amorim but also wants to be his own man rather than be compared to players like Claude Makelele or Michael Essien and N’Golo Kante who have obvious similarities.",
      "He said: “To be honest, I never saw Makelele on TV but the people told me a lot about Makelele and say I have some similar parts of his game. They are big players. I want to make my own way but also like to see Makelele, Essien and Kante, to follow their steps.",
      "“I always play as a midfielder but also I am a defensive midfielder but I also like to go forward with the ball, box to box. Of course it is good when they compare you with a very big player but it is a mix of both because I want to try to have my way, to achieve the top.”",
      "And when Chelsea came calling this summer, there was never any doubt in Essugo’s mind about where to go. His dad now manages his career after a career in construction while his mum works in a kitchen.",
      "Now Essugo wants to cook up something special at Stamford Bridge and says Enzo Maresca has also been hugely positive since he arrived. He added: “Chelsea helped my parents so many times. I feel very good. When my father said Chelsea want me to come here, of course I can’t say no.",
      "“I am learning with the coach, the players, the midfielders here. Enzo has a different idea of football like all the managers. But I always to try catch what he wants. Romeo Lavia is so calm I learn so much from him.",
      "“It is a different level. The players are amazing. Before, when I was at Las Palmas and Sporting, they had very big players but for me it is an amazing feeling to be here.”",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe took his initial 27.7percent share of Manchester United, the top line was that he would be taking charge of football operations. Turns out ‘football operations’ included sacking office staff and giving ticket prices a hike after a season that included EIGHTEEN Premier League defeats.",
      "And just for effect, news of the increases came on a day when the fixtures for the next Premier League season were published - a day that should be about hope and optimism and about wiping the slate clean. Increasingly, Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group are becoming the embodiment of people who know how to make billions out of business but are clueless when it comes to winning the hearts of minds of a football club’s fanbase.",
      "Perhaps they are not overly interested in hearts and minds, perhaps they really are only interested in money. After all, it will take many, many more years - possibly decades - of underachievement on the field of play before United loses its allure as one of sport’s most iconic institutions.",
      "That might be a hard notion for rival supporters to stomach but that is fact. United could probably double ticket prices and still sell Old Trafford out.",
      "The crowd’s demographic would be different - there would be a lot of tourists around - but they would still fill the stadium. And they would probably fill a new one seating 100,000.",
      "But these ticket prices are not particularly jaw-dropping in scale, to be honest. The Manchester United Fans’ Advisory Board even said: “We are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.”",
      "But that same group had called for a ticket-price freeze that they “felt was justified due to the current circumstances.” And that is the point.",
      "After the season United had - ending in the dismal Europa League final defeat - asking fans to pay more for the privilege of watching a strictly mediocre team almost smacks of having a laugh at the supporters’ expense. It smacks of doing it because they know they can.",
      "It is common for clubs, for ticket pricing purposes, to categorise games, but on the evidence of their performances at Old Trafford last season, is ANY game involving this United side a Category A match? But there are six Category A games at Old Trafford next season - against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur - and tickets for those fixtures range from £59 to £97.",
      "No matter what your take on the scale of the increases - and United are certainly not the only club to do this - it is the fact the increases come against a backdrop of players under-performing hugely for hugely over-inflated salaries. It comes against a backdrop of the Glazers having taken out millions and millions in dividends over the period of their ownership.",
      "And it is simply hard to believe that, as a nod towards United’s fantastic support, the club and Sir Jim and INEOS could not have stood a season in which ticket prices remained the same. Actually, scrap that.",
      "It is not hard to believe. It is easy. Because these people know a lot about business but little about being a football fan.",

      "The 27-year-old is returning to Old Trafford after his loan stint away at Aston Villa. Rashford has endured a difficult time in Manchester and, after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim, opted to move away temporarily.",
      "Villa had a £40million option to sign him permanently but that hasn't been exercised and Rashford faces an uncertain future. His dream move to Barcelona may now be off the cards - despite his thinly-veiled come-get-me-plea - and the forward appears to be selling himself as the central striker that United are looking for.",
      "Rashford has played predominantly from out wide during his career, but believes becoming a central option has been part of his career evolution. Those in Manchester have missed out on Liam Delap, one of their summer targets, whilst Viktor Gyokeres may favour other destinations.",
      "It could yet leave an opening for Rashford to stake his claim as the man to lead United's line - something he believes he's now capable of. He said: \"For me as I've got older, the No.9 position is becoming more comfortable, more natural.\"",
      "In Rashford's most prolific season he scored 30 times. That was back in 2022/23 under Erik ten Hag. He's failed to hit those heights since but looked back to his best for periods during his loan spell at Villa, where he was able to dislodge Ollie Watkins as a stater.",
      "The main task for the academy graduate will be winning over Amorim. The Portuguese coach, who has signed Matheus Cunha and now wants Bryan Mbeumo, quickly shunned Rashford when he arrived and left him out of numerous squads. He later cited a difference of opinion as their main issue.",
      "He said: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",

      "Mbeumo, 25, is all ready and has agreed to move to United if the Red Devils can seal a deal with his club side, Brentford. So far, United have seen two offers turned down by the London club, while Tottenham - who have just poached Bees boss Thomas Frank - have made a bid in excess of anything offered by United.",
      "Nevertheless, despite interest from Spurs, United are expected to land Mbeumo, with his preference to move to Old Trafford.",
      "He will join Matheus Cunha, who has already completed his £62.5m move from Wolves, with the pair both earmarked for key roles by Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese is sticking wholeheartedly with his 3-4-3 formation which is yet to bear fruit in Manchester, with the pair both set for starting spots as the twin No.10s, either side of a No.9.",
      "That means that Amad, one of few shining lights during a dismal 2024-25 campaign is likely to miss out on his preferred position on the right of the attacking trio. He may well have to drop back and play at wing-back if he wants to keep a starting spot, or else be a substitute.",
      "Speculation has risen however that he could in fact be cast aside and sold, as the club look to recoup funds. But Saha has urged United chiefs to do whatever it takes to keep Amad.",

If there are one or two players who should not leave, it is him and Bruno Fernandes,\" Saha told the Daily Express with BetSelect. \"He is the kind of player who does not care where he plays.

The striker quickly made his name in football with a famous late winner for Everton against Arsenal in the Premier League in October 2002 after emerging through the club's academy.",

      "Osimhen's refusal to join the Premier League side stemmed from the fact they then had Odion Ighalo on their books. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer raised eyebrows when he went and signed the former Watford man to address the team's attacking issues.",
      "Ighalo had a bright start, but quickly tailed off and his record by the time he left Manchester stood at five goals in 23 games. That said, he was one of the senior Nigerian players of his generation and Osimhen had great respect for the player who was nine years his senior.",

      "Osimhen's brother, Andrew, told Complete Sports: \"It is very true that Manchester United wanted Victor, but he told me something like he had too much respect for Odion Ighalo to be competing for shirts with his senior colleague.

      "Cunha is set to play in one of the two roles that sit behind the frontman. Who that will be still needs to be determined. Viktor Gyokeres has flirted with a move but doesn't seem to be keen at present. It is clear that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee aren't what the team need currently.",
      "United's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo is well documented. Brentford have rejected their opening offers with Tottenham, who now have Thomas Frank at the helm, hoping they can swoop in and seal a move for the Cameroonian. He's just enjoyed the best year of his career and is tipped to move on, but still favours a switch to Manchester.",

      "He was pushed out of loan last term, scoring regularly at Galatasaray, and he's turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia which underlines his desire to remain in Europe. Osimhen has just 12 months left on his deal meaning he could be available for less than his market value.",
      "At the other end of the pitch Andre Onana is still yet to convince despite having two years in between the sticks. He has continued to come up with errors and was even dropped by Amorim last term. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is a man who is linked with pastures new.",
      "He appeared to say his goodbyes and cut an emotional figure on his last outing at Villa Park. Rumours have mounted that United are keen, and their interest is reciprocated by the Argentina No 1 himself whilst Monaco are understood to be keen on Onana.",
      "In front of the goalkeeper, despite potentially wanting to bolster his defensive line, Amorim may have to stick with what he's got. United ultimately don't have a bottomless pit of cash and if they landed Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen and Martinez it would take them beyond the £200m mark.",
      "Those signings could yet be aided by some significant departures with Alejandro Garnacho being among the most significant.

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot is making up for lost time this summer after opening the transfer floodgates at Anfield. And it has taken the Dutchman just a few weeks to break the rule predecessor Jurgen Klopp sought to adhere to above all others in the market.",
      "Klopp, 58, previously made a point of stressing his morals when it came to keeping Liverpool financially solvent. And that meant not necessarily spending on a par with the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, who copped criticism from the former Reds boss for their free-spending ways in the past.",
      "Of course that changed over time as Liverpool made allowances in opening their chequebook so Klopp could compete. But the German was staunchly against spending £100million fees on individuals when he first arrived at Anfield – a line Liverpool have now crossed with the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal worth up to £116m, with £100m of that being guaranteed.",
      "\"If you bring one player in for £100m or whatever and he gets injured then it all goes through the chimney,\" Klopp warned back in 2016 after United forked out £89m to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \"The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together.",
      "\"That is why somebody invented passes so these players can play together. It’s not about running with the ball because you can do it all the time. Building the group is not my unique idea – it is necessary to be successful in football.",
      "\"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. Do I have to do it differently to that? I don’t know exactly how much money we could spend because nobody has told me up to this point, ‘No, no, no you can’t do this.’",
      "\"If I spend money it is because I am trying to build a real team. You can win championships, you can win titles. But maybe there is a manner in which you want it. It is about how it is.\"",
      "The Merseysiders have added 22-year-old Wirtz to their armoury and could have to shell out as much as £116m if certain conditions are met. And that addition means Liverpool have now spent more money in this window than any other in their history to date.",
      "Slot recruited Jeremie Frimpong (also from Leverkusen) for £29.5m earlier in the summer, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined from Valencia for an initial £25m, along with £4m in add-ons – with that deal agreed last summer counting towards their 2025 spending. Not only that, but a £40m move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also in the pipeline.",
      "Provided the Kerkez deal goes through as expected, that would take Liverpool's total spend this summer to roughly £215m (providing all bonus clauses are met). And despite the fact the transfer window has been open for less than one month, that would far eclipse the previous record for total spend in any other window.",
      "The closest Klopp came to matching that sum was in the summer of 2018 when he spent around £170m on new signings. That included Alisson from Roma (£65m), Naby Keita from RB Leipzig (£53m), Fabinho from Monaco (£39m) and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke (£13.5m), though the investments paid off as they won the Champions League that season.",
      "Eventually, Klopp wasn't too far from overseeing a couple of nine-digit deals himself, considering Liverpool signed Virgil van DIjk and Darwin Nunez for £75m and £85m, respectively. Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in football history at the time of his move from Southampton, and Klopp later walked back his comments concerning exorbitant transfer fees.",
      "\"These kind of things happen. When you want to sign a striker as exciting as Darwin is, that’s the market and you have to pay the price,\" he conceded in 2023. \"I said so many things in my life and life caught me then later and showed me that my imagination was obviously not clear enough for how quickly life can change. That’s how it is.",
      "\"After that [comment about Pogba], we bought a centre-half for quite a decent fee [£75m for Van Dijk], we bought a goalie for quite a decent fee [Alisson]. Our situation is always the same, we try to level it somehow [with sales], the things we invest in the boys and in the players we sell, it’s kind of that it’s not going out of any kind of range and that worked so far, but I know, I heard it immediately.\"",
      "To Slot's credit, he won the Premier League in his debut campaign despite barely spending at all last summer. It's only fair that one, therefore, takes into account that spread of cost, which brings his net spend to a more modest £100m or so per summer window so far."

      "United skipper Fernandes was the only shining light in a dark season for Ruben Amorim's side, one which saw them finish the campaign down in 15th place.",
      "The Red Devils lost 18 of their 38 Premier League games and failed to secure European football for only the second time in 35 years, after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham.",
      "Despite such a shocking season, Fernandes has been honoured by his fellow professionals, with the 30-year-old making the six-man shortlist for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award.",
      "Fernandes is up against Liverpool duo Mo Salah and Alexis MacAllister, as well as Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice and Chelsea forward Cole Palmer.",
      "United skipper Fernandes scored eight goals in 36 league appearances last season and 19 in all competitions. The award will be presented at a ceremony in Manchester on August 19.",
      "The last time a United player won the accolade was Wayne Rooney in 2010, with Manchester City and England forward Phil Foden the current holder.",
      "Fernandes considered leaving United this summer, after being approached by Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal over a move that would have trebled his current £300,000-a-week salary.",
      "But after discussing the potential move with his wife, Ana Pinho, Fernandes decided to reject the lucrative proposal and commit his future to United.",
      "\"The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there,\" said Fernandes. \"I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I've always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on. I spoke with the coach, Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.",
      "\"Manchester United said they didn't want to sell me. They said if I wanted to go I could, but they didn't need the money. From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.",

Then Red Devils head coach Erik ten Hag blamed profit and sustainability rules for the sale of the midfielder, admitting he had mixed feelings about the deal.",

      "\"Scott is a player whom I knew really well. He was born and raised at Manchester United,\" Conte told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"I could see that he always made an impact when he played, but at the same time, I noticed he wasn't used as a key player at Manchester United.",
      "\"He was hardly a starter. Honestly, we had talked about it with [Napoli director] Giovanni Manna. He told me it was a possible solution.",

      "Eager to add ‘captains and leaders’, Amorim is described as a ‘long-term admirer’ of the Villa shot-stopper, which may urge him to change his stance on retaining Onana as his first choice.",
      "But Villa’s £40m asking price may well prove to be a barrier for United, with the club in the market for new players in multiple positions after their worst season in living memory and with not a great deal of spare cash to spend given their failure to qualify for Europe as a result of that dreadful campaign.",
      "With that in mind, they’ve reportedly made an opening bid of €15m [£12.8m] for Lunin, who impressed for Los Blancos last season as he covered for the injured Thibaut Courtois, but has found himself back on the sidelines this term following the Belgium international’s return to full fitness.",
      "Lunin recently extended his Madrid contract to 2030 but did so ‘on the condition of reviewing his situation at the end of the season’, which prompted United to hold ‘conversations’ with Lunin’s agent, Jorge Mendes, and make the bid, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "That opening offer has been ‘rejected’ by the La Liga giants, who reportedly value the 26-year-old at €20m [£17m].",
      "There’s also said to be interest from AC Milan in Lunin as ‘a new round of talks is expected’ between Chelsea and the Serie A side over a deal for Mike Maignan after the Blues made a £12.8m bid for the France international which fell short of Milan’s £20m valuation.",

      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "This is an inexhaustive list of players with release clauses which could actually viably be triggered from summer 2025 onwards. We are talking sub-£100m, not your daft £1bn La Liga jobs.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "But Leeds, West Ham and a handful of others are yet to act on their interest, perhaps because of his wage demands and obvious curse.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015.",
      "He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something. But also it sounds like he’s off to Napoli.",
      "",
      "Jhon Lucumi\nAston Villa and Bournemouth are sniffing around Bologna defender Lucumi, with Roma also contemplating a move for the 26-year-old who will only come as cheap as £23.9m until July 10.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nAston Villa and Crystal Palace are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago.",
      "Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",
      "",
      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco.",
      "The centre-half has attracted interest from the Hammers, Crystal Palace, Sevilla and Wolfsburg in his £16.7m release clause.",
      "",
      "Jan Bednarek\nAny club desperate to sign a centre-half with two recent relegations on his CV can do so for the cheap old price of £6m.",
      "",
      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is practically certain that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain.",
      "The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests, but more pertinently to convince the club’s hierarchy that the finances involved are worth it.",
      "By all accounts it is a battle he has conceded, leaving Barcelona to agree personal terms before overcoming the obstacle of working out how they are actually going to pay for him.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham for £9m and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\nAnother Arsenal target – to the chagrin of many supporters – but really any aspiring team in world football will have at least taken a look at Gyokeres before wincing ever so slightly at that £86m release clause.",
      "Sporting might not hold out for that much but are among the best sellers across the globe and will back themselves to get the best possible deal.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus\nAfter this season especially, it feels unlikely that any club will meet the £85m release clause written into the West Ham contract of Kudus. It is even higher for Saudi Arabian clubs, who do indeed have their limits.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",
      "",
      "Thierno Barry\nAn option for Everton in their brave new era under David Moyes, it will be interesting to see if the Toffees can find the requisite £34m to bring 22-year-old centre-forward Barry in from Villarreal, for whom he has scored 11 goals in 37 games.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola\nBournemouth quietly fell off towards the end of the season to bring their dream of European qualification combined with FA Cup glory crashing back down to reality. But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause. Spurs have at least removed themselves from the equation.",
      "Man Utd have accepted defeat in the Viktor Gyokeres chase – for now – as Arsenal weigh up a move for the Sporting striker or Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Marcus Rashford could yet reportedly sign with Aston Villa, as he and the club were ‘happy’ with the signing and there are two deals in the works which could prompt ...",

      "Salia will join upon his 18th birthday in August, before which the Magpies will be thoroughly exploring possible loan avenues for a player who has scored seven goals in 39 first-team games.",

Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall are basically grey-haired, grizzled veterans at this stage after pulling through an injury crisis for Ange Postecoglou, and they will soon be showing the likes of Vuskovic and Melia the ropes.",
      "They will have to wait slightly longer in the case of Melia, whose move as the League of Ireland’s record sale cannot be officially ratified until he turns 18 because Brexit.",
      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Geovany Quenda (Sporting to Chelsea, £42.1m, June 2026)\nManchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",
      "Of course there is a seven-year contract, add-ons and a sell-on clause.",
      "",
      "Dastan Satpaev (Kairat Almaty to Chelsea, £3.3m, August 2026)\nIt is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, £100m)\nIt’s done. Liverpool have smashed their transfer record, which could rise by another £16m. It’s the biggest transfer of the 2025 summer window and surely won’t be usurped.",
      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Liverpool (x2), Manchester United (x2), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1)",
      "Total cost: £989.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

      "There is a surprise Premier League candidate leading the race to sign Arsenal and Manchester United-linked Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Serbian international is reportedly available for transfer this summer, having failed to live up to the £70million fee the Old Lady paid Fiorentina in 2022.",
      "Arsenal were extremely interested in signing the 25-year-old during that winter window, but he understandably chose to stay in Italy.",
      "He may live to regret that decision, with Mikel Arteta’s side in a far healthier state than Juventus — though he has at least picked up a trophy with the Serie A giants.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "It’s been reported that Vlahovic could be available for as little as £40m, with his contract set to expire next June.",
      "There’s interest from Italian rivals AC Milan, while Manchester United have also been thrown into the mix.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is desperate to sign an out-and-out centre-forward amid the struggles of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, and United could do a lot worse than Vlahovic at that price.",
      "And incredibly, a fresh report from our friends over at TEAMtalk says Juventus’ asking price could drop as low as €30m (£25.6m).",
      "Transfer expert Rudy Galetti claims Igor Tudor’s side will make one final attempt to renew Vlahovic’s contract, but if he doesn’t sign, he’ll be available for around that figure this summer.",
      "Vlahovic earns over £200,000 a week in Turin — wages too steep for Milan — though Juve are still willing to sell within Serie A.",
      "The striker’s representatives are shopping him around and have already attracted plenty of Premier League interest.",
      "Surprisingly, Nottingham Forest have emerged as the ‘favourites’ to sign Vlahovic as Man United consider other options.",
      "His ‘heart is set on a move to the Premier League’, and it’s Forest who are ‘leading the race for his signature’.",
      "They’re described as ‘the most concrete option’ for the Serbian, who ‘will only join Milan if no English club presents a convincing project — including in terms of wages’.",
      "He is in ‘no rush’ at the moment and is awaiting contact from ‘top Premier League clubs’.",
      "Forest will play in the Europa Conference League next season after finishing seventh in the Premier League, and the signing of Vlahovic would be a real statement of intent.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has been rewarded for an incredible season with a new contract.",
      "Having guided the club into Europe for the first time since 1995/96, Nuno said: “I am delighted to be able to continue our journey at this fantastic football club.",
      "“Since we arrived at Forest, we have worked extremely hard to create a special bond between the players, the fans and everyone at the club, which helped us achieve great things last season.",
      "“I would like to thank our owner, Mr Marinakis, for his constant support and backing. It is important to me to share a strong relationship with our ownership and we have thoroughly enjoyed working together ever since I arrived at Forest.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "16) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Rodrigo Muniz – Fulham to Leeds\nLeeds have gone hard for Muniz – but not hard enough. Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "11) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "10) Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. Zubimendi is in London and Arsenal have always been confident.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m."

The winger didn’t do much for Fulham and cost them a loan fee, whereas he did not for Leicester and had a more memorable spell at the King Power, which is why this move ranks a bit lower.",

      "41) Orel Mangala (Nottingham Forest)\nMangala joined from Stuttgart and managed two goal contributions in 27 league matches in 2022/23. Forest got themselves out of a PSR pickle by selling him to Lyon, who gave him to Everton for the season.",

      "39) Jordan Beyer (Burnley)\nBurnley bought Beyer from Borussia Monchengladbach after a solid season on loan, helping them earn promotion up to the Premier League. The jump was too big for most at Turf Moor, including near enough all of their new signings.",

      "38) Armel Bella-Kotchap (Southampton)\nThe young German impressed us early on after making the move from Vfl Bochum. After a strong start, the wheels fell off the Southampton bus and they were relegated. That early promise was premature.",

      "37) Georginio Rutter (Leeds)\nHis Championship form was excellent but not enough to get Leeds promoted. His signing in January 2023 was a big mistake in their bid to stay up. Brighton signed the Frenchman last summer and he is doing pretty well down south.",
      "",
      "36) Marc Roca (Leeds)\nStruggled whenever he didn’t have Tyler Adams next to him and could not adapt to the physicality of Our League. Roca is decent enough on the ball and probably did just about enough to justify the £8m Leeds paid to sign him.",

      "",
      "17) Kevin Schade (Brentford)\nBrentford paid around £20m to sign the 23-year-old from Freiburg and after a difficult spell with injuries, Schade has kicked on. He recorded 11 goals and two assists in the Premier League last term.",

      "Awoniyi proved me wrong, scoring a very respectable 10 in 27. Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",

      "6) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nIt’s early days, but Marmoush looks like a very special player.",
      "",
      "5) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta cost close to £10m in January 2022 and took a while to get going, but when he did, bloody hell, he has been difficult to stop.",
      "He is loving life under Oliver Glasner, finishing the 23/24 season with 16 league goals after scoring two in his first 19 appearances in 22/23 and eight in 77 in total. He then bagged 14 in 24/25 and helped Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "4) Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool)\nLike Thiago, Konate does have his injury troubles. Nevertheless, when he is fit Konate forms a terrific partnership with Virgil van Dijk. £36m = bargain.",
      "",
      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City)\nBig, big money for Gvardiol (£77m) but he will be worth it in the long run.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nCity should do business with Dortmund more often. Akanji has been excellent, Ilkay Gundogan’s £21m move in 2016 turned out to be one of the best signings in the club’s history, and Haaland has been…ridiculously impressive.",
      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",
      "He now has one of the biggest contracts in world football after City tied him down for 115 months. Cheeky.",

      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nThe Wirtz deal alone would be enough to propel Liverpool to top spot at this time, without having to even remember the Jeremie Frimpong deal. Unlikely they’ve concluded their spending, either."

      "And, with Ruben Amorim and United on the hunt for attacking upgrades after a thoroughly disappointing season in his absence, Sancho is wanted by a number of clubs who believe the Red Devils will want or even need to sell the England winger.",

      "In 2017, the former Watford junior left Manchester City and signed for German Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund and played more than 100 league games there before returning to Manchester with the Red Devils in 2021.",
      "United loaned Sancho out twice under Ten Hag. His 2024 calendar year was split between a return to Dortmund and the start of his stint with Chelsea.",
      "Sancho’s England career has stalled since he joined United and was clearly frustrated when Ten Hag dropped him and went public with his criticisms of the winger’s performance in training. Sancho was repeatedly left out of squads and, eventually, sent into exile.",
      "Juventus will take Sancho’s previous adaptation to new surroundings into account if they pursue their interest in the 25-year-old.",
      "Sancho was one of Dortmund’s leading lights at times in his initial four seasons in the Bundesliga, scoring 50 goals in 137 appearances in all competitions for the North Rhine-Westphalia side including two in their DFB-Pokal final win against RB Leipzig in 2021.",
      "There were eight English players in Serie A last season including former Newcastle United defender Lloyd Kelly at Juventus, where he has now signed permanently.",

      "According to reports, one Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the Premier League giants for Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "Manchester United could be under threat from the same European giant for two of their players, as they are ‘making an attempt’ to land a second forward.",
      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for modern players but transfer decisions are now being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",

      "Florian Wirtz has become the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin – here’s a rundown of the top 20.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £100m/€116m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "7) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "8) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "9) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "10) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "11) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "12) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "13) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "14) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "15) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "16) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "17) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "18) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "19) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways.",
      "",
      "20) James Rodriguez – £38.5m/€45m (Porto to Monaco, May 2013)\nLong before a Galactico future could be considered, Rodriguez was moving to newly-minted Monaco as the more expensive part of a double transfer with Joao Moutinho. The Colombian scored nine goals and assisted 13 in his only Ligue Un season."

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood. They will also make a few pennies on Amdouni after a decent loan spell with Benfica.

      "There is a genuine case to say Fernandez is legitimately the best of those Chelsea signings, which reflects well on no-one. But Todd Boehly has continued that proud tradition of general waste, with £100m Moises Caicedo finally approaching his best form as the other half of a potentially sensational midfield.",

      "Fulham do like to use their regular Premier League promotions, or in the case of Mitroglou imminent relegations, to open new transfer doors.

      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000.

      "The blockbuster arrival of Florian Wirtz blows the Van Dijk fee out of the water, but the good news for Liverpool is that this is a list containing more unambiguous success stories than most, and you always need an exception to prove the rule anyway. If you want further proof of Liverpool’s ability to get a record transfer just right, the player knocked out of this top five by Wirtz? Fernando Torres.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly made ‘initial contact’ with a goalkeeper who kept 18 clean sheets last season as an approach for current goalkeeper Andre Onana has been made by a European big hitter.",
      "United have seemingly given up on Onana after two seasons. In both his campaigns at Old Trafford, the former Inter Milan goalkeeper has made mistakes.",
      "In last season’s Premier League, he was at fault for three goals, and more in the Europa League.",
      "As a result, United are looking to go in a different direction, while also getting rid of Onana. According to Gianluca di Marzio, Monaco have ‘made an enquiry’ for the United keeper.",
      "It is not clear how much the Ligue 1 side would be willing to bid for Onana. However, Di Marzio states the goalkeeper who United ‘like the most’ is Atalanta’s Marco Carnesecchi.",
      "It is stated ‘initial contacts’ have been made with the goalkeeper’s agent, but not with his club, Atalanta, who it’s believed would not let Carnesecchi go without a satisfactory offer being made.",
      "The Italian kept 18 clean sheets last season – 13 in Serie A and five in the Champions League. Only three men kept clean sheets more often than he did in the Italian top flight last season.",
      "As such, it seems Carnesecchi would be a good option, and is a solid alternative to Emi Martinez, who United might struggle to sign.",
      "It’s been suggested they are willing to pay £40million for him, and that they’ve been given good signs the Argentina goalkeeper wants to join, with multiple reports suggesting he’d look favourably on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But it has recently been reported that Atletico Madrid have the best chance of landing Martinez.",
      "Indeed, United and Atletico are said to be the two sides most likely to sign the keeper, but United are ‘ringing every day’ to try to convince him as it’s suggested his ‘preference’ is to go to Atletico as he wants to play under Diego Simeone.",
      "Atleti have Champions League football on offer, and United have no European football at all.",
      "That could similarly hurt them in pursuit of Carnesecchi, given he played in nine games of the elite European competition last season, and he’d play in it again next season if he were to remain with Atalanta.",
      "However, it’s unclear what the response has been from his agent to the approach from United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has made a decision on his “favourite” option to replace one of his current starters.",

      "He has been given more than enough chances over the past couple of season, and United now want to go in another direction.",

      "There is said to be a fear at the Metropolitano about losing Jan Oblak, given the goalkeeper – who has played 494 times for Atletico – is the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League.",

      "Atletico have the pull of Champions League football, while United will not play any European football at all next season, so there is certainly good reason for Martinez to want to move to the Spanish side and not the Red Devils.",

      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was the subject of a bid by Manchester United; he is intrigued by a move to Spurs now that Thomas Frank is head coach; the forward is valued in excess of £60m by Brentford and they are willing to listen to offers",

      "Manchester United are relaxed about their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo despite being aware of Tottenham's interest in the Brentford forward.",
      "United are expected to go back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected. It remains to be seen whether Tottenham will follow up their initial talks or move on to Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo, who effectively has two years left on his deal, at more than £60m and are willing to listen to offers.",
      "United have other targets in Mbeumo's position, including Semenyo, and have their own values in mind for both players.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Mbeumo can also create something from nothing. According to expected goals (xG), he scored nearly eight goals more than the quality of chances presented to him last season - more than any other player in the Premier League.",
