      "The Man Utd caretaker didn't hold back in his assessment(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher slammed his Manchester United flops for being soft after watching them crash out of the FA Cup to Brighton. Fletcher's short spell as interim boss finished with a whimper as United went down 2-1 at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Brajan Gruda and Danny Welbeck were enough to send Brighton into the fourth round, despite a late strike from Benjamin Sesko. And United's misery was complete when substitute Shea Lacey was sent off for his second bookable offence in the closing stages.",
      "United were booed off and Fletcher accused his side of being fragile. He said: \"We started OK, but didn't keep the tempo. Our passing was quite slow. We didn't move the ball with tempo. We created chances, but going two nil down was difficult.",
      "\"The players are fragile. They need to build themselves up and respond. Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football, but when you don't have it, you have to dig deep.",
      "\"They have to come together. It's only the players that can do something about it. They have to find a way to win. It's about hard work, attitude and application.\"",
      "Fletcher, who will now be replaced by another interim boss until the end of the season, reckons home fans were right to jeer United. He added: \"Someone will come in and lead them. This side is still good enough to achieve something this season. I've not had any discussions beyond this game. Things will unfold in the coming days.",
      "\"The fans have every right to air their grievances. They are right to do that. I'm sure if the players show the right reaction the fans will get behind them again. There is still a to play for in the league this season.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher has failed to win either of his games in charge(Image: )",
      "Match winner Welbeck said: \"It's massive. To come here in the FA Cup - whether it's FA Cup or Premier League, it's always a massive occasion - it's one that we're delighted with, to get into the next round.\"",

      "For 44 years United had managed to at least progress in one round across the two tournaments, but their defeat at the hands of the Seagulls compounds the misery that began when they were humiliated at Grimsby Town.",
      "The dismal campaign from the Red Devils meant that the FA Cup was their only realistic hope of claiming any silverware this season, but those ambitions are now over. Danny Welbeck's strike against his former club ultimately proved to be the match winner for Brighton.",
      "United were second best for long periods on Sunday afternoon and, despite Benjamin Sesko giving them late hope, they couldn't complete a comeback. Earlier this season they had looked to rescue themselves at Blundell Park when, trailing 2-0, they scored twice late on.",
      "On that occasion though they would be beaten on penalties in an epic shootout that saw the League Two side emerge victorious 12-11. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both missing from 12 yards that evening.",
      "In the Premier League the troubled outfit, who remain without a manager after sacking Ruben Amorim, are 17 points off leaders Arsenal, but are still in the hunt for the Champions League places. Their dire campaign last time out means there is no European football.",
      "Diogo Dalot missed chances in the first-half and the Portuguese defender claimed they deserved to win the game, but ultimately have been left licking their wounds as he bemoaned the late red card to Shea Lacey.",

      "There were no shocks at Old Trafford, where Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup. And the fact this defeat came as no surprise, is a damning reflection of how low this once great club has now sunk.",
      "For the first time since World War II, United's chances of winning silverware are over in the second week of January. Unless they go on and win the title. But there's more chance of hell freezing over than this happening.",
      "And heaven help whoever agrees to take interim charge ahead of next weekend's Manchester derby. Because call me stupid, but whoever manages United isn't the problem. It's the players who are nowhere near good enough.",
      "Goals from Brajan Gruda and Danny Welbeck were enough to send Brighton into the fourth round, despite a late strike from Benjamin Sesko. It was Brighton's first ever win over United in the competition, but their fourth from the last five trips to Old Trafford.",
      "And if this proves to be Darren Fletcher's second and final game as caretaker boss, it will leave a long and bitter taste in the mouth of the former midfield great. Because some people will remember him as the bloke who managed United when they crashed out of the third round for just the third time in the last 41 ties.",
      "Fletcher had made three changes, the most significant one being the return of Kobbie Mainoo for just his second start of the season. Brighton boss Fabien Hurzeler, meanwhile, made six changes, including naming former United striker Welbeck as skipper.",
      "Diogo Dalot should have put United ahead inside two minutes following a superb pass from Matheus Cunha, but with just Jason Steele to beat, he failed to. Steele then had to charge from his goal to clear his lines just ahead of Sesko. And moments later Steele produced another fine save to keep out a low drive from Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Co were beaten 2-1 by Brighton at Old Trafford(Image: Peter Powell/AFP)",
      "United had made a bright start, but it counted for zilch when Brighton took the lead on 12 minutes. Welbeck's cross found Georginio Rutter, and when his header was blocked on the line by Lisandro Martinez, Gruda was on hand to smash the loose ball into the back of the net.",
      "A howler from Senne Lammens gifted Welbeck the chance to make it 2-0, but couldn't punish his former club. Time would tell if Welbeck's miss would prove costly.",
      "Joel Veltman lashed a shot wide, while Welbeck struck one into the side netting. United were having their heads pecked by a bunch of Seagulls, and home supporters were getting restless long before half time.",
      "All the hosts could muster were two efforts just off target from Fernandes and Cunha. Where was the inspiration coming from?",
      "Fletcher came out for the second half clapping his hands and urging supporters to get behind his side. But his players gave them nothing to cheer whatsoever.",
      "Fletcher's most famous manager gambled to win games. And Fletcher threw on Joshua Zirkzee and Shea Lacey.",
      "But within moments Welbeck had escaped Lenny Yoro to lash an unstoppable effort into the top corner - leaving United dead and buried. And just to put a tin lid on things, teenager Lacey was sent off for two bookings, to see United finish with 10 men.",

      "Luis Enrique has responded to PSG exit talk after Manchester United links(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique has dismissed reports of turning down a new contract as \"fake news\" following Manchester United links. The Spanish tactician was mooted as a possible target to replace Ruben Amorim after he was sacked from his Old Trafford post.",
      "Reports sparked a frenzy this week when the former Barcelona head coach was said to have refused a new contract at the Champions League holders. The 55-year-old has over 12 months remaining on his current deal at the French giants, however it was claimed that he felt he had achieved all he can in the capital after a glut of silverware during his three-year spell so far.",
      "Oliver Glasner, Eddie Howe and Thomas Tuchel have been credited as potential candidates to become the next permanent manager in the Old Trafford hotseat.",
      "Speculation regarding a potential move for Enrique have intensifed since reports that an extension has been turned down.",
      "However, ahead of PSG's derby with Paris FC in the Coupe de France, the 55-year-old rubbished the reports insisting that they won't destabilise the squad.",
      "He said: \"These are rumours that always circulate at PSG.",
      "\"We are used to them, they are private matters and will remain so. There is a lot of 'fake news' and they will not destabilise either the players or the team.",
      "\"It's normal to have talks, but they remain private. We know what we want, and that's the most important thing. We are calm and relaxed.\"",
      "Reports have suggested Luis Enrique is looking for a new challenge and is set to turn down fresh talks.(Image: FIFA via Getty Images)",

      "The Mirror understands that the club are weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",

      "\"But if I prepare myself and the opportunity comes for me one day, I know I'll be ready. If it doesn't and it means staying as the under-18s coach, I'll be more than comfortable with that as I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",

      "Brighton kept up their stunning record at Old Trafford(Image: )",
      "Brighton secured another win at Old Trafford to ensure Manchester United's week went from bad to worse as their FA Cup hopes were ended for another year.",
      "In what is likely to be Darren Fletcher's swansong as caretaker boss he saw his side undone by the visiting Seagulls with Brajan Gruda's first-half strike setting them on their way before Danny Welbeck enjoyed another moment back at the place he once called home.",
      "It represents a new low for United, who have been dumped out of both domestic cups at the first hurdle for the first time in 44 years. Their loss to Brighton following the humiliating loss to Grimsby Town earlier this season.",
      "After Diogo Dalot, who was sent clear, had seen his early effort saved by Jason Steele Brighton made them pay as Gruda was able to hammer home. Georginio Rutter saw his header cleared off the line by Lisandro Martinez, but his German team-mate was on hand to convert past four United defenders from six yards in front of the Stretford End.",
      "The home side became increasingly frustrated and a difficult task was made even worse when Welbeck produced a stunning finish to double the Brighton lead. He allowed the ball to run across him before firing a left-footed striker into the top corner.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, fresh from his brace in midweek, headed home with five minutes left to set up a grandstand finish. But minutes later and teenager Shea Lacey was shown a second yellow for throwing the ball away and United's ten men couldn't rally to find an equaliser.",
      "Here's five talking points from Sunday's clash",
      "You sack your head coach on Monday, have to fightback to claim a point at a team in the relegation zone in midweek and then see another trophy hope ended in your own back yard. This week on the red side of Manchester has been a constant source of discussion, but those associated with the club won't remember it too fondly.",
      "It will be several months before they can talk about their next new era so the interim manager who comes in, likely this week, will be picking up some seriously broken pieces. The FA Cup, as well as hopes of a top four finish, were the two things the club have been holding onto this term, but it will be all eggs in the league from here on in.",
      "Without having time to delve into the archives, I doubt too many away teams will have won four times on the trot at Old Trafford, but that is what the Seagulls pulled off with another win. Safe to say their week in Manchester has been a positive one. Last season Fabian Hurzeler became the third Brighton boss in a row to win at Old Trafford, following in the footsteps of Graham Potter and Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Danny Welbeck scored his fifth goal for Brighton against Man Utd(Image: )",
      "They've now added an FA Cup scalp to their three successive victories on the red side of Manchester that they've pulled off in recent years. On every occasion they were more than good value for their victory. They must be looking forward to their next trip in May 24.",
      "In their victory last term Welbeck was on target and, as he has been several times in the past, the former United man was against scoring at Old Trafford for the visiting team. His emphatic finish put Brighton in total control - and he didn't shy away from celebrating.",
      "It seemed like he was firmly seen as a squad player under Amorim, even if the Portuguese coach did claim he was the \"future of the club\". You wouldn't think he felt that way given the lack of minutes he handed the academy star. Casemiro was regularly starting ahead of him, but maybe that's about to change.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo struggled to make an impact as he was handed a rare start(Image: )",
      "The Brazilian hasn't been tearing up trees and Fletcher took the opportunity to make the change that so many United fans have been calling for. Mainoo was in from the start and whilst the next man in charge may choose to keep him there, he by no means pressed his case to be a guaranteed starter and was hauled off on the hour mark.",
      "Time will tell on this one. When he was first named as caretaker the talk was of him taking charge of Burnley, then it turned into this weekend. United's hierarchy look like their close to landing an interim until the end of the season - be that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick.",
      "Fletcher is understood to have impressed those above him with how he's conducted himself and prepared the team. His results clear less impressive. It doesn't look like the club have seen enough to warrant handing him the reigns until season's end with one of his former team-mates set to come in.",
      "Frustration among the Man Utd fans is on the rise(Image: )",
      "It only look ten minutes for the first anti-Sir Jim Ratcliffe chant from the Stretford End. As well as that there were two anti-Glazers chants as the frustration with the club's hierarchy and their decision making continues to mount. The American owners had tried to fade into the background by selling a share to the Ineos boss and giving him control of the football side.",
      "Now, after several unpopular decisions off the pitch, and continued failings on it and in the dugout, it seems as if Ratcliffe and the Glazers are being seen as one and the same. It had been seen as the chance to start a fresh, even though the Americans retain overall control, but any good feeling that may have existed is nearly all but gone.",

      "Now, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has emerged as a potential candidate to take over from interim boss Darren Fletcher as caretaker manager, with United CEO Omar Berrada and Director of Football Jason Wilcox meeting with the former player and manager this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ team-mates reportedly fear he has had enough of the turmoil at United and will move on in the summer after six years with the club. The United captain, 31, was strongly linked with an exit last summer after a reported £100m offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes later admitted in November he was left feeling \"hurt\" and \"sad\" that United chiefs were willing to sell him, and that it was compatriot Amorim who persuaded him to stay in Manchester. But, six months on and with Amorim now gone, The Sun claim his team-mates are led to believe he will finally seal a transfer away in the next few months.",
      "A source is reported to have said: “Some of the squad think Bruno has had enough and, to be honest, they don’t blame him. He always gives 100 per cent and has been the club’s best player since he joined.",
      "“But they think that he feels let down under the new ownership model and Amorim leaving has not helped. He isn’t a likely candidate for a big-money move to Saudi because he’s a football purist.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future may lie elsewhere(Image: Getty Images)",

      "United could reportedly miss out on signing Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi after sacking Amorim. Tuttosport reported that Senesi, who is out of contract in the summer, received a call from United in December over a potential move at the end of the season.",
      "The Argentine centre-back, 28, is not expected to sign a new deal, which would have put United in the running to sign him on a bargain free transfer. But the report claims United are \"busy with other matters\" after Amorim’s dismissal.",

He has seven goals to his name from just 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig, form has seen a number of top clubs cast their eye on him, including both Arsenal and United.",
      "But they and others keeping close tabs on Diomande could be left disappointed after the youngster appeared to admit that he wants to play for Liverpool at some point in his career. Speaking in a TikTok live stream, Diomande said: “Yes I do, I want to play at Anfield and I want to play for Liverpool. I’m a big fan of Liverpool.",
      "“I’m a big fan of Liverpool because my father’s dream is to see me play at Anfield. So that’s my dream. You know, to fulfil my father’s dream is a dream for me too.”",
      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are among the other clubs who are said to be mulling over a future move for Diomande. Leipzig, for their part, have made their intentions to keep him clear. As per The Athletic, they see the teenager as essential to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League and will not sell unless they receive an offer in the region of €100million (£87m).",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a rock to lean on in wife Silje(Image: 2020 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Former Manchester United striker and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is one of the favourites to take over at Old Trafford. The club have been on the hunt for a new manager after sacking Ruben Amorim last week.",
      "Darren Fletcher took charge of Wednesday's draw at Burnley, but it's increasingly likely that Solskjaer will make his return to the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "Solskjaer has been with his wife Silje since 1992. Silje was a professional footballer in her own right and the couple even trained together in Norway. Solskjaer has spoken about his relationship on several occasions.",
      "He once said: \"Silje was a very good football player. We often trained together when we were younger. Back in Clausenengen, we had a kids’ football training group in the morning that I really was too old to go.\"",
      "The couple have been rock-solid for decades and were only briefly apart during Solskjaer's military service. They quickly reunited and married in Florida in 2004.",
      "Upon being relieved of his duties at United in November 2021, the ex-forward revealed how paramount his relationship with Sije, and his three children, was as he navigated being away from them during the Covid-19 pandemic while in charge of United.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer waves from the stand alongside wife Silje and son Elijah in 2019(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I’ll spend some time with my family,\" he said. \"That’s been probably the most difficult part, through the pandemic. With Norway being open and here being closed, my family moved back to Norway. And the young one, he loves it back there, so we’ve lived apart. So, I’ll spend some time with them.\"",
      "Ole and Silje had their first child, Noah, in June 2000. Three years later they welcomed daughter Karna, while youngest son Elijah was born in 2008. All three children have followed their parents into the beautiful game.",
      "Noah began his football career in the Clausenengen youth teams. The striker, now 25, plies his trade for Stjørdals-Blink in Norway.",
      "Karna, now 22, plays as a forward for AaFK Fortuna. Elijah had also made in-roads with a football career, beginning his journey in United's academy.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer poses with his sons Noah Solskjaer (L) and Elijah Solskjaer (Image: 2019 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick has also been linked with a return to United since Amorim's sacking, perhaps linking up with Solskjaer in tandem. The former midfielder called time on his playing career at the end of the 2017/18 season and went on to work with Jose Mourinho at United before being retained by Solskjaer.",
      "Carrick revealed that he was a pillar of help for Solskjaer during their time as a management team. Speaking on his duties, he said: \"I support the manager basically.",
      "\"I get in about 8.15am to help plan the session for that day and plan ahead for the next game. Whatever the manager needs I'm there to support him.\" The former Middlesbrough boss' experience could now make him a port of call once again for Solskjaer.",
      "Mike Phelan, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick in the dugout for United back in 2019(Image: 2019 Robin Jones)",
      "Sir Alex may have quit United as manager in 2013 but he still casts a looming shadow over all things United to this day. Having brought Solskjaer to the club, Sir Alex will no doubt be a support option for the man once known as the 'Baby Faced Assassin'.",
      "The legendary United boss even once praised Solskjaer's knack for bringing youth players into the first team, one of Ferguson's prime assets during his time in the dugout.",
      "In early 2021, Ferguson told the BBC: \"If you don't get results, there's questions to be asked. He is getting the results, he really has done very well.",
      "\"And what is really important for this club is to introduce young people, and he's given young players a chance. The young guys, if they are good enough, play them. Never a problem at this club.\"",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer during the Norwegian's reign as Manchester United boss(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "Phelan left United in 2022 and was last employed as Plymouth Argyle's assistant boss. Phelan joined Solskjaer as his No. 2 during the latter's first spell as United manager.",
      "The 63-year-old was singled out for praise by Solskjaer, highlighting just how vital Sir Alex's former assistant was to the Norwegian. Phelan will no doubt be a confidant should Solskjaer need it, if he does indeed return to United.",
      "\"Mick's absolutely brilliant,\" Solskjaer said in 2019. \"With his experience, his knowledge and personality around the place. Not just for the players and coaches, but the rest of the staff as well. Mick's tough but he's kind. He's got everything I would want in an assistant.\"",

      "Man Utd currently sit seventh in the Premier League(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United chiefs STILL want a place in the Champions League despite Ruben Amorim’s departure earlier this week. The Red Devils decided to sack the Portuguese coach on Monday, bringing his underwhelming 14-month reign at Old Trafford to an end.",
      "United failed to qualify for any form of European football last season under Amorim’s watch, but they raised expectations with a huge summer transfer outlay, with their attack undergoing a rigorous £200million transformation. United currently sit seventh in the Premier League, albeit three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool - and club chiefs have underlined that they want a place in the Champions League next season, with or without Amorim.",
      "A source told The Sun said: “[Jason] Wilcox (director of football) has spoken with the players in the wake of Amorim’s departure. He’s explained that the season has had some disappointments so far, but urged the players to come together and try and sustain some good form in the second half of the season.",
      "“Qualifying for the Champions League is the target and it’s attainable. That was the message.”",
      "Wilcox’s message comes after CEO Omar Berrada claimed that it was United’s target to win the Premier League within the next three years. Speaking in the summer, the former Manchester City chief said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "United’s aim for Premier League glory appears to be remote as it stands, particularly with a lack of manager. Darren Fletcher is currently in caretaker charge at Old Trafford, albeit talks are ongoing with former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer regarding a second interim stint.",
      "Jason Wilcox has reportedly spoken to the United squad following Ruben Amorim's axe(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former coach Amorim’s departure appeared to centre around a breakdown in relationship with Wilcox. It is suggested that the latter compared his own role to that of a manager, something that infuriated the Portuguese tactician and led to his bizarre rant in the aftermath of the draw against Leeds.",

      "Senesi, whose contract expires in the summer, reportedly 'received a call' from United in December, as he plans to depart from the Cherries at the end of the season, Tuttosport reports. The Argentine has informed the Bournemouth board that he has no intention of extending his current deal.",
      "With 88 Premier League appearances under his belt since joining the Cherries from Feyenoord in 2022, he could prove to be a cost-effective acquisition for any club on a free transfer. United are among those interested, having reached out to the 28 year old's representatives last month.",
      "However, it's suggested that United are currently preoccupied with other issues following Amorim's sacking. The Reds confirmed in a statement on Monday that the Portuguese head coach had been let go after the 1-1 draw against Leeds United.",

      "And just days after seeing his contract ripped up, Amorim has decided to return to Portugal. CNN Portugal shared images of the 40-year-old touching down in his homeland on Saturday evening alongside his son.",
      "Amorim was mobbed by reporters but chose not to answer any of their questions before getting into a car. It is not the first time that Amorim has been seen since seeing his spell with United brutally ended.",
      "He was also pictured leaving his Cheshire home on Monday alongside wife Maria Joao Diogo. Amorim’s return to Portugal coincides with the former Sporting Lisbon boss being tipped for a managerial return in his home country.",
      "Asked by Hard Rock Bet where he could go next, United icon Gary Pallister said: “I don’t know. He’s a young man and this may take time to get over. He certainly looked like a manager under immense pressure.”",
      "He added: “I don’t know where Ruben ends up next. He might go back to Portugal. I’m sure someone from Portugal would want him after the job he did over there with Sporting. He has got time to sit and think about it. I’m sure there will be some scar tissue from this. It’s been a tough ride.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck is due to return to Old Trafford with Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday. The England international has been linked with a shock United return in the January transfer window after impressing on the south coast but there will be some who believe the Red Devils were wrong to let him leave to begin with.",
      "A fan favourite after coming through the academy as a local lad, Welbeck scored on his Premier League debut for United as a teenager. After cutting his teeth during a couple of loan spells, he was brought firmly into the first-team set-up under Sir Alex Ferguson and scored nine league goals in 25 outings during David Moyes' one season in charge.",
      "The arrival of Louis van Gaal in the summer of 2014 ushered in a new era for the club, with squad members needing to prove their worth to the Dutch manager. Within a few weeks, though, Welbeck had all the information he needed to decide his future lay elsewhere.",
      "Welbeck had been left frustrated during Moyes' tenure, often being shunted out to the left wing. It was clear he would rather have played as a central striker, but - if he was to fill that role under Van Gaal - he wouldn't be doing so as the manager's first choice.",
      "He didn't start any of United's first three league matches under the new boss, sitting out the defeat to Swansea and coming off the bench in draws with Sunderland and Burnley. In August 2014, reports emerged that Van Gaal had told Welbeck he could leave, though the manager remained cagey on the matter.",
      "“I know what I said to Danny and Danny knows exactly what I said to him,” Van Gaal said at the time. “I assume that Danny Welbeck is not saying anything about our conversation and also in that conversation was [the assistant manager] Ryan Giggs and he doesn’t say [anything] either, and that is the way it should be.”",
      "As the transfer deadline neared, though, a fresh issue emerged for Welbeck. United swooped for Radamel Falcao, with the striker joining on a season-long loan from Monaco.",
      "It was clear the Colombian wasn't arriving as a fourth-choice striker behind Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Welbeck. The latter decided the time was right to move, joining Arsenal for £16million with barely any time to spare before the window shut.",
      "Welbeck during his first season at Arsenal(Image: PA)",
      "“It’s exciting times for me,\" Welbeck said after moving to North London. \"It’s great to be a part of this club and it’s a team that I’ve always watched in the Premier League. I’ve envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting.\"",
      "By the time Welbeck faced his old employers for the first time in November 2014, he had scored more goals than any of the strikers who stayed at Old Trafford. Even so, Van Gaal defended the sale in a pre-match press conference.",
      "\"I think that a player who is playing mostly fixed in the team, he develops and always will,” Van Gaal said. “He takes all the benefit from playing every week.",
      "\"That was a question mark with Manchester United. It's good to see he's doing what I thought. He could have also played for Manchester United. But we have decided that he could go and he has taken the benefit of it.\"",
      "However, Van Gaal's compatriot and Sir Alex Ferguson's former assistant Rene Meulensteen believed Ferguson would have never allowed Welbeck to leave. \"You look back through the history of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and we were always keen on bringing young players through and giving them a chance,\" said Meulensteen.",
      "The striker has thrived at Brighton(Image: Jed Leicester/Shutterstock)",
      "Welbeck's time at Arsenal was beset by injuries which limited him to just 126 appearances in five years but he still scored some memorable goals including a last-gasp winner against Leicester in the 2015/16 season which briefly gave the Gunners hope of a title win.",
      "A move to Watford in 2019 wasn't the most fruitful, with the Hornets suffering relegation from the Premier League and allowing him to join Brighton after just one season at Vicarage Road. He has discovered some of the best form of his career on the south coast, though, and last season marked the first time he has scored double figures in a single Premier League campaign.",
      "He already has eight goals this season at a rate of one every 140 minutes in the league, prompting speculation over a United return and even an England recall for the first time since 2018. There will still be some United fans left wondering what might have been had things been different for him under Van Gaal.",

The ex-winger found himself on the wrong end of one of Sir Alex Ferguson's notorious rants, with things getting so dire that he was made to reside in club-provided housing.",
      "During his eight-year stint at Old Trafford, Sharpe won three Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy, and several domestic cups. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for the forward in Manchester as he grappled with inconsistent form and injuries throughout his tenure at the club.",
      "A notable incident occurred when Sharpe sought Fergie's approval to move in with his long-term girlfriend after turning 18. Speaking on the Sacked in the Morning podcast, the 54-year-old reflected on the extent of control the legendary manager wielded in Manchester and how it impacted his personal life.",
      "Sharpe said: \"From top to bottom, he ran the club. He said he'd allow it [moving in with his girlfriend] and asked if we were getting married. We'd been going out since I was 12, and that was the plan.",
      "\"But he said if my form suffered, I'd be going to go back into digs. I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, that's not a problem.' And then my form started to suffer. At Anfield, of all places, he decided to try to change our formation to match up with Liverpool and play three at the back and five in midfield.",
      "\"Me and Ryan Giggs were running around in circles not knowing who to mark. The game was passing us by. At half-time, he said, in not so many words, 'You are absolutely useless.'\"",
      "However, Sharpe revealed that the tirade didn't stop there as he added: \"[Ferguson said] 'Tomorrow, you're going to sell your house, sell your dog, sell your car. You send your girlfriend back to Birmingham, you're back in digs.'",
      "Lee Sharpe ended up on the wrong side of Fergie(Image: David Davies/Mark Leech Sports Photography/Getty Images)",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't play great, came off with about 20 minutes to go, went home, told my girlfriend she had to go home. That was the end of that. Then every week he would come up to me in training and ask, 'Are you married yet?' I'm like, 'Married? You sent my girlfriend home!\"",
      "Despite this romantic hiccup, Sharpe eventually managed to win Ferguson's approval, making 261 appearances for the Red Devils and scoring 36 goals, while providing 30 assists.",
      "After his eight-year stint at United, Sharpe had spells at Leeds United, Bradford City and Bradford before retiring in 2004 with 10 major honours to his name.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was wanted by Saudi Arabia side Al Hilal last summer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future at Manchester United continues to be a hot topic, with reports claiming his teammates are \"concerned he may leave\" the club when the season ends. The Sun has reported that Fernandes' colleagues at Old Trafford fear United's captain and star playmaker has grown tired of the \"shambles\" at the club.",
      "The report suggests Fernandes could look for a fresh challenge after the World Cup this summer. Last summer, Fernandes was linked with a switch to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, with a £100million transfer fee reportedly on offer.",
      "However, he remained at the club, despite the prospect of tripling his wages. A source told The Sun that \"some of the squad think Bruno has had enough and, to be honest, they don't blame him. He always gives 100% and has been the club's best player since he joined.\"",
      "Fernandes, whose contract at Old Trafford runs until 2027 with an option for another year, addressed a potential summer departure in an interview with Canal+. \"I decided not to go [to Saudi Arabia], not only for family reasons but because I genuinely liked the club,\" he said.",
      "\"From the club I felt; 'If you go it's not that bad for us'. It hurts me a bit. More than hurting, it makes me sad, I'm a player who has nothing to point to, I'm always available, I always give the best of me.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes was close to a move away from Manchester United in the summer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He continued: \"The club wanted me to go [away]. I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "In October, Fernandes revealed to journalists that he had discussed his transfer with United's top brass. He stated: \"I had conversations with Al-Hilal, everyone is aware of that - from Europe I had some people talking to me but we never got into the place where we would have offers on the table or not.",
      "\"I spoke with both [director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada]. I think we were in Malaysia, that was when everything started. I told Omar; 'Look, this is what is on the table, I know the club might be looking at this in a way and I will be looking at it differently - so I just want to know your perspective'.",
      "\"Jason, like Omar, said; 'We won't say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us because obviously it's massive money'. I spoke with the manager and he said to me; 'No, we want more players to help you to become a better team so we don't want you to go - if we bring some people and then we lose you - we're still going to lose together'.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher reckons he's ready to become the full-time Manchester United boss should the opportunity arise. The former midfielder has been in caretaker charge of the Red Devils since Ruben Amorim’s sacking earlier this month.",
      "He secured a 2-2 draw with Burnley in his opening game and is set to oversee Sunday’s FA Cup third round clash with Brighton. That game could represent Fletcher’s final match, with United chiefs holding talks with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer regarding a second spell as interim on Saturday.",
      "Despite that, an extended stay for Fletcher has still not been ruled out. And the Scot has said that he feels capable of doing the job should he be offered it. \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future,\" said Fletcher. “I've enjoyed it, I really have. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I think I'm quite well prepared. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future. It was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing.",
      "\"It's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day and I know I'll be ready to do it.",
      "\"But if it doesn't, I'll be more than comfortable with that. If it means I remain as the under-18s coach, I'm really happy.\"",

      "The former Liverpool star was sent off in the first half(Image: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)",
      "Jonjo Shelvey once dubbed the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson a \"Scottish c***\" after blaming him for his red card. But the iconic manager's laid-back reaction left the England star stunned.",
      "The former midfielder arrived at Liverpool in 2010 and served under Roy Hodgson and Sir Kenny Dalglish before Brendan Rodgers took control. Shelvey featured in the opening clash against Manchester United during the 2012/13 campaign but saw red in the first half following a tackle on Jonny Evans.",
      "United emerged 2-1 winners that day, courtesy of strikes from Rafael and Robin van Persie, yet the spotlight remained firmly on Shelvey's reaction to his dismissal. Speaking on the Undr the Cosh podcast, the 33-year-old revealed precisely what he said to Fergie whilst departing the Anfield turf in fury.",
      "Shelvey said: \"I still think it was a good tackle to this day. My dad's got a picture up in his little flat of me coming in and Jonny Evans, his feet are like two-footing [into the tackle] but I'm sort of like scissor [kicking].",
      "\"I think the ref was Mark Halsey, and he sends me off, but as I get up, I can see Fergie in the fourth official's ear. I'm thinking, 'This is only going one way.'",
      "\"The don said, 'Send him off.' And it was such a huge game, Liverpool, Man United. As I'm walking off, I just lost it and said, 'It's your fault I got sent off you, Scottish c***.'\"",
      "Despite this obvious display of frustration and disrespect, Ferguson didn't hold a grudge and actually commended his rival for his passionate nature.",
      "Shelvey added: \"But then I see him after the game and I just said, 'Look, I apologise for the way I spoke to you, it was wrong of me.' He said, 'No, don't worry about it, I like it.'",
      "Jonjo Shelvey was taken aback by Fergie's response(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "\"And then that was it, and then I played against his teams again after that and got on well with him. I think it just got blown out of proportion because of the magnitude of the game and he was spot on - just said, 'Don't worry about it.'\"",
      "Shelvey subsequently issued an apology on social media for his response to the dismissal, though he couldn't resist another subtle swipe at Fergie in the process. Posting on X, he said: \"I apologise to the fans for getting sent off, but no way was I pulling out of that tackle in a game of that importance. I'm sorry.",
      "\"I have also apologised to Sir Alex Ferguson. Where I come from, people don't grass people up to get someone sent off.\" United finished that season with the Premier League trophy, while Shelvey had to settle for a seventh-place finish with Liverpool.",

      "Roy Keane has already given his views on a return to coaching amid growing links with a Manchester United comeback(Image: Stick to Football on YouTube)",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has received a growing endorsement to take over as Ruben Amorim's successor on an interim basis. However, the Irishman may have ruined any chance of a return to the club where he became an icon.",
      "United, currently led by caretaker Darren Fletcher, are hard at work seeking out a new manager following Amorim's sacking in the wake of his fiery rant at certain club figures. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is believed to be high in the pecking order of potential appointments, as is fellow United alumnus Michael Carrick.",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt recently backed their former captain to take over the reins for the rest of the season. Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Butt endorsed the experiment and insisted Keane has \"changed unbelievably in the last 10 years.\"",
      "Gary Pallister acknowledged Keane's long hiatus from management but nonetheless backed his old colleague to \"shake it up\" back at United. At the very least, he said the Irishman would \"certainly command respect,\" which can often be half the battle in getting performances out of players.",
      "And Bryan Robson has also tipped Keane, 54, to make his way back into management following a long time away. Speaking in October, the United legend tipped his countryman to partner with former team-mate John O'Shea in leading the Republic of Ireland.",
      "However, Keane - who hasn't managed a club since leaving Ipswich Town in 2011 - may have already ruined his stock at Old Trafford. That's after questioning Sir Alex Ferguson's overarching influence at the club, suggesting the Scot keeps \"hanging on like a bad smell.\"",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane had a tempestuous relationship that has soured since the latter's retirement(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Then again, there's a chance Ratcliffe may in fact take to Keane's rebellious nature when it comes to Ferguson. That's after the British billionaire and minority owner cut down Ferguson's duties at Old Trafford and ended his £2.16million-a-year global ambassador role.",
      "After more than a decade away from coaching, Keane has said he'd be open to a touchline return. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast in 2023, he said: \"I’d like to go back in, yeah... I think it’s just the challenge of getting back in.",
      "\"I’ve been out of management for a number of years now, but I’m still agitated every Saturday about not having a team. And I’ve not managed for 10 to 11 years, so it never goes away.\"",
      "While he's clearly up for entering the dugout once again, Keane, who left United under controversial circumstances in 2005, has routinely distanced himself from a United return. Not only that, but he's already had his say on whom he'd like to see replace Amorim, opting for Newcastle chief Eddie Howe.",
      "Keane's former team-mates reckon he'd be the perfect man for the job(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"I like what Howe has done, he's managed a lot of games, his teams play good football,\" he said this month. \"I know he has his critics, but I like what he's done at Newcastle, even at Bournemouth. He's managed 700, 800 games. I like his calmness - I think Man United sometimes need a bit of that.",
      "\"I like people with emotion. I'm quite an emotional person, but his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle. Getting them into the Champions League, winning a [Carabao] Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "Those comments perhaps indicate the former hard man isn't out to promote his own candidacy for the position. However, Keane isn't short of supporters for the job, as many fans want to see things shaken up with the next boss.",

      "Rising through the academy at Old Trafford, Mulryne had the ability to operate as a forward, midfielder or on the right wing - offering tactical flexibility to the squad. However, a plethora of stars, including David Beckham and Paul Scholes, meant that breaking into the first XI proved virtually impossible.",

      "United had started the game pretty well but it was Brighton who took the lead after 12 minutes. It was sloppy defending from the hosts, who were exposed down the right and failed to mark in the centre, with Brajan Gruda applying the finishing touch.",
      "Gruda turned provider in the second half, teeing up Danny Welbeck for his customary goal against his former club. Again, the defending was desperately poor.",
      "United got one back late in the game, with Benjamin Sesko heading in a Bruno Fernandes corner, but it came too late to force extra-time. Shea Lacey saw red late on for a second yellow card.",

      "Senne Lammens: One horrible moment with the ball at his feet in the first half, when he was lucky he wasn't punished. Did at least shrug it off well. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Early miss set the tone. Struggled defensively and got decisions wrong in the final third. Brighton got a lot of joy down United's right. 4",
      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Passing continues to be a major weakness and United need more from their No.6. His days are numbered. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lacking football this season and looked short of rhythm at times. Booked for a bit of a lazy challenge against Welbeck but tried to make things happen. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Tried to influence the game but short of his best. Sent in the corner for the goal and at least tries to lead by example. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled with his role on the right. Made no impact from an attacking point of view and was a weakness defensively when Ferdi Kadıoğlu went forward. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: His good run of form seems to have ended already. Had a chance to step up recently but hasn't taken it and poor today. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Again got involved and had his share of chances. Needs to time his runs better but deserves credit for his workrate and occupying defenders. 6",
      "Substitutes",
      "Shea Lacey: Some direct wing play that lifted United and created a chance for Sesko. Moment of frustration for second yellow but 18-year-old deserves sympathy and was gutted. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Didn't make much impact off the bench and another game that seemed to pass him by. 6",
      "Harry Maguire: Nuisance in the opposition box. 6",
      "Casemiro: Little time to make an impact. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Heaven, Malacia, J. Fletcher, T. Fletcher",

      "Fletcher was placed in caretaker charge after Amorim was sacked on Monday morning. He guided United to a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor on Wednesday when they produced an encouraging performance, but they regressed against Brighton in the FA Cup and were beaten 2-1 to end their hopes of winning silverware this season.",
      "The Scot will now report to Carrington on Monday, with United looking to confirm an appointment in the next few days. They face Manchester City on Saturday, and preparations for the Old Trafford derby will step up on Wednesday, with the club likely to be keen to have the new man in by the middle of the week.",
      "\"I have to report tomorrow morning to Carrington. That's all I know. So I'll find out whatever I need to find out tomorrow morning,\" said Fletcher.",
      "Asked if he had an indication of what was likely to happen, he said: \"I've had zero indication. All my energy and focus and concentration had to be on these two games and such a quick turnaround to prepare the team. I genuinely mean that. It's a massive responsibility to lead this club.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result today. But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"But ultimately it wasn't enough. So I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well. I want the players to do well. And I tell you what, it's not about me. I've had my time as a player. It's in the bank now, it was fun. Loved every minute of that. I was very lucky.",
      "\"It's all about them. But we need to help them. The club need to help them. And they need to help themselves.\"",

      "Manchester United are enduring another disastrous - and wasted - season(Image: )",
      "At some point this week, a Manchester United great will ride back into Carrington and look to rescue a season that has hit rock bottom. Surely it can't get any worse than this. Fans of nostalgia will remember Mick McCarthy's iconic answer to a press conference question along similar lines. \"It can,\" came the droll response. They are certainly fans of nostalgia around these parts and it's Manchester City and Arsenal up next.",
      "United's cup endeavours are over for another season, embarrassed by a team from the east coast and humbled by one from the south coast. This is a team all at sea. Darren Fletcher's chances of being the white knight are almost certainly over after his team were beaten by a smarter, slicker and more streetwise Brighton. Defeat in the FA Cup third round means United will play just 40 games this season and they have lost at the first hurdle in both cup competitions.",
      "This season is turning into an annus horribilis, but then so do most of them at Old Trafford these days. A trawl through the record books is difficult in the search for easy comparisons, but 1981/82 was the last time they went out of both cups after just one game. At least they were still in a title race in January 1982. In 1970/71, their chances of silverware had gone by January 5, although they did reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. The last time they played fewer than 40 games in a season came in 1914/15.",
      "Whether it is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick who lands the interim head coach job this week, they will have just 17 games to make an impact in more than four months. They are seventh in the Premier League, but could easily be in the bottom half if the games against City and Arsenal go against them.",
      "Returning to former players, both of whom have led the team before, smacks of desperation and everywhere you turn at the moment you are reminded of the past. Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes were sitting next to Sir Alex Ferguson in the directors' box on Sunday. They recently pushed the credentials of Roy Keane to take charge until the end of the season, a theory they were unlikely to float in the company of Ferguson, whose feud with Keane remains as bitter as ever.",
      "Keane himself has raised Eddie Howe as a leading candidate for the job. Maybe this director of football business isn't as simple as it sounds after all. United's politburo is certainly making it look difficult. Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are in the crosshairs and faith has long since vanished in Sir Jim Ratcliffe. There were two anti-Glazer chants and one aimed at Ratcliffe inside the first 10 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox will turn their attention to finalising an appointment until the end of the season at the start of the week. Saturday's Manchester derby looms large in the calendar and United need the bounce a new boss might provide. Solskjaer had a good record against Pep Guardiola during his three years in charge and history is about all there is to cling to at the moment.",
      "Whoever is in the dugout next week will at least have the benefit of having Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back in the team. Fletcher has been hamstrung by the absence of width in his team and as it had been at Turf Moor, that was a problem against the Seagulls.",
      "The failure of Amorim's United to take the game to the opposition, especially at Old Trafford, was a source of concern for the football hierarchy and ultimately led to his downfall. Too often, they would start games at Old Trafford passively, see the atmosphere quiet and allow the opposition a foothold.",
      "Fletcher was keen to set a different trend. Diogo Dalot should have scored inside 90 seconds, Bruno Fernandes went close from a free-kick and United set a tempo that got the Old Trafford crowd engaged.",
      "But it also produced an open game and it quickly became apparent it suited Brighton more. They worked a simple overload against Dalot to allow Danny Welbeck to cross and Georginio Rutter and Brajan Gruda couldn't believe the space they were afforded in front of goal. Rutter's header was cleared off the line by Lisandro Martinez, but Gruda rammed home the rebound.",
      "It extended a dismal run to just one clean sheet in 15 games, and whether it is a back three, four or five, United are making basic errors in defence. Senne Lammens nearly added to the rap sheet when he passed the ball straight to Welbeck. The Belgian goalkeeper's save dug himself out of trouble.",
      "United had been behind after 13 minutes in Fletcher's first game in charge and now found themselves losing after 12 minutes here. The response at Turf Moor was encouraging but the slickness of Brighton's passing and the intelligence of their pressing was too much.",
      "Welbeck is a regular tormentor of his former club, to the point that United have considered making a move for the 35-year-old under their last two permanent bosses. You can see why that temptation is there. The defending from Patrick Dorgu, Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte was woeful, but when Gruda's pass found Welbeck just after the hour mark, the left-footed finish was emphatic.",
      "United looked to have run out of inspiration, but Benjamin Sesko's late header did at least set up a grandstand finale. Shea Lacey's second booking and a red card that left the 18-year-old close to tears brought the chance to a fitting endpoint.",
      "This season isn't over yet, but it is already shaping up to be another wasted year.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has described the situation at the club as \"really difficult\" since Ruben Amorim was sacked. United sacked Amorim amid rising tensions with the board, and Darren Fletcher was promoted from the academy to take interim charge of the team.",
      "Fletcher oversaw his second game in charge against Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, but United suffered a 2-1 defeat to crash out of England's oldest cup competition at the first opportunity. United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town in August, meaning the defeat to Brighton ensures there will be no silverware won at Old Trafford this term.",
      "The defender was asked what the mood has been like since Amorim was sacked. \"Really difficult,\" he responded. \"It's always a period that you have to find ways to solve problems really quickly. We have to adapt and go again.\"",
      "\"We got back to 2-1 and the energy was up but ultimately we couldn't get over the line. I think you can see the players are fragile. You need to dig deep. The fans weren't happy at the end, they have every right to do that. I'm sure if the players show the right reaction, the fans will get behind them like they always do.\"",
      "United's defeat means they will play just 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest in Manchester United's search for a new manager on Sunday, January 11.",
      "Ruben Amorim's exit as the head coach of United was officially announced on Monday, leaving the Reds on the hunt for a head coach. Darren Fletcher took charge of Wednesday's draw at Burnley and will oversee today's FA Cup clash with Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Former United striker and boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is one of the favourites to take over at Old Trafford. Alongside Michael Carrick, the club are seeking a short-term fix until the end of the season before appointing someone om a full-time basis.",
      "A permanent appointment is expected to be announced at the end of the season, with several names linked to it. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has been labelled an early favourite, though Eddie Howe has recently been tipped to take over",
      "Paris Saint-Germain's Luis Enrique and Marseille's Roberto De Zerbi are also on their radar. No clarity on who will come in for the 2026/27 season is expected until the end of hte season.",
      "Stay here for all of the latest throughout the day, around the appointment of a new manager.",
      "Managerless Manchester United’s hopes of ending a topsy-turvy season with silverware are over after they were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton.",
      "Gruda and Welbeck put the Seagulls in total control before Benjamin Sesko's header five minutes from time breathed life into the home side, but 18-year-old home substitute Shea Lacey was sent off in the final minute.",
      "It is going from bad to worse for Manchester United as Danny Welbeck has made it 2-0 to Brighton at Old Trafford.",
      "United look to be heading out of the FA Cup at the first time of asking.",
      "Welbeck now has eight goals against United in all competitions, his joint-most against an opponent in his club career.",
      "Former Manchester United forward and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the top contender to take the temporary reins at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have been actively seeking a new caretaker boss following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim last week.",
      "Darren Fletcher oversaw Wednesday's draw against Burnley, but it appears increasingly probable that Solskjaer will return to the Old Trafford touchline when the Scot returns to his duties as Under-18s boss.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Well, this isn’t the news Manchester United would have wanted, but their side are behind against Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Brajan Gruda has opened the scoring, but there is still a long way to go at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw is absent from the squad against Brighton today due to rotation. Shaw has started four games in 16 days, and the decision has been made to rest him for the FA Cup third round.",
      "United sources have said Shaw has been left out because of his \"busy schedule\" over the last few weeks. Shaw has struggled with injuries throughout his time in Manchester. The defender missed 26 games due to injury last season, but has been available for almost every match this term.",
      "The England international's only previous squad absence this season was against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round in August. Shaw was rested for that game at Blundell Park.",
      "United are in action today against Brighton in the FA Cup.",
      "Kick-off is at 4.30pm but build-up has already started ahead of the clash at Old Trafford. Click HERE to join us.",
      "Barcelona want to keep Marcus Rashford at the club beyond the end of his loan spell, according to The Athletic.",
      "The forward is currently on loan until the end of the season with a £26m permanent option. Rashford has scored seven goals and registered 11 assists across 26 appearances.",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "The Sun have reported that Jason Wilcox has questioned Ruben Amorim's tactics and told him he lacked the pedigree of other coaches under consideration.",
      "Wilcox is said to have described himself as 'like a manager' and emphasised that Amorim was the coach. However, it remains unclear whether he said this directly to Amorim during last Friday's infamous meeting, when the Portuguese 'blew up'.",
      "But Amorim was made aware of the remarks, prompting his extraordinary outburst after United's 1–1 draw at Leeds.",
      "Man United hope to make an interim appointment by 'early next week', claims ESPN.",
      "ESPN add that next week will be crucial for the club. Ruud van Nistelrooy believes he is 'lower down' the shortlist, while Solskjaer has emerged as the favourite to step in and Carrick is also being mentioned prominently.",
      "However, re‑appointing the Norwegian would require rebuilding his backroom staff, as his previous team included Michael Carrick, Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - now the manager of Ipswich Town.",
      "AS Roma director Ricky Massara has insisted that Man United have 'closed off' all transfer talks following the change in manager.",
      "He said: \"At the moment, United have closed off all transfer talks after the change of manager. I doubt they'll change their minds.\"",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had emerged as a potential target for the Italian giants, but a January loan move now appears unlikely due to the club’s managerial situation.",
      "According to ESPN, one complication in appointing Solskjaer until the end of the season concerns the make‑up of his backroom staff.",
      "The Norweigian is one of the contenders to take over at Man United.",

      "Stay tuned and we will bring you everything you need to know on this Sunday morning...",
      "Keane has suggested that Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe offers the ideal mix of experience and composure to take the Msn United forward.",
      "\"He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen with our previous [appointments], we like people with emotions, but he's got that calmness. The job he's done at Newcastle, Champions League and winning a cup, I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "According to The Sun, Jason Wilcox had questioned Amorim's tactics and told him he lacked the pedigree of other coaches under consideration.",
      "It's said that training‑ground sources say Wilcox described himself as 'like a manager' and emphasised that Amorim was the coach. However, it remains unclear whether he said this directly to Amorim during last Friday's infamous meeting, when the Portuguese 'blew up'",
      "But Amorim was made aware of the remarks, prompting his extraordinary outburst after United's 1–1 draw at Leeds, where he insisted on being referred to as the club’s 'manager' rather than 'head coach.'",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (£65m) and Matheus Cunha (£63m) arrived for substantial fees in the summer to fill those roles. However, under Solskjaer, United are likely to take a different approach - a scenario Ineos hadn’t anticipated when signing off on the pair's arrivals.",
      "Solskjaer favoured a wide approach, using both full‑backs in a flat back four and deploying wingers either side of a central striker and a No.10. This preference for wingers continued during his mixed eight‑month spell at Besiktas.",
      "The Norweigian didn't get the players he felt he needed in Turkey, which arguably contributed to his dismissal in August after the Istanbul giants were knocked out in the play‑off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League. Turkish football expert and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit believes Solskjaer was hampered by a lack of quality wide players.",
      "He said the style of play 'wasn’t great,' largely because of the squad's limitations, adding that the football was 'decent at times but never scintillating.'",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him,\" Bayazit added. \"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "There's no reason Mbeumo and Cunha couldn't feature together under Solskjaer, though it's unlikely to be in a dual No.10 system.",
      "Man United hope to make an interim appointment by 'early next week', claims ESPN.",
      "The club are still weighing up who will step in to lead the first team following the departure of Ruben Amorim. United are pressing ahead with plans to appoint an interim coach until the summer before choosing Amorim’s permanent successor, with Michael Carrick and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer both under consideration for the short‑term role.",
      "ESPN add that next week will be crucial for the club. Ruud van Nistelrooy believes he is 'lower down' the shortlist, while Solskjaer has emerged as the favourite to step in and Carrick is also being mentioned prominently.",
      "However, re‑appointing the Norwegian would require rebuilding his backroom staff, as his previous team included Michael Carrick, Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna - now the manager of Ipswich Town.",
      "Amad has opened up about the sacking of manager Ruben Amorim, likening the Portuguese to a father figure. \"It was a tough topic,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I was a bit sad, because he's the coach who gave me more visibility and more opportunities to play for Man United. I was very sad. I even sent him a message to thank him for everything he did for me - in my life and especially in my career.",
      "\"I wished him good luck wherever he goes. It was a difficult moment for me, but I'm really focused on Ivory Coast and on this competition. I want to finish well here and try to win this AFCON.",
      "Amad continued: \"We had a very good relationship, almost like a father-and-son relationship. He understood me, and gave me a lot of advice, and let me play freely. It's very unfortunate, but that's life. You have to adapt, that's football.",
      "\"I wish him all the best in life and his next club. My focus is Ivory Coast. I have to give everything for the country.\"",
      "AS Roma director Ricky Massara claims Man United have 'closed off' all transfer talks following the change in manager.",
      "He said: \"At the moment, United have closed off all transfer talks after the change of manager. I doubt they'll change their minds.\"",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy 'remains in contention' for the Man United job, claims ESPN.",
      "However, sources close to the Dutchman suggest he believes he sits further down the list of candidates.",
      "According to ESPN, one complication in appointing Solskjaer until the end of the season concerns the make‑up of his backroom staff.",
      "The Norweigian is one of the contenders to take over at Man United.",
      "Neville has declared Carlo Ancelotti the outstanding candidate to take over at Man United and would be happy to wait until after the World Cup for the Brazil boss.",
      "\"With the last 12 years being a period of massive underperformance for Manchester United managers, there are certain boxes the next candidate now needs to tick,\" wrote Neville in the Overlap newsletter. \"1. You have to be able to handle the media and the noise that comes with this club. It is what it is so get over it and deal with it. It’s why you’re getting paid the big bucks.",
      "\"2. You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "\"3. You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it’s different to competing in many of the European leagues. 4. You have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1/ 4-2-3-1.",
      "\"You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final. No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically the club met with Carlo shortly before his retirement in 2013 and we could have short circuited this entire process and started with him at the beginning of the cycle.",
      "\"But by that stage he was close to agreeing to joining Real Madrid for his first spell in charge and so what might have been a perfect appointment never happened.\"",
      "The MEN's Manchester Football writer Tyrone Marshall believes McKenna does not have a genuine chance of taking over as manager at Man United.",
      "He said: \"I don't think so, not this time. He was in the conversation in the summer of 2024, when Ten Hag survived by the skin of his teeth, but it would have been a gamble then and would be a gamble now. Ipswich were relegated last season and while that was expected, it is still a mark on his CV.",
      "\"They are third in the Championship and if McKenna can get them promoted again and then enjoy a solid campaign next year, maybe he will be in line for a top job, but handing the United job permanently to someone currently working in the Championship feels a bridge too far.\"",
      "Manchester United-linked Oliver Glasner watched his Crystal Palace side crash out of the FA Cup to non-league Macclesfield on Saturday.",
      "Macclesfield's victory in the third round is being billed as the greatest upset in FA Cup history. The two teams are separated by 117 places in the English football pyramid.",
      "But the fearless sixth-tier hosts battled to a famous victory over the team which stunned Manchester City 1-0 in last season's final to lift their first major trophy.",

      "Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are the only two Reds stars currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations after Bryan Mbeumo's Cameroon lost to Mazraoui's Morocco on Friday night.",
      "Amad will be in action for the Ivory Coast against Egypt on Saturday night. If the Ivorians win, they will progress to a semi-final against Senegal on January 14, just three days before the Manchester derby, putting Amad's participation in that match against Manchester City in doubt.",

Michael Carrick is also in the frame to take charge before United appoint a long-term successor to the sacked Ruben Amorim in the summer, when more top-tier managers will be available.",

They are certainly fans of nostalgia around these parts and it's Manchester City and Arsenal up next.",

      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",

      "There were positives to take from the Burnley game, but this has been regression from United.",

      "Fernandes just screamed in frustration as his pass to Sesko failed to be controlled by the centre-forward. There was a little bit too much on it, meaning Sesko had little chance of latching onto the pass.",
      "United’s right side is malfunctioning at the moment. A lot of the play coming over this way, but Dalot been poor and Mount struggling with the width. Kadioglu also really exposing Mount when it comes to running in the other direction. It’s a strength for Brighton at the moment.",
      "United are struggling to build up from the back because Brighton are so well-coached.",
      "Brighton almost played all the way through United from their goalkeeper, but Dorgu recovered to thwart the danger. Dorgu has been in decent form over the last few weeks and has started well again today.",
      "United made a really quick start to the game, creating a handful of chances, but have faded.",
      "That is a disastrous goal to concede for United. The space and overload against Dalot was worked so easily and the marking in the middle was poor as well. They had started so well but that is basic stuff. Lucky not to concede a second with some poor distribution from Lammens. Suddenly rocking here and need to steady the ship. They have to get better defensively.",
      "I'm not sure what was going on down that flank. Brighton were given far too much space and time. Fletcher is watching a replay of the goal alongside Binnion on the bench, trying to work out who was responsible. Mount was pulled out of position and Dalot was left totally exposed.",
      "Brighton have taken the lead through Gruda at the Stretford End.",
      "Fletcher turned around to his bench and shook his head.",
      "\"We want the Glazers out,\" is the chant currently coming from the Stretford End.",
      "It felt like United would start games very passively here under Amorim, there was a strange lack of tempo and intensity, but they’ve come flying out the blocks today. No surprise under a head coach like Fletcher, who had the shackles off on Wednesday, but it has immediately got the crowd into it as well.",
      "Fletcher applauds Mainoo for dropping in between the defenders, picking up the ball from Lammens and turning. Mainoo is brilliant at that - he provides the team with an outlet to play from the back.",
      "Huge chance for Dalot but his finish was tame and straight at Steele.",
      "It was a gorgeous ball from Cunha, who picked the ball up from deep."

      "Marcus Rashford’s time as an official Manchester United player looks to be coming to an end, but the club could end up missing out on millions from his potential exit. Rashford is spending the season on loan at Barcelona, having expressed a desire to leave Old Trafford last summer.",
      "Barcelona are thought to have an option to make the move for Rashford permanent at the end of the season, with a set fee believed to be around £26million.",
      "A report earlier this week claimed that Rashford and his representatives have been informed by Barcelona of their desire to make the move for the England international permanent this summer.",
      "Rashford has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists during his time with the La Liga giants, and the speculation about the forward’s future ramped up this week following Ruben Amorim’s departure from Old Trafford.",
      "Prior to the January transfer window opening, a report emerged claiming that Paris Saint-Germain had an interest in signing Rashford once his loan spell at Barcelona came to an end.",

Rashford stated in an interview with Sport last month that it was his wish to join Barcelona on a permanent basis.",
      "\"Of course what I want is to stay at Barca,\" Rashford said.",

      "Darren Fletcher at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Manchester United could be set for wholesale changes as the club looks to navigate its current state of turmoil.",
      "Ruben Amorim was relieved of his duties as head coach earlier this week following a gruelling 14-month tenure, during which he grew increasingly frustrated with transfer dealings and seemingly fell out with the club’s hierarchy.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has now been touted as a potential successor to interim boss Darren Fletcher in the role of caretaker manager. United CEO Omar Berrada and Director of Football Jason Wilcox have met with the former player and manager over the weekend.",
      "This development could significantly impact United's transfer activity this month, compared to the situation when the January window first opened 11 days ago.",
      "There are reportedly concerns among Bruno Fernandes' team-mates that he may have had enough of the chaos at United and could leave in the summer after six years at the club. The 31-year-old United captain was heavily linked with a move away last summer following a reported £100m offer from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes admitted in November that he felt \"hurt\" and \"sad\" when United's bosses considered selling him, crediting his fellow countryman Amorim for convincing him to stay in Manchester. However, with Amorim now gone, The Sun reports Fernandes' team-mates believe he will finally make a move away in the coming months.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future may lie elsewhere(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "An insider reportedly said: “Some of the squad think Bruno has had enough and, to be honest, they don’t blame him. He always gives 100 per cent and has been the club’s best player since he joined.",
      "“But they think that he feels let down under the new ownership model and Amorim leaving has not helped. He isn’t a likely candidate for a big-money move to Saudi because he’s a football purist.",
      "“But no one can doubt from the moment he signed for Manchester United, he has given his all. No one wants him to leave — but his team-mates would understand if he did.”",
      "Amorim's sacking could impact United's recruitment plans, with reports suggesting they may miss out on signing Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi. Tuttosport reported Senesi, whose contract expires in the summer, was approached by United in December about a potential end-of-season move.",
      "The 28-year-old Argentine centre-back is not expected to sign a new deal, which would have put United in a position to secure him on a free transfer. However, the report claims United are \"busy with other matters\" following Amorim's dismissal.",
      "Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi had been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "As United's primary focus is currently on resolving their managerial issue and \"various shake-ups\" at Old Trafford, Senesi appears to have been temporarily sidelined. This could potentially allow other clubs to gain an advantage over the Red Devils.",
      "Italian giants Juventus are reportedly interested and are planning to begin talks with Senesi's camp next week. Barcelona are also said to have been in touch with his representatives.",

      "Manchester United begin their FA Cup campaign this afternoon with the pressure firmly on the Reds to progress to the fourth round of the competition. An early Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby Town piles the expectation on United to advance and give the fans some hope of silverware this season.",
      "As such, interim head coach Darren Fletcher will be eager to keep his side relatively strong, particularly with a challenging Brighton and Hove Albion team visiting the Theatre of Dreams. That does not mean Fletcher will be against making changes though in a bid to keep his squad fresh.",
      "Ayden Heaven has been used plenty over Christmas and New Year so there is certainly a case for dropping him to the bench and welcoming Leny Yoro back into the starting XI. The Frenchman is a year older than Heaven and has played a part in every single Premier League match this season.",
      "However, his confidence has been knocked recently so a positive performance against Brighton could be just what he needs to kickstart his 2026. In midfield, Casemiro looked tired at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. Two holding midfielders are not necessarily the way to go in a 4-2-3-1 system so playing Kobbie Mainoo alongside Manuel Ugarte would be a positive alteration.",
      "Fletcher admitted Mainoo was hard to read on Friday, so it was unclear if he was happy or not at present, but a start at Old Trafford would certainly perk him up. Perhaps the biggest decision Fletcher could make would be to give Shea Lacey his full debut for the club. The 18-year-old only had six minutes at Burnley but he made that count as he showed plenty of attacking promise down the right-hand side and nearly bagged himself his first goal for the club in the process.",
      "Fletcher spoke at length in his press conference about the academy and how pleased he has been with the attitude of the youngsters. This is in stark contrast to Amorim's complaints not too long ago. Alongside Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha, the teenager would have plenty of experience to help him through what could be a tough game.",
      "Finally, fresh off the back of a brace at Turf Moor, Benjamin Sesko deserves a chance to keep that momentum going in the FA Cup.",

      "United have held talks with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over taking the interim job until the end of the season, but Fletcher will get the chance to oversee the Brighton game. Regarding the team news, Matthijs de Ligt remains unavailable. Harry Maguire's surprise inclusion on Wednesday night will be repeated on Sunday with Fletcher confirming the same players are available this weekend as they were at Burnley.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up...",
      "United can't afford to make too many changes here, they need a cup run and they need the games that come with it. I would make one change at the back, with Leny Yoro getting a chance instead of Heaven, who deserves the breather after a busy run in the side.",
      "Casemiro is a player who could do with a rest for a different reason. He looked fatigued against Burnley and Manuel Ugarte was solid, so he can play the holding role. Kobbie Mainoo can come in with Bruno Fernandes also in midfield.",
      "Patrick Dorgu would be unlucky to miss out but this feels like a chance to give a start to Shea Lacey, who made that electric impact off the bench in midweek. Matheus Cunha has to play again and Benjamin Sesko can build on his impact against Burnley.",
      "Tyrone Marshall's Manchester United XI to take on Brighton in the FA Cup third round(Image: )",

      "Ugarte emerged with credit at Turf Moor while Casemiro underperformed. The Brazilian looked in need of a rest, so I would move him to the bench and give Mainoo just his second start of the season.",
      "Dorgu played a wonderful cross to Sesko for his second goal against Burnley, but Lacey's exciting cameo was full of promise, and I'd give the youngster his full debut on the right side. Lacey has been underutilised this season and could bring some magic to Old Trafford.",
      "Steven Railston's Manchester United XI to take on Brighton in the FA Cup(Image: )",
      "United may want to take a few risks in the FA Cup. Fletcher needs to find a balance between resting some key players while keeping the team strong enough to advance.",

Bringing Luke Shaw out of the team could also be a wise move to give United the chance to try out Dorgu at left-back ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) absentees returning.",
      "Casemiro desperately needs a rest so bringing Mainoo in to replace him allows that to happen.

      "Benjamin Sesko enjoyed his best night in a United shirt against Burnley(Image: )",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher(Image: Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Since the summer, Bruno Fernandes has been playing deeper in midfield to make room for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the No.10 roles.",
      "\"I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep, to have more possession, to try to control the game more - and we're doing that,\" Amorim said in September before admitting: \"Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front, maybe because Matheus Cunha was not there.",
      "\"But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player. So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.\"",
      "As Amorim explained, even in the deeper role Fernandes was still influential for the Reds, but there was always the feeling he could offer more if played further forward. In his first game in charge, Fletcher scrapped the Fernandes experiment and put him back into attacking midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes with Darren Fletcher after being substituted vs Burnley(Image: )",
      "Fernandes will always play wherever the manager wants him, but United fans have been crying out for him to play more advanced and despite only just coming back from injury this week, the captain showed why this is a better option for United. Within five minutes of the restart, the 31-year-old produced a sublime through ball for Benjamin Sesko to finish.",
      "Due to his minutes being managed, Fernandes only lasted another ten minutes before being substituted but the promising signs are there. United look a better team when Fernandes is playing behind the striker and considering he scored 19 goals from this role last season, moving him further up the pitch makes sense.",
      "This decision is not just better for Fernandes, it also improves the United squad as a whole. When everyone is back fit and available, Mbeumo can play off the right in a 4-2-3-1 system with Cunha cutting in from the left and Fernandes down the middle.",
      "Those wishing to see more of Kobbie Mainoo will also be pleased. With Fernandes pushed further up-field, Mainoo could slot alongside Casemiro to provide a stronger central midfield partnership. A change to Fernandes' role is best for United, his teammates and the captain.",
      "Fernandes has still been influential in midfield this season, but United look a better team when he's played further forward.",

      "Manchester United suffered another setback in the race for Champions League football as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's first game in charge. United started slowly and went behind after 13 minutes. Casemiro was caught out by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's weak attempt at blocking the cross saw the ball loop in off the centre-back.",
      "Fletcher's side soon took control and two Benjamin Sesko goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half looked to have turned it around. He finished smartly from a Bruno Fernandes pass and Patrick Dorgu cross. Somehow, United let the hosts back into it. They had barely threatened in the second half when Lisandro Martinez let Jaidon Anthony turn and deliver a curling finish.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Turf Moor:",
      "Senne Lammens: Decision to try and read the cross from Humphreys not a good one but powerless with the second goal. Good with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Tidy in possession and tried to get forward in the second half, but didn't have much of an impact. United's narrow approach didn't get him much of the ball. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Turned away from the cross that saw the ball loop in off him, when he should have made himself bigger. Aggressive on the ball at times. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: His weakest game since his return to the side. One wild shot and way too passive against Anthony in the area, giving the winger too much space to equalise. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Got forward well and had an impact in that area. Linked well with Dorgu and made some clever runs, both overlapping and underlapping. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Got quite far forward at times, and although his two shots at goal were wayward, he had a solid game and was better with the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro: A shadow of the player who had done so well earlier in the season. Just watched Humphreys run off him for the first goal, was booked and just too slow to react at times. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Picked a brilliant pass to create the equaliser for Sesko and wanted as much of the ball as he could get. Looked a creative force. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Playing everywhere at the moment. Something of a surprise to see him on the left but gave Kyle Walker a hard time and his cross was perfect for Sesko. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Quieter than he has been in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much for being moved centrally. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: His best game for the club. Had plenty of chances, held the ball up well, took his two goals brilliantly and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Another centre-half change. Did fine. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled to match the impact of Fernandes. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Came on in a deep area and tried to get on the ball. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Couple of half chances but couldn't take them. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: So unlucky not to score with a brilliant piece of play. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Maguire, Malacia, J. Fletcher",

      "Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",
      "United have dropped points against the Premier League's bottom seven teams across the last 10 weeks: Tottenham, Bournemouth, Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Burnley and Wolves.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas in August(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "On the mess Solskjaer inherited 12 months ago, following the sacking of Giovanni Van Bronckhorst, Bayazit told MEN Sport: \"It was probably the lowest point I'd seen Besiktas at in my 25 years of following the club. It was a really difficult job to come into.",
      "\"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Solskjaer led Besiktas to some memorable victories(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big games included a win over Galatasaray that preserved a piece of Besiktas history. Bayazit said: \"He's the first manager to win all three big domestic matches in a single half of a season since Besiktas won the league in 2021.",
      "\"He beat Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Galatasray. It was Galatasaray's only loss of the season, which was very significant for Besiktas because they're the only 'Invincibles' in Turkish football history, so beating them was very important.\"",
      "Solskjaer lost his job because of a panicky president, according to Kaan Bayazit(Image: Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "However, Solskjaer still didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit is adamant Solskjaer didn't deserve the sack and that he was a victim of a president who caved to media pressure.",
      "\"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs,\" he said. \"I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.' The president has a tenure for three years, then he has to get re-elected, so there is a lot of pressure on them for instant success.",
      "\"But Ole definitely wasn't backed and I would say the Turkish media really had it out for him. Despite the fact he is a model professional and a gentleman, he doesn't leak stuff to the media. He didn't give the media breadcrumbs.\"",
      "Bayazit saw enough of Solskjaer at Besiktas to suggest he is the right short-term option for United following Ruben Amorim's sacking. He added: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"A lot of those players have been told by Ruben Amorim that they aren't good enough. I think that's something Ole will be able to solve short-term.",
      "Solskjaer would help solve some of United's short-term issues, according to Besiktas podcaster Bayazit(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",
      "As a close follower of English football too, Bayazit believes there are similarities between Besiktas and United. He said: \"I've got to know a lot of Manchester United fans recently and the resemblance between them and Besiktas is remarkable, from the state of the squad, backroom politics, the noise around the club, the pressure.",
      "\"That's something people who don't follow Turkish football don't realise. The pressure is so much bigger than 95 per cent of football clubs. Only the biggest clubs in the world know the pressure of the three biggest clubs in Turkey. It's from the fans, the media.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's a regretful that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos. It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. But it got blown up by the president who's very reactionary.\"",

Darren Fletcher has taken charge on an interim basis and oversaw the encounter against Burnley, which finished 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round tie against Premier League rivals, Brighton.",

Wilcox a man with just nine months’ experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar’s belief.",

      "Shea Lacey produced a thrilling cameo for United at Burnley(Image: )",
      "Darren Fletcher has backed Shea Lacey to play a \"big part\" in Manchester United's future after the 18-year-old's impressive cameo at Turf Moor in Fletcher's first game in charge. The 18-year-old came on with six minutes to go against Burnley and hit the crossbar with one superb strike before sending another shot from range fizzing just wide of the post.",
      "It was Lacey's second appearance for the first team and the first sign of the talent that has marked him out as one to watch within the academy. Fletcher showed faith in throwing him on as United chased a winner and the youngster almost delivered.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" said Fletcher. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "Lacey's efforts were part of a much better attacking display from United, who had 30 shots against the Clarets. They hit the woodwork twice, had two cleared off the line and saw a Lisandro Martinez goal controversially disallowed for a foul.",
      "Fletcher had told his players to go out and entertain, and he was pleased to see United produce a much better attacking display.",

      "\"I think, as I said, it wasn't perfect, but there was lots of good things within that. I think if we look back on that game, barring probably the start and then after we went 2-1 up, I think the rest of the game is pretty much total domination and creating lots of chances.",
      "\"We probably look at and are disappointed we've not scored more goals because we've got to score more goals when you create that many chances.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Ally McCoist believes there’s an “acceptance” of where Manchester United now are, as caretaker boss Darren Fletcher has admitted his players are “fragile.”",
      "Reports suggest that United want their new manager in the door by next weekend, when they face rivals Manchester City. That’s probably for the best after the ignominy of Fletcher’s two-game spell.",
      "In the wake of the sacking of Ruben Amorim, Fletcher led United to a 2-2 Premier League draw to 19th-placed Burnley, before they lost to Brighton in the third round of the FA Cup.",
      "United went 1-0 down in the 12th minute, and former Red Devil Danny Welbeck followed Brajan Gruda’s goal with his own in the 65th minute to send the Seagulls 2-0 up.",
      "United fought their way back with an 85th-minute Benjamin Sesko strike – his third in two games – but could’t mount any more pressure on Brighton, with youngster Shea Lacey’s late sending off not helping them in that respect.",
      "He said: “They had a lot of possession, United, but they didn’t do enough with it.",
      "“The second goal knocked the stuffing out of them. There’s no real belief in this team.",
      "“The crowd got going for the Sesko goal but at the whistle you can hear a pin drop. There’s an acceptance, now, of where United are and what’s happening.”",
      "Fletcher himself has admitted the players are flat, and feels the fans are unhappy at current proceedings.",
      "READ: Carrick ‘open to’ Man Utd assistant role after Solskjaer talks with Berrada and Wilcox",
      "“I think you could see the players are fragile but they’ve got to respond. Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football so when you don’t have it, you have to dig deep and then the confidence comes back.",
      "“It’s over to them, they need to make sure that they have got a lot to play for this season. This team is still good enough to achieve success this season but they have to dig deep.",
      "Fletcher then told BBC: “Out of cups, only Premier League games to play for, the fans weren’t happy at the end but they have got every right to air their grievances. It wasn’t toxic but they showed their disappointment. I’m sure if the players show the right reaction, the fans will get behind them like they always do because there is still a lot to play for in the Premier League this season.”"

      "Out of the cup and, if reports around their managerial search are to be believed, Manchester United are completely out of ideas.",
      "Darren Fletcher’s two-game spell as the interim-interim manager concluded with the Red Devils’ first ever FA Cup defeat to Brighton. Which sounds stark, but the wrong context in which to view this latest defeat. The Seagulls have now won four of their last five visits to AmEx North. Losing at home to Brighton is just one of those things that Manchester United do.",
      "Not to worry, though, Reds because here comes Ole Gunner Solskjaer and/or Michael Carrick. Just what this situation needs: another blast from the past.",
      "It worked before, right? At least until it didn’t. Solskjaer swept in at the end 2018 and powered by little more than sunshine and smiles, enticed a string of results from a squad that decided it cared little for the standards demanded by Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer lost one game in 17 – even that defeat to PSG provided the platform for a stirring fightback in Paris – which got him the permanent job. The United legend took Mourinho’s team from sixth in December to, at the end of the season…. sixth.",
      "Still, given how tight the Premier League is this season, a similar run now would go a long way to securing a Champions League place. Which Jason Wilcox reckons is achievable. Especially since literally nothing else is.",
      "That may be one reason Wilcox feels that, right now, United need a shot in the arm of nostalgia. More likely, the director of football believes that United fans will be more uncomfortable showing their dissent if one of their own, a man who quite possible still sleeps under a Man Utd bedspread, is back at the wheel.",
      "Wilcox, not for the first time, would be wrong. Fletcher’s past glories could not spare him boos at half-time and full-time today from a fan base that isn’t likely to be fooled again by the novelty. The Stretford End have Wilcox and Sir Jim Ratcliffe in their sights and no one on United’s roll of honour will serve as a human shield big enough to spare them the flak.",
      "They will do it anyway, because what else can they do? Few would back the United brains trust to find a suitable manager in the six months between now and the summer. In a week? No chance.",
      "There is an important difference too which Wilcox may well have missed: this group is not as good as the group Solskjaer inherited from Mourinho.",
      "A few months before Mourinho lost the dressing room, he drove them to a runners-up finish in the Premier League. As they showed under Solskjaer, when the whim took them, that squad could play.",
      "This one, by any measure, is not a very good team. For a long time it was believed that they were being held back by Ruben Amorim and his weird devotion to a system that was never going to work at Old Trafford. And that was certainly a factor. But as we’ve seen in the week since the Portuguese was axed, a change of shape cannot compensate for an inability to consistently get the basics right.",
      "This Manchester United is a moments team. For good and bad. And the bad will always render the good a wasted effort.",
      "We saw it before 15 minutes had ticked over at Old Trafford. In the Brighton box, United created a couple of big chances, one for Diogo Dalot and another Benjamin Sesko, that were struck straight at Jason Steele, one of six changes made by Fabian Hurzeler to United’s three. This was hardly the Seagulls’ stiffs, but still.",
      "Defensively, United allowed Brighton the freedom of their box to take the lead. Fault could be found across the back four for not getting close enough to avert danger, or even sniff it. It is a recurring problem among these United players: the lack of willingness or capability to deny opponents space, perhaps assuming that everyone else is as wasteful as they are.",
      "Confidence is low, sure, and that will be a factor in the attacking flaws. Defensively, though, the easiest way to take encouragement is by winning duels and battles. United too often take the approach that you can’t lose the ones you don’t enter.",
      "We have heard lots on United’s ‘DNA’ this week, a concept so loose that no one can really define it. Indisputably, it features youth, and one of the few wins this week were the cameos of Shea Lacey. But he and United even managed to turn that into an L.",
      "United’s support urged the players to find Lacey on the right after the 18-year-old replaced Mason Mount and, always eager to shirk responsibility, his senior team-mates were happy to oblige. Lacey again went close to a first senior goal before he showed that the self-sabotage streak runs down from the first-team to the academy.",
      "A poor tackle earned him his first caution on 89 minutes and, two minutes later, he reacted angrily to another foul given against him, slamming the ball to the floor. United may wish that Simon Hooper took a more lenient view, but what else could the official have done? In the modern game, it is as clear a caution as you can see.",
      "Of course, it won’t be held against the kid and nor should it be. Pre-match, Fletcher was talking about JJ Gabriel a 15-year-old also tearing it up in the youth teams. But there is no saviour coming though the ranks no mater how hard United cling to that particular comfort blanket.",
      "Instead, Wilcox will probably choose to let Solskjaer, United’s emotional support dog, run free in the hope of boosting morale at Old Trafford. But vibes won’t fix this United.",
      "A club so big cannot possibly write off the rest of the season. But they almost already have. Each action and every game between now and May will just be a box ticked before yet another great summer reset, led by men who have proved hopelessly incapable of leading one.",
      "Premier League clubs made between four and eight changes in the FA Cup, with some fringe players impressing and others needing to ‘look in the mirror’.",
      "They go by a variety of titles but these are the men who carry the clout in the Premier League, the fellas who decide the destiny of your club…",
      "Spurs were almost entirely awful for all but five great second-half minutes against Aston Villa – and that will keep Thomas Frank in gainful employment.",
      "Oliver Glasner said himself Crystal Palace would be ‘punished’ if they were ‘arrogant’ at Macclesfield. In defeat he claimed they shouldn’t even need a manager.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after draws against Leeds United, Fulham and Arsenal…",

He even scored a penalty against Wigan in the semi-final shootout, making him the least pointless signing on this list. The Swede himself admitted his time at Arsenal was bizarre, writing on the club’s official website that he was “not meant” to take a penalty for the Gunners at Wembley Stadium.",
      "Arsene Wenger must have really wanted Kallstrom to sign him while he had a serious back injury; either that or Arsene simply knew the former Lyon man would play a brief but crucial role in ending the north Londoners’ long wait for a trophy.",
      "Kallstrom had to wait over three weeks just to make the bench, and his first involvement came in Wenger’s 1,000th game as Arsenal boss, everyone knows how that went. The experienced midfielder played 11 minutes against Swansea City a few days later and was an unused substitute more often than not until the end of the season.",
      "He did get 90 minutes under his belt in a 3-1 win over West Ham and, of course, played seven minutes of extra time against Wigan before converting the second Gunners spot-kick of the penalty shootout.",

      "He came off the bench in the Premier League three times. His Reds debut came against Arsenal with Liverpool trailing 3-2 in the 88th minute; the match finished 3-3 after a Joe Allen goal. Make of that what you will.",
      "Next up: Manchester United. His one-minute cameo was not quite as successful. He entered the pitch with Liverpool 1-0 down and that’s how it finished.",
      "Then came Norwich City at Carrow Road, the famous 5-4 victory in which Klopp broke his glasses celebrating Adam Lallana’s 95th-minute winner. Caulker entered the pitch in the 90th minute with Liverpool 4-3 up before the true carnage unfolded. Sebastien Bassong equalised before Lallana’s bouncing volley won it for the Reds.",
      "That was Caulker’s final Premier League appearance for the club. All three of his league games in red came within the space of ten days.",
      "A week later, he played his final match for Liverpool: a 0-0 draw against West Ham in the FA Cup. He did not make the squad for the replay, when Liverpool were knocked out in extra time.",

      "Suarez played 67 minutes in the Premier League across four matches. His debut came against Manchester City, essentially completing a bleep test for his half-hour on the pitch. The score was 3-1 when he came on and remained so, with little happening after Sergio Aguero completed his hat-trick in the 61st minute.",

      "When Suarez joined, then-Arsenal boss Unai Emery praised his versatility. In fairness, the midfielder was used in three different positions, right, left and centrally. All pretty pointlessly.",
      "Unfortunately for both club and player, Suarez picked up an injury and missed Arsenal’s final ten competitive matches of the season. He had won the Europa League in 2015 with Emery at Sevilla and was perhaps brought in as nothing more than a good-luck charm. Maybe his presence on the bench would have changed the outcome of the final against Chelsea?",

      "It didn’t help that Jesse Marsch, the manager McKennie signed to play for, was sacked a week after his arrival.",
      "McKennie made 19 Premier League appearances and registered just one assist. “I didn’t have the best performances. I felt I let certain people down,” he later admitted.",

      "The following season felt like his last chance. A January loan to QPR offered regular Premier League football, or so it seemed. He played three league games and three FA Cup matches, scored no goals, and returned to United early due to injury.",

      "Signing a player on loan only to have him sit on the bench for 99% of his spell is baffling. Perhaps Chelsea were trying to boost their popularity in Brazil?",

Olabe, the former Real Sociedad sporting director, was appointed as president of football operations in late 2025. The 58-year-old played with Emery at La Real, and had a very brief spell as coach before taking executive roles.

When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",

And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",

It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",

      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",

It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",

      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",

      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",

But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided who is the ‘heavy favourite’ to be their next permanent manager as they have five ‘top candidates’.",
      "The Red Devils are currently working on a succession plan after deciding to part ways with former head coach Ruben Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "Amorim was fortunate to last 14 months at Man Utd due to their dire performances and results in several competitions, while he also faced criticism due to his naive refusal to adapt his philosophy.",
      "The final straw came when he clashed with director of football Jason Wilcox in a tense meeting, which led to Amorim publicly criticising the club’s chiefs in a press conference.",
      "Following his exit, Man Utd have been working on appointing an interim boss until the summer, at which point they will look to bring in a more established manager to provide a long-term solution.",
      "READ: Is this the least surprising ‘shock call’ over who Manchester United should appoint as their next manager?",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are currently vying for the interim role, while several top-tier managers are linked with Man Utd ahead of potential moves to Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "This includes Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner and England’s Thomas Tuchel, who have been mooted as leading contenders to be Man Utd’s next permanent boss.",
      "Now, a report from Caught Offside claims Glasner is currently the ‘heavy favourite’ to join Man Utd in the summer, but he and Tuchel are among the ‘five top candidates’.",
      "Regarding Man Utd’s other candidates, the report explains: ‘One other particularly tempting option for United could be England manager Thomas Tuchel, but the issue there is that his focus this summer will be on the World Cup.",
      "‘Others to watch out for will be former Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, even if Manchester City looks more likely, along with Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Ipswich Town’s Kieran McKenna.’",
      "Despite this, Fabrizio Romano has claimed that the Red Devils are not currently making a move for Maresca, who is also linked with Manchester City.",
      "Romano explained: “Man City are interested in Enzo Maresca for the future. It’s not something imminent, it’s not something guaranteed, it’s something for the future, if Maresca will be available as a manager when Pep Guardiola decides to leave. But Pep has not decided anything at this stage.",
      "“From Man Utd, the message is a different kind of coach for the summer, not a coach for now.",
      "“This is why the links from Italy with Maresca taking the Man Utd job immediately are something that I’m told is not concrete at all at this stage.",
      "“Man Utd will take their time to start the process and try to understand who is the best manager possible for the season 2026/2027.”",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner felt Crystal Palace showed “no kind of quality” and their under-21s would have done better than the senior side as they were dumped out of ...",
      "Oliver Glasner said himself Crystal Palace would be ‘punished’ if they were ‘arrogant’ at Macclesfield. In defeat he claimed they shouldn’t even need a manager.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has finally got off the fence and named his “outstanding candidate” to replace former head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have a ‘contingency plan’ regarding their head coach situation as they have four managers on their ‘exciting shortlist’.",
      "Manchester United have been told why Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner would struggle at Old Trafford, while they should avoid a “terrible” alternative.",
      "Manchester United reportedly have a new manager at the ‘top of their list’ to replace Ruben Amorim in the summer, while Oliver Glasner has made a ‘demand’."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided a “clear” update on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford’s future at FC Barcelona.",
      "England international Rashford has rebuilt his career away from Man Utd over the past 18 months, producing great performances for Aston Villa and Barcelona.",
      "The Man Utd academy product butted heads with former head coach Ruben Amorim and opted to have a fresh start elsewhere, with his impressive form on loan at Aston Villa sparking more interest in the summer.",
      "It was widely reported that the forward had his heart set on a move to Barcelona, and they made a move to sign him after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "Rashford’s versatility and return to form at Villa tempted Barcelona to take a punt on the 28-year-old, signing him on loan with an option to buy for around 30 million euros (£26m).",
      "READ: Is this the least surprising ‘shock call’ over who Manchester United should appoint as their next manager?",
      "And this transfer has gone better than Barcelona and Rashford could surely have imagined, with the attacker grabbing seven goals and eleven assists in his 24 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Therefore, it would be a no-brainer for Barcelona to sign him for a cut-price fee in the summer, but it has also been suggested that he could return to Man Utd following the sacking of Amorim.",
      "Now, Romano has explained that the Spanish giants “intend” to keep Rashford beyond this summer due to his versatility, professionalism, his presence in the dressing room and his numbers.",
      "“What I can tell you in the last 24 hours is that the message coming from Barcelona, coming directly from the club, is that in communications they had with Marcus Rashford camp, so agents, family of the player, is that they already told Rashford they would love to continue with him beyond this season,” Romano revealed on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rushford is on loan again, 30 million euros by the buy option, not mandatory. But Barcelona already told Rashford that they’re very happy with him in terms of performances, in terms of versatility, in terms of professionalism.",
      "“Rashford has been fantastic in this first half of the season at Barcelona, always super serious, super professional, never creating any problems. Very good presence, also in the dressing room, and then in terms of numbers, doing very well, but also in terms of aptitude.",
      "“May United know that Barcelona are really interested in keeping Marcos Rashford. Now, the timing for that is still too early, because at the moment, Barcelona are not going to trigger the 30 million buy option.",
      "“It’s close now, so it’s not something that will be formally done now, but for sure, Barcelona internally are already communicated with Marcus Rashford about the intention to keep him for the future.",
      "“Let’s see, of course, financially, because that part remains to be seen in the next months, but Barcelona’s intention is quite clear.",
      "“So let’s see what happens there, and not forget that for Man United, that could be important money, eventually would be 30 million euros from Rashford.”",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘closing in on a deal’ to sign a new defender, though there is one ‘final detail missing’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘tabled an offer’ for Liverpool target Yan Diomande, though a transfer hinges on one ‘huge’ condition.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed the “clear favourite” to lead Manchester United until the summer, while five factors will be behind a permanent appointment.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford and other members of the ‘bomb squad’ at Old Trafford will still leave despite Ruben Amorim’s sacking, according to reports.",
      "The new Man Utd boss will have the “final decision” on Joshua Zirkzee’s future as Fabrizio Romano reveals Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the “leading candidate”.",

      "It is between former United manager Solskjaer and ex-caretaker boss Carrick for the role, with the club’s hierarchy viewing them as separate candidates rather than a potential duo in the dugout.",
      "It has been widely reported that Solskjaer will meet United chiefs Berrada and Wilcox on Saturday, two days after the pair spoke with Carrick.",
      "Meanwhile, Ben Jacobs has reported that United never planned to appoint an interim head coach without meeting candidates in person.",

      "Jacobs wrote on X:",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hold face-to-face talks with Manchester United on Saturday over the caretaker role until the end of the season. Michael Carrick also in contention and met with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox on Thursday.",
      "Manchester United never planned to make any decision on a caretaker until formal face-to-face talks with both candidates, and a conversation with current interim Darren Fletcher. Solskjaer and Carrick have both held remote talks, but Manchester United insistent on formal and in-person interviews.",
      "It would be Solskjaer’s second spell as interim manager at Old Trafford if he is appointed.",
      "He impressed during his first stint, winning 14 of his 19 games in charge before being handed the job permanently.",
      "United’s form dipped after Solskjaer signed a three-year contract, and there may be concerns about history repeating itself if the Norwegian enjoys another strong run during the second half of the 2025/26 season.",
      "Competition: Can you manage Manchester United better than Ruben Amorim?",
      "However, the 50-year-old remaining in the role is described as a ‘real possibility’ if he guides United back into the Champions League or wins silverware — with the FA Cup the club’s only remaining route to a trophy.",
      "Speaking on Football Insider’s Inside Track podcast, Pete O’Rourke said: “I think the plan initially is for the interim boss to see through the season and then obviously United will have time then to go out there and get a full-time manager.",
      "“As you said, it’s happened before, Solskjaer stepped in, did a very good job, got the feel-good factor back at Old Trafford and that led to him getting the job on a permanent basis.",
      "“So never say never, possibly it could happen again if the interim manager comes in and does a good job.",
      "“If United win a trophy, gets them in the top four for the Champions League. That’s a real possibility.",
      "“But I think United really do want to bring in a top class manager. They’re not going to rush into anything, so bringing in an interim manager gives them time to look at other candidates.”",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Is this the least surprising ‘shock call’ over who Manchester United should appoint as their next manager?",
      "With a few of the old guard linked, Gary Neville has warned Manchester United they could get stuck in a cycle.",
      "The past is Man Utd’s biggest problem with ex-players and ex-managers dominating the narrative. They should all be blocked.",

      "The ex-midfielder has been out of work since leaving the Camp Nou in 2024 but the league title on his resume as well as his playing career would make him an attractive option for many potential suitors.",
      "One of those suitors may well be Manchester United who are searching for a new manager after sacking Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "The reported plan would be to employ an interim coach until the end of the season before appointing a full-time manager in the summer but Xavi’s current availability may change that.",
      "However, according to Fabrizio Romano, there have been no discussions between the two parties yet with the United hierarchy only having just begun the formal search for a manager.",
      "“At the moment, I am not aware of negotiations between Xavi and Manchester United,” Romano said. “United have now started the process of selecting their coach and we will have to see what can happen in the future. As of today there is nothing advanced or anything concrete.”",
      "However, Xavi is said to be open to a Premier League role and is ready to return to management having been out of the game for 19 months.",
      "“What I can say is that Xavi would love to coach in the Premier League,” Romano continued. “He feels ready to return to coaching and write a new chapter after his departure from Barcelona and taking some time to disconnect.",

      "Sunday 11 January 2026 19:59, UK",
      "Manchester United's problems continued to build after Brighton secured their place in the FA Cup fourth round with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Brajan Gruda (12) and Danny Welbeck (64) condemned United to defeat in what could well prove to be interim boss Darren Fletcher's final match before an appointment is made for the rest of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the frontrunners for a post.",
      "Defeat to Brighton sees United, who were given a late lifeline by Benjamin Sesko (85) before Shea Lacey was shown a red card (89) for two quick-fire bookings, knocked out both the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle of the competitions for the first time since the 1981/82 season, leaving them with just the Premier League to focus on as they look to qualify for Europe.",
      "The full-time whistle was greeted with boos before near silence ensued with the Man Utd supporters and players left stunned by yet another lacklustre performance. The loss means United will play just 40 games this season - their lowest since the 2014/15 campaign when they played 44 games, and Fletcher said that the fans had every right to show their displeasure.",
      "Whoever takes over will have to deal with mounting problems at Old Trafford, where there was a banner criticising the running of the club by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. There were also chants United fans are also chanting: 'We Want the Glazers Out.'",
      "United, who sacked Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge last Monday, are now without a win in four matches in all competitions and with games to come against Man City at the weekend and a trip to Arsenal, things don't get any easier.",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton's fantastic recent record continues against United. Fabian Hurzeler's side beat United for the first time in the FA Cup. They now have seven wins in nine games against United and four victories in five visits to Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher was given a warm welcome by Old Trafford as he emerged from the tunnel and his side started well, with a pair of early Jason Steele saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes keeping Brighton in the contest.",
      "Brighton had been eliminated by United in the six previous FA Cup ties between them, but they were sent on their way to ending that hoodoo when Gruda reacted quickest to lash home the rebound after Georginio Rutter's header was cleared off the line.",
      "Fletcher attempted to gee up the crowd when he returned, but there was little to cheer during a disappointingly slow start to the second period. Lacey and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced in a bid to change the dynamics, but just moments later Brighton extended their lead.",
      "Welbeck received a pass from Gruda and was all too easily able to take a touch and slam a 65th-minute shot into the top left-hand corner.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the message from the United fans as they urged their side to get back into the game. Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",
      "\"You can see that the players are fragile and they need to build themselves up. It's up to them now, they've got to respond.",
      "\"Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football and when you don't have it, you have to dig deep, you have to win, battle, fight, grind, work, win games and then the confidence comes back.",
      "\"They're experiened players, they're talented players and I challenge them to regroup. Someone is going to come in and lead them and they need to make sure they've got a lot to play for this season.",
      "\"This team is still good enough to have success this season, but they've got to dig deep and find a way within themselves.\"",
      "Last game? \"This is what I've been asked to do so I've not had any discussions beyond that. I did the job this week and we have to concentrate on the game. All the discussions around that will unfold in the next couple of days.\"",
      "\"We created enough to win the game to be honest.",
      "\"Then the red card gave us a disadvantage because we were on top of Brighton in the last moments.",

      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Sunday 11 January 2026 08:14, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Had Shea Lacey's late strike found the net rather than the frame of the goal, it would have been one of those magical Manchester United moments. A young player who the supporters had wanted Ruben Amorim to trust with more minutes proving the hero.",
      "That Lacey was on the pitch at all was a product of more than Darren Fletcher's desire to lean into United's youth legacy but an attacking switch that saw United finish the game with Burnley at Turf Moor with a midfield duo of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "The away support appreciated it, chanting Fletcher's name as well as that of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick - two men touted with a return. But United need more than mere sentiment right now, they are chasing Champions League football.",

      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",

I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",

      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",

      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",

      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",

      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",

He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",
      "The extra games United would gain from a cup run could prove very important for the rest of their season, as the new head coach (or coaches) try to bed-in their tactical system, and also get some much-needed game-time for the wider squad.",
      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",
      "In the background, of course, is the much more significant process of deciding who should be the head coach going forward.",
      "After paying around £10m in severance to Amorim and his staff, United will again want to try to avoid a big compensation bill for whomever they employ next.",
      "That is at least part of their thinking about why it is best to kick the can down the road, and postpone the big appointment until the summer.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 22:11, UK",
      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."
