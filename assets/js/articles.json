      "Alexander Isak and Newcastle United have reached a bitter stalemate as the star striker pushes for an exit. But the Swede's career could have panned out differently if he had left former employers Real Sociedad for another Premier League heavyweight three years ago.",
      "The 25-year-old made his feelings known last month when he told the Magpies he wanted to leave, and after Liverpool saw a £110million bid rejected for him, neither party has budged. Eddie Howe's side remain adamant he is not for sale and will don a Newcastle shirt this season, while the player is said to be refusing to play for the club again.",
      "Having caught Borussia Dortmund's eye whilst playing in his native Sweden, Isak signed for the German side but left for Spain in 2019 after finding minutes hard to come by. With Sociedad, he became one of La Liga's most revered strikers, leaving many top sides vying for his signature. One of those interested parties was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.",
      "Speaking in 2024, years after Isak made his Newcastle switch, Guardiola admitted: \"At Real Sociedad, we started to follow him, we were impressed. He was a target. With his skills, all the clubs around the world take a look. I think he adapted really, really well in the Premier League.\"",
      "City's reason for not pursuing Isak more vigorously? Erling Haaland. The Athletic reported in the summer of 2022 that the Norwegian was Guardiola's priority No. 1, ahead of Isak, and Haaland's arrival even persuaded him to pen a new contract with the club.",
      "The Spaniard got his way as Haaland's £51m Dortmund release clause was met that July, and he has become a two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner, scoring 85 league goals since 2022, to the 54 of Isak, who arrived in England a few months after him.",
      "City were reportedly not the only club in Manchester to admire Isak, as rivals Manchester United were claimed to have submitted a 'juicy offer' to the Swede that summer.",
      "Mundo Deportivo reported that before Isak completed his £63m move to Newcastle, the Red Devils, then led by Erik ten Hag, were in touch with his representatives, who persuaded the striker to decline their advances.",
      "Sociedad never received a bid from United for Isak, and having lost out on his signature, Ten Hag began his first season in charge with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line, though that infamously only lasted until November.",
      "Arsenal were yet another club that had Isak on their radar before he signed for the Magpies, and they perhaps came the closest to securing his signature with an informal offer.",
      "The Gunners sought to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front and saw Isak as the ideal recruit. However, when approaching him in January 2022, they encountered some discrepancies regarding the Swede's price tag.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side tabled an informal £56m offer, which was far lower than Sociedad's estimations, as they were sticking to Isak's £74.7m release clause. The Athletic reported that this fee was just too much for Arsenal, who saw him as 'overpriced,' and Isak ended up at St. James' Park the following summer while continuing to be monitored by the Gunners.",
      "A fee of £75m would now be considered a bargain for Isak, who, after Liverpool's £120m bid was rejected, is thought to be valued at a potential British record transfer sum of £150m by Newcastle.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Harry Maguire admits he was gutted to lose the Manchester United captaincy - but was thrilled Bruno Fernandes was the one given the armband.",
      "In January 2020, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer named Maguire Red Devils captain, a matter of months after his £80million move from Leicester City. His turbulent reign as skipper, which saw him face enormous levels of criticism as United struggled under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, ended in 2023, when Erik ten Hag stripped him of the captaincy.",
      "The ex-United boss handed the armband to Fernandes, who continues to wear it to this day. While Maguire admitted he was heartbroken to lose the honour, he wanted to do everything he could to help his Portuguese team-mate.",
      "Speaking on 'Rio Ferdinand Presents', Maguire said: \"When I was captain, Bruno gave me his full support. I leant on Bruno a lot to be honest.",
      "\"Whenever I had decisions to make, I had people around me like (David) De Gea, Bruno and Nemanja (Matic). I had good experienced pros there and I always leant on them. I built a good relationship with Bruno when I was captain.",
      "\"Obviously, Erik decided to change the captaincy because I was not playing in that first season. I really wanted it to go to Bruno if I’m being honest and I told Bruno the same. He came up to me and I spoke to him. I said, 'Look, congratulations.'\"",
      "When the legendary United defender pushed Maguire to offer an insight into the conversation between him and Ten Hag, the 64-cap England international said: \"It was a sticky conversation. The season before, I just didn’t feel as important to the club as I did under Ole.",
      "\"I think if you're the captain, you need to feel important, you need to have the backing of the manager, you need to have the backing of all the team. If you don't it doesn't work.",
      "\"Bruno was Erik's guy. Bruno is a great leader. Like I said to Bruno, I said, 'If I have to give it away to anyone - and I didn't want to give it away to anyone - he'd be the man I would want to take this club forward.'",
      "\"He's a fantastic player, a great leader and, most importantly, he puts other people first. I think that's a big trait to have when you are a captain. He cares about others, he cares about improving others, he cares about helping others.",
      "\"There's a lot of players in this game who obviously play for themselves, rightly so it takes them far. But there's also a lot of players who care about the team and making other people better and making young lads come through, feel comfortable and Bruno is one of those.\"",
      "Fernandes will be leading Ruben Amorim's new-look United out at Old Trafford on Saturday, when the Red Devils face Arsenal in their first match of the new Premier League campaign. Last season was shambolic for the Reds, who finished 15th and put in a lacklustre performance in their Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.",
      "While Amorim has mainly focused on bolstering his frontline with the acquisitions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, Maguire looks set to play an important role in the Portuguese boss's defence. He will be contending with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui for a place in Amorim's three-man backline.",

      "Besiktas are hoping to complete a deal to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho after a succession of other deals fell through.",
      "Sancho is in exile at United alongside fellow unwanted players Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. The bomb squad group, which previously also included Marcus Rashford before he left for Barcelona, have been told they have no future under Ruben Amorim and are looking for new clubs.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but they turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. He has since agreed terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, only for those deals to fall at the last hurdle.",
      "The 25-year-old has less than a year left on his contract with United, but his £300,000 wages are providing a stumbling block towards any exit. Borussia Dortmund and Roma have both shown an interest, yet it is Besiktas who could jump to the front of the queue after club president Serdal Adali spoke out.",
      "“Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "“Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",
      "Besiktas’ fans are extremely keen to sign Sancho, having bombarded his Instagram account with over five million messages reading “Come to Besiktas”.",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano has reported that Sancho does not share the enthusiasm of the Besiktas fanbase and isn’t keen on a move to Turkey at this stage of his career. Instead, he is planning to wait for interest in Italy to turn into an offer.",
      "But despite Gian Piero Gasperini’s interest in Sancho, Roma reportedly don’t have the funds available to pay his wages. Roma would need to move on some of their unwanted players first, but Inter Milan have also been mooted as suitors in Italian reports.",
      "Besiktas are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was in charge of United when Sancho was signed for £73m from Dortmund back in 2021 The move did not work out, with Sancho returning just 12 goals and six assists in 83 matches for the club. Sancho did better on loan with Chelsea, with five goals and 10 assists in 41 games last season.",
      "He helped the Blues win the Conference League but the club surprisingly opted against signing him permanently. Sancho did not go on United’s pre-season tour of the United States and is now waiting patiently for a new club to come forward ahead of the deadline on September 1.",

Rashford, 27, joined Barca last month on a season-long loan but the England international still isn't officially part of Hansi Flick's squad for La Liga matches.",
      "That's alongside fellow new signings Joan Garcia and Roony Bardghji as well as Wojciech Szczesny and Gerard Martin. This is due to Barcelona still having issues registering new players within La Liga's salary cap.",
      "With just three days to go until Barca begin their league campaign away to Mallorca, they've got a race against the clock. But Tobido's permanent move to West Ham has been boost.",
      "The French defender spent last season with the Premier League club on loan from French side Nice before a deal worth €40million (£34m) was completed this July. Thanks to inserting a sell-on clause when they sold him to Nice, Barcelona recouped €8m (£6.9m).",
      "That was a handy injection of cash for the La Liga champions, who could earn a further sum through the sale of Real Betis winger Ez Abde. Barca have a sell-on clause which, if Roma pay the reported €20m (£17.2m), would see them bank €4m (£3.4m).",
      "Todibo's journey, however, could've been very different. United were interested in signing the 25-year-old last summer, only for UEFA to block the transfer.",
      "That was because Red Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe also owns a majority stake in Nice and due to both teams being in the 2024-25 Europa League, Ratcliffe had to place the Ligue 1 outfit into a blind trust to avoid flouting UEFA's multi-club ownership rules.",
      "European football's governing body also prevented the two clubs from trading players, infuriating Ratcliffe. During an interview with Bloomberg, the INEOS chairman hit out at UEFA chiefs and referenced indirectly Todibo's situation.",

      "The Portuguese icon didn't care how his team won however - and that easy-going style had a huge effect on the England forward. Rashford, now on a season-long loan at Barcelona, was speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest is Football podcast.",
      "Asked by Lineker which coaches at United had the biggest influence on him, Rashford name-checked Louis Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Rashford delved into what made all three different and how it was Mourinho, who managed the club from 2016 to 2018, and his unique approach that surprised him the most.",
      "\"Yeah, they're [all three coaches] different, but [that's] because we've had so many different managers,\" Rashford said, referring to the ten managers United have had since 2013.",
      "\"It's so hard, It's impossible for me to compare the managers, but when you're a developing player, like at a young age, you learn stuff that you've never... no one's ever taught you that before.",
      "\"So like up until Jose, I'd never had a manager that was so fixated on winning before Jose. Van Gaal wasn't fixated on winning... he was fixated on winning, but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose don't care. Do you know what I mean?",
      "\"As long as you win, of course, if you could choose, he'd want you to play well. But if you win, you win. You move on to the next game.\"",

In the beginning, it was confusing for me because all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style of, like winning a certain way. So in the beginning, I was angry all the time, like we've not played well today, we've won.",
      "\"But because we've won and he's a manager that is just a winner, he doesn't bring up the points that you know was missing from that last game because we've won. But when we lose, he brings up the points then. But after like six months, I just learned to respect it and then I started to reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",

However, several targets, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Sesko, had been considered before settling on Gyokeres, who himself turned down interest from United.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko will now spearhead Ruben Amorim's attack for the forthcoming Premier League season. Last year, during the Euros, Postecoglou commented on the marksman ahead of Slovenia's group stage match against England, offering an insightful and rather comical perspective on the failed Arsenal move.",
      "\"I think a big club would have looked at him this year, and it's a smart move for him to stay there for another year,\" Postecoglou said while providing analysis for ITV during Euro 2024.",
      "\"I think there's still some development in him, but really good attributes for a striker position, for sure,\" he added, referring to the forward who had just signed a new contract with RB Leipzig to ward off potential suitors.",
      "ITV presenter Mark Pougatch then asked the Australian: \"Is that the Tottenham manager saying it's a smart move not to go to Arsenal?\"",
      "Postecoglou delivered a cheeky response as he declared: \"No comment.\" This sparked laughter from everyone in the ITV studio, including Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Roy Keane.",
      "Reports emerged last summer that Arsenal were poised to trigger Sesko's £55m release clause, but their interest quickly faded after the striker signed his fresh contract, reports Football London.",
      "Similar rumours surfaced again in January and during this summer's transfer window, but with a higher price tag attached, their chase swiftly ended, and Gyokeres was secured instead.",
      "The Red Devils then pounced to land themselves a striker, confirming Sesko's arrival in a deal worth £74m on Saturday and presenting him to supporters ahead of a pre-season clash with Fiorentina.",
      "Sesko was delighted when questioned about why he chose United over other potential destinations, including Arsenal and Newcastle United, who tabled a more generous offer for him this summer.",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" declared Sesko. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "\"I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford believes Manchester United have found themselves \"in no man's land\" after chopping and changing manager several times in recent years. Ruben Amorim is now at the helm, and the Portuguese is gearing up for his first full season in charge.",
      "That season will begin without Rashford at Old Trafford. The England international has moved to Barcelona on loan, and could end up in Catalunya permanently if things go well. While his own focus is on the task at hand in La Liga, he has lamented the changes at Old Trafford which have brought United to this point.",
      "“People say that we’ve been in a transition for years but to be in a transition you have to start it. The actual transition hasn’t started yet,\" Rashford told The Rest is Football Podcast. “When Liverpool went through this, they got [Jurgen] Klopp and stuck with him. They didn’t win in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with [Manchester] City and winning the biggest trophies.",
      "“To start a transition you have to make a plan and stick to it. This is where I speak about being realistic about what your situation is. We’ve had that many different managers, ideas and strategies in order to win that you end up in no man’s land.”",
      "Liverpool reached the Europa League final in Klopp's first season, losing to Sevilla. United did the same in Amorim's first campaign, but it remains to be seen whether the club are as patient as their rivals.",
      "Klopp had been for Anfield for more than two-and-a-half years before reaching the Champions League final, and three-and-a-half before winning a trophy. Since Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford in 2013, no manager has lasted three years in the role there.",
      "\"Show me a successful team that just adapts,\" Rashford said, reflecting on the Ferguson era and what has followed. \"When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team – the whole academy set up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?",
      "\"You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time – they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been… we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.\"",
      "Certainly, signing players to fit a manager's system is what United have done this summer too, as they prepare to kick off the new season against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both been signed to operate as the twin No.10s in the 3-4-2-1 formation to which Amorim is wedded, while £74m has been splashed out on Benjamin Sesko to be the club's new No.9. Combined it is a £200m outlay to give Amorim the attack he wants after muddling through last term with misfiring pair Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee sharing striking duties.",
      "With Diego Leon adding defensive depth and the potential for more additions before the window closes, Amorim believes a selection headache can only be a good thing.",
      "\"It is supposed to be like that, not like last season that we have to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch,\" he said after Saturday's friendly against Fiorentina. \"This is the normal thing so I need to think and they [the players] need to fight during the week, so they can change my mind, I have an idea but they will change my mind during the week.",
      "\"It is going to be tough because we try to arrange a full week of training, so we will have two really strong sessions with time to work and then we are going to break a little bit and then two days to really think about the strategy for the game and we will be ready.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to forget about signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin and put their faith in wonderkid Chido Obi. Calvert-Lewin, 28, is currently without a club after his contract with Everton expired in June.",
      "The striker has been linked with a free transfer to Old Trafford as well as Newcastle and Leeds, with aspirations to rediscover his best form and play for England at the World Cup next summer. United have, of course, already signed a new striker during the summer transfer window, winning the race for RB Leipzig hotshot Benjamin Sesko in a £74million deal.",
      "But unlike Calvert-Lewin, Sesko has no Premier League experience and it's been speculated that the Red Devils are considering making the ex-Everton star a contract offer. It's safe to say that Ferdinand would be against the move, as he wants to see 17-year-old Obi given minutes instead.",
      "When it was put to the former United defender that Calvert-Lewin could be a target for the Red Devils, Ferdinand replied on his YouTube channel: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin? What are you chatting about, bruv?",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit. No. Why would we bring him in to this club? This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there.",
      "\"Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit. Sign Calvert-Lewin? On what grounds? No, I'm sorry, I disagree massively, I disagree massively. What message does that send to the rest of the Premier League or more importantly to your squad?\"",
      "Obi was given his debut by United boss Ruben Amorim in February and made five further appearances before the end of last season. The Dane rose to prominence after scoring an incredible 32 goals in just 18 games for Arsenal's under-18 side before joining the Red Devils for a nominal fee last year.",
      "Denmark manager Brian Riemer recently labelled Obi 'insanely exciting', telling Viaplay, as quoted by Tipsbladet: \"He is in a place now where it is insanely exciting, but he has to make his breakthrough. That is the next step he has to focus on: breaking through at Manchester United. And from there he is a player who would be extremely interesting.\"",
      "Ferdinand's comments come as United prepare to sell Rasmus Hojlund to AC Milan. Hojlund has been shoved down the pecking order by the arrival of Sesko, having endured two difficult seasons with the Red Devils following his £72m move from Atalanta.",
      "The deal would be worth around £40m, potentially funding United's business in other areas. Amorim is reportedly targeting a midfielder, with Brighton star Carlos Baleba high on his shortlist.",
      "A goalkeeper could also be signed to provide competition for Andre Onana. Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked, although Manchester City are the favourites to land his signature and are said to have agreed personal terms.",
      "In addition to Hojlund, United are willing to sell Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, who all weren't involved in the club's pre-season tour of the USA. Amorim's side begin their Premier League campaign at home to Arsenal on Sunday.",

      "Micah Richards has criticised Marcus Rashford to his face, saying he needs to get more selfish in front of goal. Manchester United forward Rashford, 27, has joined reigning La Liga champions Barcelona for the season after spending the second half of last term on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "And he's already got his account up and running under Hansi Flick after scoring and assisting in Barca's last two pre-season fixtures. Once seen as the golden child of Old Trafford, Rashford struggled for form last season, with his goals drying up before the Villa loan move. In his half-season with United, he scored seven in all competitions - two fewer than the 2023/24 campaign and a staggering 23 fewer than 2022/23.",
      "Richards pointed out what he sees as an obvious flaw in his game on The Rest Is Football podcast. \"One criticism from me in your game is I feel like you can be more selfish,\" said the former Manchester City star. \"Because you're getting into great areas, then you always want to pass! All the other players [at the] top of world football are shooting.\"",
      "Rashford agreed with Richards, but responded by suggesting his priorities aren't solely scoring goals. The 62-cap England international scored a career-high 30 goals during the 2022/23 campaign under Erik ten Hag before issues with United successor Ruben Amorim appeared to affect his performance.",
      "\"Don't get me wrong, I love scoring goals and stuff, but this is why I can't consistently be a No. 9,\" he replied. \"Because it's not natural for me to do that, so if I am doing that, I feel like I'm forcing it. And I know that I'm missing other pictures of the game.",
      "\"Like, if I was just playing freely, I'd be seeing these pictures, so there [are] a lot of times when I don't shoot because I feel like the chance of it being blocked and missing a chance for the team, rather than just for me, is pretty high. But also the striker in me is like, 'If I can get it through his legs here [laughs], there's a high chance of it going in!'\"",
      "Those comments may cause consternation with some United fans, many of whom will have seen the scoring potential in the player. Rashford soared through the club's academy playing as a striker and burst onto the senior circuit in 2016 with a reputation for his cool finishing.",
      "The player showed a willingness to help the team when shifted out to the flanks in order to create room for others to play more centrally. And his game has been modified as a result, even though he still has the capacity to play as a more regimented centre forward.",
      "That instinct was on full display when he scored his first Barcelona goal in a recent friendly against South Korean club Daegu. The forward capped the 5-0 rout by flashing a powerful drive past the goalkeeper from the penalty spot following a cut-back from ex-Man City defender Eric Garcia.",
      "He followed up by notching his first Barca assist in the Joan Gamper Trophy, another dominant 5-0 win over Italian club Como. However, that match also saw Rashford left with egg on his face after missing a wide open goal at the back post.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand was stunned by suggestions Manchester United could sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The former England international is currently without a club after his contract at Everton expired this summer.",
      "However, the centre-forward believes a move to Old Trafford is possible and recently sacked his agent so he could potentially negotiate his own move. The Red Devils recently signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million, but they may yet need a back-up striker, with Rasmus Hojlund being linked with a move to AC Milan.",
      "When he heard about the speculation linking Calvert-Lewin to a move to Ruben Amorim's side, Ferdinand was anything but convinced. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the legendary United defender was told the 28-year-old could be an option by co-host Stephen Howson, who also said the club should sign him over keeping hold of Hojlund. Baffled, Ferdinand replied: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin, what are you chatting about?\"",
      "Ferdinand also believes Amorim should put faith in 17-year-old academy graduate Chido Obi, adding: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin cannot stay fit. Why are you bringing him into this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy. You have Chido Obi just sitting there. Play him if you're going to think about five or six games. Not somebody who is older and cannot stay fit.\"",
      "With Amorim now having Sesko, alongside new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as well as the existing Joshua Zirkzee, Ferdinand believes that Obi may only be required for a few matches next season. Last season saw Calvert-Lewin sidelined for 15 matches due to injury, including every match from January 26 to May 5.",
      "He managed to net just three goals in 26 Premier League appearances for the Toffees. Back in 2019, when he was at the top of his game, United were rumoured to be considering a £50m bid for Calvert-Lewin, who has scored four times in 11 international appearances for England.",
      "Now the situation is entirely different, with the striker currently without a club. A move to United could soon be on the cards for him, as Hojlund is reportedly open to a move to AC Milan.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed out over £200m on Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko and young defender Diego Leon. They've also been courting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is thought to be valued by the Seagulls at around £100m.",
      "Calvert-Lewin could turn out to be a cost-effective solution for Amorim and his team. United's campaign kicks off with a massive showdown against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "This is followed by a challenging away game at Fulham, before welcoming newly promoted Burnley. The pressure will then ramp up even further as they head to the Etihad Stadium for the Manchester Derby, before hosting Chelsea, who have looked formidable in the summer after clinching the Club World Cup and comfortably defeating Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in pre-season.",

      "Instead of facing Tottenham in the Super Cup in his homeland tonight, the best shot-stopping goalkeeper in Europe is up for sale.",
      "And the signing of the giant Gianluigi Donnarumma by Chelsea or Manchester City would boost their Premier League title hopes or make Manchester United genuine Champions League candidates. The 6ft 5in stopper, with the wingspan of a 747, will have that size of impact at his next club.",
      "The Italian captain - who announced he will be leaving PSG on Tuesday - first tormented English fans by saving spot kicks from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka in the Euro 2020 final penalty shootout.",
      "And the former Milan keeper, still only 26, caused heartbreak for Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal fans as he inspired Paris Saint-Germain to their first Champions League trophy.",
      "But only 73 days after the French club’s triumph over Inter Milan - and only five days after he was the only goalkeeper named in the Ballon D’Or shortlist - Donnarumma’s career at PSG is over in ruthless fashion.",
      "While the Champions League winners flew to Udine to face the Europa Cup winners yesterday, the Italy goalkeeper trained alone at the back at the Campus PSG while the club awaits offers for his signature.",
      "Last season’s all-action hero, popular with his fellow players and fans, will not play for the Qatari-owned club again. At least Marie Antoinette had a trial before she was guillotined in Paris.",
      "Donnarumma is out of contract next summer and year-long negotiations to agree a new deal have now stopped. He signed on a free transfer from Milan in 2021 on a gross salary of €10m (£8.64m). After tax breaks and bonuses, his current net annual salary has been £6.5m.",
      "PSG are now offering players lower basic wages with more performance-related bonuses and Donarumma refused the effective pay cut despite his desire to remain in the City of Light.",
      "There was a similar standoff with Kylian Mbappe two summers ago when he refused to sign a new deal and he was excluded from a summer tour to Asia. He was reintegrated back into the group after giving up millions of Euros in bonuses and then used less after Christmas when it was clear he was still leaving for Real Madrid.",
      "This time PSG have already signed Donnarumma’s replacement. Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year Lucas Chevalier joined this weekend in a €55m deal from Lille, the former club of PSG director of football Luis Campos. And the 23-year-old was bought with the backing of Luis Enrique and guaranteed he will be No.1.",
      "The PSG announcement welcoming the signing of Chevalier claimed he is: “Comfortable on his line, in one-on-one situations, and in the air, he also has excellent distribution skills”.",
      "It was interpreted by the Italian media and Donnarumma’s camp as a dig at the Azzurri keeper’s ability with his feet. Former Milan keeper Christian Abbiati told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"There's something crazy about all this. I would say he won more than half the Champions League for them. And yet, from what I hear, it seems he's bad with his feet.",
      "\"We can say that there are many players better with their feet than him, but from there to replacing a goalkeeper who has put a Champions League title in your trophy cabinet! In Europe he's made unbelievable saves, saves that few would have been capable of making.",

      "However Amorim has made it clear he would like a new midfielder with Brighton's Carlos Baleba continuing to be linked with a move to Manchester. He's excelled at the Amex but, given the fee the Seagulls would demand, there's an acceptance that any deal could prove challenging.",
      "PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma is another player who could be on the move with the Parisians leaving him out of their squad for this week's European Super Cup. PSG are open to his exit with United among those keen. Here's the latest news lines from the Red Devils.",
      "Manchester United supporters group The 1958 has pulled the plug on a planned protest. The group had planned to march against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership ahead of United's opening Premier League game, against Arsenal. Their decision comes just days after Sesko joined the club. The striker signing in a deal worth up to £74m.",
      "In early August, The 1958 shared plans for a protest while claiming \"shiny new signings\" shouldn't distract from minority owner Ratcliffe's involvement. However, following a mixed response to the announcement, the group then put the plans to its membership.",
      "While the majority of those surveyed agreed Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS should be judged on what they have delivered, some 68 percent felt they deserved more time to show what they can do. In announcing the postponement of the march, The 1958 published a breakdown of the voting.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has put Premier League sides on red alert after announcing his departure from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Donnarumma has been told he doesn't have a future at PSG by manager Luis Enrique and has said goodbye in a fiery statement on Instagram. \"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” he said. \"I am disappointed and disheartened.”",
      "Earlier in the day, Enrique had confirmed that Donnarumma had been dropped from the squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham on Wednesday night. “Donnarumma is out of the squad as it’s my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible,\" said Enrique.",
      "“I want a different kind of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Gigio is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. The life of a top-level footballer, and the same goes for us coaches, is this: it wasn’t an easy decision but I take full responsibility for it.”",
      "Donnarumma is still only 26 years old and, as a European champion with Italy in 2021 and a Champions League winner with PSG in May, the goalkeeper shouldn’t be short of suitors.",
      "The most recent noises have been coming out of the Etihad, where Pep Guardiola is said to have a soft spot for Donnarumma. There has been a lot of movement in the goalkeeping department at City this summer, with rumours of a possible departure for Ederson to Galatasaray followed by the club re-signing James Trafford for £31m from Burnley.",
      "Late on Tuesday night came news, via L’Equipe, that Donnarumma had agreed personal terms with City. The Italy international is understood to be very keen on a move to City, who will now have to negotiate a fee with PSG.",
      "By making their desire to offload Donnarumma public and promote new keeper Lucas Chevalier, PSG have backed themselves into a corner, yet reportedly value him at £43million.",
      "Donnarumma’s contract expires in less than a year so City will surely try to negotiate that fee downwards. His arrival would surely mean the end to Ederson’s eight-year stay at the club and would mean Trafford once again taking a backseat at his boyhood club.",
      "Question marks over the form of Andre Onana at United have been a constant almost ever since his arrival from Ajax – and things came to a head last season. Ruben Amorim was forced to take Onana out of the firing line after a mistake-filled performance against Lyon in the Europa League, but his replacement Altay Bayindir was no better.",
      "United reportedly contacted Aston Villa to enquire about the availability of Emi Martinez earlier this summer, while they have also been linked with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Donnarumma has always appeared to be an ambitious target, given United’s lack of European football and 15th-placed finish last season. The club have distanced themselves from a move for him, which would seem unlikely anyway.",
      "One problem is United’s lack of available funds. Donnarumma fell out with PSG after demanding a bumper new contract and United would need to offload some of their unwanted players before adding to their £200m summer spending spree. Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are their most valuable assets in that regard.",
      "Robert Sanchez has never convinced as Chelsea goalkeeper, who made an attempt to sign Mike Maignan earlier this summer. The Blues have sold Djordje Petrovic to Bournemouth for £25m, sent Kepa Arrizabalaga to Arsenal for £5m and let Marcus Bettinelli go to City.",
      "They still have Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders on their books, with the latter highly-rated and currently on loan at Strasbourg for the season. Chelsea are reportedly content with their options – and the move for Maignan was an opportunistic one, rather than a planned one.",
      "But the chance to sign Donnarumma, who would clearly be an upgrade on the error-prone Sanchez, might change their minds. Sanchez improved at the end of last season and fits Enzo Maresca’s ethos of playing out from the back, yet will always have a blunder in him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has confirmed he will leave the club this summer. However, potential suitors Manchester United are steering themselves away from the Italian, who was never overly keen on joining them anyway.",
      "Donnarumma started for PSG as they won last season's Champions League and reached the final of the Club World Cup. His PSG career is now over though, with Lucas Chevalier joining from Lille and Donnarumma announcing his departure on Tuesday night.",
      "PSG have named their squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham Hotspur, who beat United in the Europa League final in May and Donnarumma isn't in it. Chevalier has been joined by Matvey Safonov and Renato Marin, with last season's first choice keeper nowhere to be seen.",
      "His absence has prompted increased talk of a Premier League switch, with United, Manchester City and Chelsea strongly linked with him, with City said the be front-runners according to reports in France.",
      "United, meanwhile, are distancing themselves from reports of their interest. Ruben Amorim's side have shown ambition by spending £200m on a flurry of attacking talent, but aren't in Europe this season, something which is a key requirement of Donnarummma's.",
      "Chelsea had also been linked with Donnarumma, but the Blues are believed to be happy with current keepers Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Belgian youngster Mike Penders is also highly regarded in West London, and is spending the current season on loan at Strasbourg.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Galatasaray and Bayern Munich are among the other clubs able to match the Italian's wage demands. Both clubs are involved in the Champions League, with Gala already flexing their muscles with big contracts for Victor Osimhen and Leroy Sane.",
      "If United did move for Donnarumma, it would likely mean an exit for one of Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir. Turkish keeper Bayindir has played regularly in pre-season as Onana works his way back to full fitness, but the Cameroon international may be ready to return against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "\"For us, it doesn't matter which team we will play,\" Bayindir told club media after helping United beat Fiorentina on penalties on Saturday. \"Every game is important in the Premier League. This week, we will work for Arsenal, and then from the Arsenal game, step by step for the next game, we will prepare ourselves.\"",
      "United's opponents have added a new keeper themselves this summer, though he is unlikely to start on Sunday. Spanish international Kepa Arrizabalaga joined in a cut-price move from Chelsea, but remains second choice behind David Raya.",
      "The Sunday clash will also allow Viktor Gyokeres to face off against his former manager Ruben Amorim. A reunion for the ex-Sporting pair had looked possible early in the window, but Gyokeres instead moved to North London in a £64m deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has claimed Manchester United can finish in the top six if their three new strikers notch 40 goals - and they get another goalkeeper to keep them out at the other end.",
      "Ruben Amorin’s side finished 15th last season after scoring only 44 goals in Premier League games. But the £73.7m signing of Slovene Benjamin Seska has taken their summer spending on strikers to over £200m following the arrival of Bryan Mbeumbo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "And former Reds defender Neville believes there will have to be an improvement on the last torrid campaign. “I think they'll be looking at Champions League, I think that'll be the ambition,” he said. “I think we've gone past the point now where we say Manchester United have to win the league, I think that's unrealistic.",
      "“I think top six would be healthy, I think that my feeling is probably between seventh, eighth is where I'm looking at it now, but I think they could, without Europe, they could get into the top six if they have a good run, and those players settling up front, which I'm actually quite happy about the players they've signed up front.",
      "“I didn't think they had the £200 million to spend. If you said to me after that Tottenham game in the Europa League that Manchester United would have a forward line of those three that they've signed, I'd have snapped your hand off. I like the profile of those players, whether they settle in now is obviously the big question.",
      "\"Two of them are proven Premier League players, obviously they've got to step up a level, Sesko's young, he's got potential. He's young, can he get off to a good start? That's important for him.",
      "“Can they embed themselves at United? Can they get the probably 35-40 goals which would be par for those three players? If they can get 40 goals, United's goals last season was terrible, they've got a good chance of getting into that top six, but they've got to settle those three players, and we can't take that for granted anymore at United. If they get a goalkeeper, I think that they could get into the top six, but a lot of things have to go on.”",
      "Manchester United conceded 54 Premier League goals to finish the season with a goal difference of -10. Paris-Saint Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is available for £30m - and big wages - as an upgrade from Andre Onana.",
      "Amorin will also have more time to work with his players without European football. Antonio Conte took Chelsea from 10th to champions in his first season in 2016-17.",
      "“I think it'll help, it has to help, because there's basically more training time, less pressure on the players, less injuries, it means that the best players can play more often in the league, and not have those demands of a Thursday night game,” Neville said. “But I think we've got to start the season well, there were some tough fixtures early on.”",
      "“It's a big game, we're out for Arsenal,” he said. “I think there's going to be that much pressure on Arsenal, just because we're in year five now, I think it's year six, and it just feels like right from the start everyone's eyes are on them. so I don't think it's a great game actually for Arsenal, to kick off the season as well, because of the situation that they're in, where it just feels like all eyes are on them from the very start.",
      "“I'm not saying it's Premier League or bust, that type of thing, because I actually think Mikel Artel has done a brilliant job, and to be second, year after year, people sort of sneer at him, Arsenal finish second again, but there's a lot of good clubs in this, so to second every year is not a mean feat.",
      "“I think it would be good for them to get some sort of trophy. I think they had a good result in their last pre-season match but I think the one before that, they lost at home, and there was a few murmurs in the crowd. It's not just people outside, people in the stadium are worried. It's like: ‘This has to happen now’.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has been bombarded by messages from Besiktas fans on social media after the Turkish side emerged as an escape route for the Manchester United reject.",
      "Sancho has been exiled at United, where Ruben Amorim has placed him and other unwanted players in a so-called ‘bomb squad’. He, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been told to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford by finding a new club.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has been linked with moves to Juventus, Fenerbahce and Borussia Dortmund, but a move is yet to materialise. His £300,000-a-week wages at United, where he is under contract until June 2026, have proven problematic in the market.",
      "However, speculation has ramped up once more with the news that both Roma and Besiktas are actively pursuing a deal for Sancho. New Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini is keen on signing him, while former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants a reunion with him in Istanbul.",
      "Besiktas has something that Roma doesn’t: an army of online supporters out to persuade Sancho to move to Turkey. His latest Instagram post, which shows photos of him relaxing on holiday has racked up over 5million comments, the vast majority of which simply read: “Come to Besiktas”.",
      "And the club’s president Serdal Adali is willing to follow through with the fans’ wishes. “Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "“Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but the club turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. He then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, only for those deals to collapse and former United striker Teddy Sheringham is worried his career is on the downslide.",
      "“Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club ever again. He will probably tell you that he can and he will but not for me,” Sheringham told Snabbare. “I see that he's burned his bridges with the manager. He’s not even got a place in the changing room.",
      "“Maybe if he’d be given another chance he could work for what Amorim wants but I know from experience once you've gone down that path of being unhappy and wanting out that it's very hard to turn it around with the manager, with the supporters, with the other players.",
      "“You've got to show an unbelievable mental desire to turn that around. It can be done, and I know he's a talented lad, but I would be very, very surprised if that was the case now.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Garnacho swiftly deleted the Instagram story before posting it again without the appearance of the vape pen, which was claimed to belong to someone else.",

      "While the youngster's talent is evident, Amorim hinted at the reasons he thinks the forward is open to a move away from Manchester. Speaking earlier this summer, the Portuguese boss said: \"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy. But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, plenty more transfer activity is expected at Manchester United.",
      "They still need to try and offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony, a handful of youngsters in need of loan moves and bring in a midfielder. The prospect of a goalkeeper also being drafted in is still possible.",
      "After experiencing their worst season in 51 years last term, United have had little choice but to splash the cash this summer. They have rightfully prioritised attacking signings, bringing in three new faces in the hope of increasing their attacking output.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and bringing in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford prior to the season tour of the United States, United completed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last weekend, bringing an end to their search for a striker.",
      "After recording a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had to make the addition of a proven goalscorer their priority this summer. Sesko has arrived on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "As a result of Sesko's arrival at Old Trafford, Rasmus Hojlund is looking increasingly likely to depart ahead of the window closing on September 1. It is understood he is open to joining AC Milan, who are in the process of rebuilding their squad under head coach Massimiliano Allegri.",
      "Hojlund started just two of United's five pre-season friendlies and watched attacking-midfielders Cunha and Mason Mount lead the line in his absence against Everton and Fiorentina. That was almost certainly Ruben Amorim's way of telling him he doesn't feature in his plans.",
      "Amid the increasing likelihood of Hojlund departing, United have been credited with interest in former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is still a free agent after leaving the Toffees at the end of last season. It was reported by talkSPORT on Monday that United are one of three Premier League clubs he has 'held talks' with him.",
      "Reports linking him with a move to Old Trafford have baffled former United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit,\" said the former United centre-back on his YouTube channel. \"No. Why would we bring him in to this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there. Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit.\"",
      "Not only is Ferdinand right that United should steer clear of Calvert-Lewin, who scored just three Premier League goals last season, but he is also right that the club should prioritise the development of Chido Obi.",
      "Of course, the Danish youth international is only 17 and is still learning his trade, but he has an enormous amount of potential United should be trying to unleash instead of signing a 28-year-old that has scored just 17 Premier League goals in the last four seasons.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has only made it into double figures twice in the Premier League in his career, last doing so in 2020/21, scoring 16 goals under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sesko will be their main man at the tip United's attack this season and Obi will be hungry to be the support act, providing competition and help from the bench. He made eight appearances last season and will only get better the more game time he earns.",
      "United's history is built on promoting from within and their academy has been a consistent beacon of light throughout the recent struggles at first-team level. Obi has demonstrated he is an instinctive striker, possessing traits that cannot always be taught on the training ground.",
      "United supporters love nothing more than seeing an academy graduate make their mark in the first-team and there is every chance Obi will be able to do that in good time.",
      "Additionally, with no European football to come this season, United do not have as many fixtures to look forward to, meaning rotation will not be as heavy as in previous seasons. That could allow Obi to be eased in slower, helping him and United in the process.",
      "Obi is a much more appealing option than Calvert-Lewin as a secondary striker right now.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville has admitted he would have \"snapped your hand off\" at the end of last season for the forward line the club has assembled this summer.",
      "After finishing with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League last season, United had no choice but to prioritise strengthening their attacking options in this summer's transfer window.",
      "After swooping for Wolves ace Matheus Cunha and Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo ahead of the pre-season tour of the United States, United completed their attacking overhaul with the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig last weekend.",
      "The 22-year-old, who scored 21 goals in all competitions for the German club last season, is deemed as the final piece in the jigsaw for the Reds, offering them the presence of a new out-and-out striker at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Despite signing a young striker from abroad for the second time in three years, United are confident Sesko will fulfil his potential at Old Trafford. There is also plenty of optimism that he will be benefit from being joined in attack by Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 35 Premier League goals between them last season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Admitting he has been surprised by how much money United have had available to them this summer, Neville is really pleased with how United's recruitment has unfolded ahead of the start of the new campaign this weekend.",
      "\"I didn't think they had £200 million to spend. So the fact they've signed those three players is good.",
      "\"I like the profile of those players, whether they settle in now is obviously the big question. Two of them are proven Premier League players, although they've got to step up a level.",
      "\"Mbeumo is quite solid, he's robust, he's played at Premier League level. He and Cunha know the Premier League, they've been to all the grounds, there's no shocks for them.",
      "\"And Sesko up front. He's young, he's got potential but can he get off to a good start? That's important for him.\"",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The countdown to the start of the new Premier League season is almost over.",
      "Less than 48 hours after Liverpool and Bournemouth open the 2025/26 campaign at Anfield on Friday night, Manchester United and Arsenal will take centre stage at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The visit of the Londoners will mark the beginning of Ruben Amorim's first full season as United head coach, and there is an upbeat mood surrounding the club heading into their season opener.",
      "A successful summer transfer window, which has seen four new arrivals, and a positive pre-season campaign means United supporters will be arriving at Old Trafford on confident last season's woes will be banished.",
      "But what could Amorim's matchday squad for the season opener look like?",
      "If Onana wins his fitness battle and gets the green light to start, it will be interesting to see the landscape of the back three he is tasked with marshalling. Leny Yoro is a guaranteed starter after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less certainty about who will join him in defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are competing to start in the middle of the back three and Ayden Heaven is rivalling Luke Shaw to start as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "All four players will believe they are worthy of starting berths, leaving Amorim with a selection dilemma to solve. There is no obvious answer, but De Ligt and Shaw could get the nod after making three starts each during the summer.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are shoo-ins to occupy the two wing-back positions. The latter came on in leaps and bounds during pre-season, particularly during the tour of the United States, while Amad started all five warm up matches.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to occupy one of the two midfield positions. The United captain has regularly flexed his muscles in the engine room and is a guaranteed starter.",
      "However, there is an ongoing debate about who should partner the Portuguese international. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the contenders and they all got opportunities to prove their worth during pre-season.",
      "In an ideal world, United will bring in a new midfielder before the transfer window slams shut, but that mission is unlikely to be fulfilled ahead of Sunday's game. It means Ugarte, amid his defensive profile, is the most logical partner for Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo will believe he is worthy of a starting berth, but he is a forward-thinking player, meaning the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield would risk leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Cunha, who scored 17 goals for Wolves last season, should start as the left-sided No.10. Bryan Mbeumo is the obvious pick to fill the other No.10 spot.",
      "Despite only featuring twice in pre-season due to a lack of match sharpness, Mbeumo impressed against both Everton and Fiorentina. He linked up really well with Amad and should be awarded his competitive debut for United from the start.",
      "Supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko should come straight into the team and lead the attack. He arrived from RB Leipzig last weekend to provide the final piece in the attacking jigsaw.",
      "As far as the bench is concerned, Amorim has a competitive squad at his disposal, meaning he will have options to turn to. Tom Heaton had a better pre-season than Altay Bayindir and should be promoted to second-choice in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can come from Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven. Mainoo and Casemiro can offer midfield cover and Mason Mount will be able to offer support to Cunha and Mbeumo in the No.10 position.",
      "Unless an exit materialises beforehand, Hojlund should make the bench. Chido Obi should also make the matchday squad against his former club.",
      "United starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "United substitutes: Heaton, Dalot, Maguire, Heaven, Mainoo, Casemiro, Mount, Hojlund, Obi.",

      "Alongside Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and previously Marcus Rashford, who joined Barcelona on loan last month, Antony has been relegated to the 'bomb squad' and is expected to leave United before the transfer window shuts on September 1.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in 26 appearances, and they are keen to re-sign him before the deadline. However, sporting director Manu Fajardo confirmed earlier this week they will only be able to sign him for a second time if a deal doesn't threaten their financial situation.",
      "It is expected Antony's only hope of rejoining the La Liga outfit is via a season-long loan deal. Now, fellow Brazilian Natan has hinted the United winger is expecting to return to the club.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to your dedicated Manchester United transfers blog on Wednesday, August 13.",
      "Heading into the final few weeks of the summer transfer window, United remain active and open to pursuing new opportunities. One of the latest names linked is Carlos Baleba of Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "The young midfielder is considered one of the most highly rated prospects in European football, with a sky-high ceiling. So far, the club have added Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side wrapped up their pre-season campaign over the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, going on to win the match in a penalty shootout. Now, the focus shifts to the start of the Premier League season and Sunday afternoon's clash with Arsenal.",
      "However, despite the significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings, further business could still be on the cards - provided United are able to sanction one or two departures. As for potential outgoings, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho are all effectively available for transfer.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "Betis centre-back Natan has claimed winger Antony is 'waiting' to seal a return to the Spanish club.",
      "It is expected Antony's only hope of rejoining the La Liga outfit is via a season-long loan deal. Now, fellow Brazilian Natan has hinted the United winger is expecting to return to the club.",
      "\"Hopefully he can come back and be with us for another year or two,\" Natan told El Chiringuito, as quoted by Football Espana. \"Yes, he's waiting and we're all waiting.",
      "\"I think it's not just me, all the Betis. I hope he comes. Let's hope, I have hope.\"",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein claims Leeds United have reached an agreement in principle to sign Calvert-Lewin amid links to Man United.",
      "The 28-year-old became a free agent after his Everton contract expired in June. A medical for the striker at Leeds' training ground, Thorp Arch, is said to be scheduled 'imminently.'",
      "Marcus Rashford believes Man United have never properly adapted after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Speaking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has been… we’re hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but it’s reactionary.",
      "\"If your directions are always changing, you can’t expect to win the league. You might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you have a good coach, good players and you have match winners in your team, you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.",
      "\"Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect? People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It’s like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Referencing the early struggles Jurgen Klopp endured as Liverpool manager, Rashford added: \"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him. They didn’t win anything in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with City and winning the biggest trophies, they did not win anything at the beginning. To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it.",
      "\"This is where I want to speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we’ve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win, you end up in the middle of them, you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Manchester City have not denied interest in Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Donnarumma - but their preference is to keep Ederson.",
      "The Brazilian has been No.1 at the club for the past eight years and the intention is to make that nine. Tuesday saw an avalanche of media reports though regarding both Ederson and Donnarumma. There have been claims that Galatasaray are closing in on a deal for the former while City have agreed terms with the latter, whose time at PSG is over.",
      "A move for Donnarumma looks certain if Ederson leaves, and City will reluctantly let him leave if they get the right offer - just as they will Savinho amid Tottenham interest. However, club sources say that there is currently nothing on the table for Ederson from other clubs and they would like to keep it that way.",
      "The speculation adds to the uncertainty around City heading into the new season. Pep Guardiola said last week that he was not expecting any new arrivals in the remaining weeks of the transfer window, but City would be forced into action by movement around Ederson.",
      "More here.",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Man United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club. I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea. \"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high. Like Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season.",
      "He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive. With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes report Man United have submitted an offer of around €80million (£69m) for Lopez. The bid is said to be hard for the Catalan club to ignore.",
      "Barca, who are dealing with ongoing financial challenges, recognise the viability of the offer and its potential benefits for the transfer.",
      "Last week, Lopez was asked about the transfer speculation, saying: \"I want to stay here - it’s my dream, and I will stay. I’m happy to help the team.",
      "\"A lot has been said, but I’m going to keep defending these colors and working harder than anyone. The fans can relax.\"",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing Man United winger Antony before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Antony is expected to leave the club ahead of the window closing on September 1. Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "\"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo, as quoted by AS. \"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here.",
      "\"If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "United need to sell the Brazilian for £32.58million this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR). He has two years left on his deal at Old Trafford.",
      "Hull City are reportedly hopeful of securing a season-long loan deal for Toby Collyer.",
      "According to our colleagues at Hull Live, Hull view Toby Collyer as a player with significant potential and see him as a strong candidate for the number six role.",
      "The Tigers are believed to have been in talks with Man United for several weeks and are confident they’re leading the race to sign the 21-year-old, ahead of other Championship sides - including Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "They are said to be 'quietly confident' of completing a deal for Collyer ahead of Oxford United's visit to the MKM Stadium on Sunday, although the move is not yet finalised. The club is also still awaiting the outcome of their appeal against a three-window fee restriction ban.",
      "Sancho has turned down a transfer offer to leave Man United.",
      "The winger, who has reportedly held talks with several Serie A clubs, is said to have received another offer this week from Turkish side Besiktas.",
      "Besiktas president Serdal Adali said: \"Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too. What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "\"Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.\"",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano reports that Sancho has rejected the chance to reunite with former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in Turkey.",
      "The 25-year-old is believed to be holding out for a move to Italy and has therefore turned down Besiktas’ advances. That stance, however, could change if he is still searching for a new club as the transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Man United have reportedly held talks to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin following the expiration of his contract at Everton at the end of June.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Calvert-Lewin has parted ways with his agent as he continues his search for a new club, and he has signaled openness to a potential move to United.",
      "In addition to discussions with the Reds, Newcastle United and Leeds United are also said to have engaged in talks regarding a possible transfer. Meanwhile, Sunderland recently made an ambitious attempt to secure the English striker's signature.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, contact with Brighton for the midfielder has continued from Manchester United's side.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel last night, he said: \"Contacts continue for Carlos Baleba. Today, Man United spoke again to the agents of the player. They are prepared to try to understand how much Brighton want.",
      "\"So this week, I expect Manchester United to try to understand the situation directly with Brighton, and let’s see what’s going to happen there. But Baleba remains a topic at United. They are still not moving on another midfielder, and it means that United maintain the contacts active for Baleba and also try to understand if they can really make it happen or if it’s going to be impossible because Brighton still have no intention to reduce their price tag.\"",
      "Give Me Sport report that Man United are keeping an eye on England international, Kane.",
      "The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026 and could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56million.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad.",
      "The 26-year-old Italy international has been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique. United were one of the Premier League clubs most frequently linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper.",
      "French publication L'Equipe claims that Donnarumma had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms with the former AC Milan prodigy.",
      "We'll be keeping you updated throughout the day with the latest United news, as there are now less than three weeks until the summer transfer window closes. The countdown is also on for the Reds' Premier League opener against Arsenal!",
      "So, grab yourself a brew - let's get started, shall we?",
      "Join us tomorrow for all the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours.",
      "See you then!",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer, has issued a statement on his future after being left out of Luis Enrique’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "The Italy international has one year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes and has been tipped to leave the club this summer.",
      "Donnarumma’s future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own.",
      "Read what he had to say here.",
      "Manchester United remain confident of selling Rasmus Hojlund before the summer transfer window closes, writes James Quinlan.",
      "A hint to what life could be like at Old Trafford for Hojlund following those three signings came last Saturday too, when he was an unused substitute in 1-1 friendly draw with Fiorentina.",
      "The club have already judged around £30m to be a fair market value for a striker who last season scored only four Premier League goals in 32 outings.",
      "However, the CIES Football Observatory has freshly updated its estimated transfer values and would suggest United are severely underestimating themselves and their Danish international.",

      "The Reds drew 1-1 with the Serie A outfit at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon after Simon Sohm's eighth-minute opener was cancelled out by a Robin Gosens own-goal.",
      "For De Gea, it was his first return to Old Trafford since he left United at the end of his contract in May 2023. The Spaniard spent 12 seasons with the Red Devils, making 545 appearances.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Manchester United are not actively pursuing Paris Saint-Germain outcast Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "The goalkeeper has one year remaining on his deal at the Parc des Princes and could depart for a reduced fee this summer. He has not been included in Luis Enrique's squad for their UEFA Super Cup meeting with Tottenham on Wednesday night amid ongoing speculation over his future.",
      "The Italian has been linked with a switch to the Premier League, although the Daily Mail claim United have shut down any suggestions he is a target for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Donnarumma is not a target and goalkeeper is not a priority position for the club this summer.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is in talks over a loan move to Championship side Hull City, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "The article claims initial talks have been held over a season-long loan for the 21-year-old, with the Tigers having a strong track record of devloping young talent.",
      "It has been suggested talks are at an early stage and there remains some competition from Sheffield Wednesday, but the midfielder is open to a loan switch ahead of the new campaign.",
      "Garnacho joining Chelsea on a permanent deal could help Man United fund a swoop for Baleba and, also, hand the midfielder a dream welcome gift.",
      "Baleba appears to be open to an Old Trafford switch, but it seems very likely available (or unavailable) finances will be what prevents a would-be deal. Elsewhere, United are said to want £50million to sell Garnacho, but Chelsea are not currently keen on hitting that figure.",
      "If a compromise is reached on a fee, it seems almost guaranteed that United will put those funds towards signing Baleba. If that scenario does play out, United's latest arrival could be left the perfect welcome gift by the departing Garnacho. That is because both players wore the No.17 shirt last season and Garnacho moving on would leave that free for Baleba to take.",
      "As potential alternatives, Baleba has also worn No.20 and No.35 but - after a few alterations - only the former is available at United. It certainly seems as though the No.17 would be his first-choice considering he changed to that squad number at the start of his second season at Brighton.",
      "Man United have made an unusual Rasmus Hojlund decision after launching their new third kit for the upcoming Premier League season.",
      "The smart design is likely to go down a treat with supporters as the predominantly black kit includes a yellow and blue trim. The Adidas strip was unveiled to the general public on Tuesday morning and while there was not anything overtly unusual about the launch, the Dane's involvement may raise eyebrows.",
      "MEN Sport reported this week that the striker was now open to the possibility of signing for AC Milan.",
      "Throughout the summer, Hojlund had insisted that he saw his future at Old Trafford and was not interested in looking at other challenges. However, following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko last week, that mindset has now changed.",
      "Exactly whether the deal will be permanent or on loan is unclear. If United were to allow Hojlund to leave permanently, they would be looking for a price tag in the region of £30m.",
      "Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek has closely followed Sesko’s progress over the past four years and knows exactly what the striker brings to Man United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024.",
      "\"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one. It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success]. He is the modern striker par excellence. I don't know where he will play next season, he will decide but, for now, I'll enjoy him this summer.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Manchester United were one of three clubs to make an approach for Fiorentina centre-back Comuzzo, according to Tutto Sport.",
      "The report claims that several sides have expressed interest in the young defender in recent weeks, with Bournemouth and Southampton also making moves.",
      "Fiorentina owner and president Rocco Benito Commisso is said to be a strong admirer of Comuzzo and has rejected all three approaches. The club remain firmly opposed to selling, with Commisso convinced the youngster has a very bright future.",
      "According to a report from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter Milan aim to capitalize on the ongoing fallout between Jadon Sancho and Manchester United in a bid to sign him this summer.",
      "Inter, having decided to sign a forward this month, have added Sancho, Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, and Ademola Lookman to their target list. However, with Lookman reportedly commanding a hefty price, ‘all eyes’ are now on Sancho this summer.",
      "Speaking to reports, Real Betis' sporting director Manu Fajardo has expressed his desire to sign Antony this summer.",
      "He explained:",
      "The desire on both sides, player and club, is to be together again. Every day that passes, the hope grows, but if Antony arrives, it's because he's doing so in the numbers that suit Betis.",
      "Antony requested to leave United at the start of the summer.",
      "Hurzeler maintains he has no 'fear' of losing key players, even with Baleba the latest high-profile name linked to a potential departure.",
      "\"No chance. I don’t feel fear,\" Hurzeler told the BBC. \"I’m not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, work as hard as we can.",
      "\"All the other things we can’t influence, so we really have to focus on us. For sure, we can’t spend the money like the big teams, but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I’m sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "Hurzeler continued: \"It’s not easy, but we proved last season that we are a very competitive team. Without Joao Pedro, for sure, he was an unbelievable player. But we can’t replace him with one player, we can replace him as a team. And that’s our focus.\"",
      "Former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi has questioned Hojlund's hesitation to leave Man United despite interest from AC Milan.",
      "\"We’re not talking about van Basten, nor are we talking about one of the strongest centre-forwards in Europe at the moment. He’s a decent player, nothing more,\" Sacchi told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"I understand the desire of the Rossoneri directors given that there is a shortage of strikers.",
      "\"But it has to be one that wants to come to Italy, one that doesn’t throw a tantrum. I don’t understand his choice. If Milan calls you, you pack your bags and get on the first plane to Malpensa. Milan, in the world of football, is a mystical name. I, along with all the players who are brought in, would take a tour of the trophy room so that we understand where we have come.",
      "\"Of course, Manchester United is also a legendary team. But on the one hand, there is a club, Milan, which is offering you a permanent job, and on the other hand, there is a club that is doing everything to try and sell you. What would you choose?’",
      "According to The Athletic, United's squad are beginning to rally around to try and help the Reds sign Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "It is claimed that unnamed players have contacted the midfielder to explain the set-up at United.",
      "Onana and Mbeumo both represent Cameroon with Baleba while the midfielder knows Leny Yoro from their time together at Lille.",
      "Despite Brighton's stance that Baleba is not for sale this summer, their manager Fabian Hurzeler has insisted that he is not fearful of losing their better players in the transfer window.",
      "Brighton have already lost the likes of Joao Pedro in this window.",
      "He told the Monday Night Club:",
      "We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions. That's our model, we have to accept it. I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player. Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us."

      "The Cameroonian, who played no part in United's pre-season campaign because of a hamstring injury, was guilty of committing one too many high profile mistakes last season, leading to questions being asked of his suitability to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper.",

      "\"I think Yann Sommer is a very, very experienced player and a calming presence,\" Senderos told BoyleSports, who provide Premier League odds. \"He makes the defence better because of that presence.",
      "\"I can't really judge Andre Onana in this situation, but if United were to target Yann Sommer, I'd really believe he'd add invaluable experience.",
      "\"It's about how he is as a person, how he is on the pitch. He's a great character and amazing in what he brings to a defence. We've seen it with Inter Milan and Bayern Munich the year before.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has revealed that former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho helped him become less \"angry all the time.\"",
      "Rashford, 27, has admitted he would criticise himself harshly whenever he failed to deliver a flawless performance, regardless of the result. Portuguese legend Mourinho \"didn't care\" about how his side secured victory though - and that relaxed approach profoundly influenced the English forward.",
      "Rashford, currently on a season-long loan spell at Barcelona, was talking to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football podcast. When Lineker enquired which coaches at United had the most significant impact on him, Rashford mentioned Louis Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Rashford explored what distinguished all three and explained how it was Mourinho, who led the club between 2016 and 2018, whose distinctive methods caught him off guard the most. \"Yeah, they're different, but [that's] because we've had so many different managers,\" Rashford said, referring to the 10 managers United have had since 2013.",
      "\"It's so hard, it's impossible for me to compare the managers, but when you're a developing player, like at a young age, you learn stuff that you've never... no one's ever taught you that before.",
      "\"So like up until Jose, I'd never had a manager that was so fixated on winning before. Van Gaal wasn't fixated on winning... he was fixated on winning, but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose don't care. Do you know what I mean?",
      "\"As long as you win, of course, if you could choose, he'd want you to play well. But if you win, you win. You move on to the next game.\"",
      "Explaining how Mourinho's methods proved a welcome shift for him, he continued: \"He had this attitude. In the beginning, it was confusing for me because all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style of, like winning a certain way. So in the beginning, I was angry all the time, like we've not played well today, we've won.",
      "\"But because we've won and he's a manager that is just a winner, he doesn't bring up the points that you know was missing from that last game because we've won. But when we lose, he brings up the points then. But after like six months, I just learned to respect it and then I started to reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Following months of speculation, Rashford eventually left United, the club he joined at seven years old, for Aston Villa at the beginning of the year. After netting four times under Unai Emery, he chose to move to the La Liga champions this summer.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim is now presiding over another fresh chapter at Old Trafford. His side finished 15th last campaign and suffered a costly defeat in the Europa League Final against Tottenham Hotspur. When pressed to identify what's gone awry at his former club, Rashford maintains the Red Devils have deserted the \"principles\" established by their ex-legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"When Ferguson was in charge, not only were there principles for the first team but they were for the whole academy,\" he said. \"So you could pick players from 15 years and they'd all understand the principles of playing the Manchester United way.",
      "\"Any team that has been successful over a period of time has principles that mean that any coach or player that comes in has to align to or add to the principles. At times, United were hungry to win but it was reactionary. If your direction is always changing, you can't expect to win the league.\"",

      "The forward has been part of the club for the last 20 years, witnessing the glory years of Ferguson's reign while in the academy system before breaking into the first team under Louis van Gaal. Having experienced the reigns of Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and, briefly, Amorim, Rashford believes the problems at United have been the same - a lack of transition.",

      "\"People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It’s like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Referencing the early struggles Jurgen Klopp endured as Liverpool manager, Rashford added: \"When Liverpool went through this with Klopp, they stuck with him. They didn’t win anything in the beginning.",
      "\"People only remember his final few years when he was competing with City and winning the biggest trophies, they did not win anything at the beginning. To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it.",

      "As they did on a regular basis while Rashford was at Old Trafford, United have invested a lot of money this summer. With Rashford being loaned to Barcelona and United also trying to usher Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho out of the door, Amorim has mainly focused on his attacking options.",

      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer, has issued a statement on his future after being left out of Luis Enrique’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "The Italy international has one year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes and has been tipped to leave the club this summer. PSG have already signed Lucas Chevalier from Ligue 1 rivals Lille, and the Frenchman is expected to assume the starting role for the new season.",
      "United are among several European clubs to have been linked with the 26-year-old, as doubts continue to grow over his future at PSG. However, a recent report from the Daily Mail suggests that a goalkeeper is not currently a priority for the Manchester club, and talk of interest in the PSG outcast has been played down.",
      "That said, Donnarumma’s future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own. \"To the special Paris fans,\" he wrote.",
      "\"From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain. Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success. I am disappointed and disheartened.",
      "\"I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.",
      "\"I will always carry with me the memory of all the emotions, the magical nights, and of you, who made me feel at home. To my teammates – my second family – thank you for every battle, every laugh, every moment we shared. You will always be my brothers.",
      "\"Playing for this club and living in this city has been an immense honour. Thank you, Paris.\"",

      "Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique has taken responsibility for the decision to dismiss Gianluigi Donnarumma from his squad for the UEFA Super Cup. The goalkeeper has subsequently been linked with a transfer to either Manchester City or Manchester United.",
      "Champions League winners PSG take on Tottenham Hotspur for the Super Cup in Italy on Wednesday night but have chosen to not include their first-choice goalkeeper of four years. Donnarumma's contract in the French capital expires at the end of the coming season, meaning he would become a free agent and able to depart without a transfer fee.",
      "Tension has grown over the unresolved situation and now Enrique has confirmed it is he who has taken action.",
      "\"These are difficult decisions, but I take responsibility for the choice I made. If they were easy, anyone would make them. They have to do with the profile of the goalkeeper my team needs.\"",

      "According to RMC Sport, Donnarumma is City's top pick to replace Ederson should the Brazilian opt to leave the Etihad Stadium after eight years. Turkish media have reported interest from Galatasaray.",
      "Also speaking on the topic of Donnarumma was PSG captain Marquinhos. The defender said: \"We know how football is, which is a bit difficult, especially in the transfer market.",
      "\"He was a great player for us, he deserves all the best in his life. He's a great person and a great man, he respected this club a lot, but football is like that and sometimes we can't do too much.",

      "Manchester United could be prepared to spend a record-breaking £112million on Carlos Baleba this summer, it has been claimed. Ruben Amorim's side remains in the market for a new midfielder and the Brighton man has emerged as their top target for that position.",
      "Reports claimed last week that United contacted Brighton through intermediaries to explore a potential move for Baleba. The Reds are understood to be among the several suitors and interest is building in the ex-Lille man, who has three years left on his contract at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, do not want to sell him until at least next summer. The Seagulls signed Baleba for £27m plus add-ons in August 2023 and he has since taken the Premier League by storm.",
      "While a move for Baleba might be difficult to strike unless United secure a raft of lucrative sales, an update from Foot Mercato journalist Nabil Djellit has suggested that the Reds might indeed get a deal done.",
      "Djellit said that the record for the largest transfer in history for an African player - a feat still held by Nicolas Pepe following his £72m move to Arsenal from Lille in August 2019 - will be broken by Baleba.",
      "It's added that 'they are talking about a package of £112m behind the scenes'.",
      "Should United sign Baleba for a nine-figure transfer sum, he would become their most expensive transfer ever, eclipsing Paul Pogba's blockbuster £89.3m move from Juventus in August 2016.",
      "Looking at how Baleba's move would rank in the Premier League's all-time biggest deal, he would slot into third place behind Moises Caicedo and Florian Wirtz. Caicedo left Brighton to sign for Chelsea in a £115m move two years ago, while Wirtz joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for £116m back in June.",
      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler, meanwhile, hinted that he isn't worried about speculation around Baleba's future. Speaking on the 'Monday Night Club' podcast by the BBC, the Brighton boss said: \"No chance. I don't feel fear. I'm not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can. All the other things we can't influence, so we really have to focus on us.",
      "\"For sure, we can't spend the money like the big teams but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I'm sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber spoke about Baleba's future at a pre-season fan forum last Wednesday. As quoted by the BBC, he said: \"There's always going to be interest in our players.",
      "\"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. Speculation is speculation.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent. We hope he'll be here for years to come - but its subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler has addressed his club's activity in the transfer market as Manchester United continue to be linked with Carlos Baleba.",
      "Baleba has emerged as a potential target for Ruben Amorim. The United boss completed his new-look attack force with Benjamin Sesko's £66.4m arrival and could now seek to bolster his midfield before the transfer window closes.",
      "It has, therefore, been suggested that Brighton's Cameroon international is the man they have settled on. The Athletic reports United want to sign Baleba before the window closes as they anticipate the player could be the subject of a bidding war next summer.",
      "Baleba joined the Seagulls from Lille in 2023 for £23.2m. He helped the club reach the Europa League round of 16 in 2023/24 and then last season took on a prominent role with 34 of 38 Premier League matches played. It is now claimed his next move could cost more than £100m.",
      "At the time the 21-year-old arrived to the Premier League, Brighton had just confirmed the then-British-record sale of Moises Caicedo to Chelsea for £115m. The Ecuadorian had been signed for £4.5m again just two years before.",
      "Such deals have earned the south coast club a reputation as having one of the most lucrative selling models in global football.",
      "This has continued in the summer of 2025 as Joao Pedro was allowed to move to Chelsea in a £55m deal earlier this summer. The forward scored 13 and assisted seven last term, so speaking to The Athletic, Hurzeler was asked for his thoughts on losing players of such importance.",
      "He said: \"There is always talk when a club does something special, when a club is special. We are proud of our ways of working and we are not the only club who have sold one of our best players.",
      "\"It happens to bigger teams, bigger clubs. For me, the most important thing is that we always try to replace the players with great young players with big potential.\"",
      "Hurzeler added: \"The second thing is the club also shows they can keep good players.",
      "\"There were big offers for Kaoru Mitoma (from Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in January), interest in Jan Paul van Hecke in this window, but the club showed they can stay strong, keep their best players as well.\"",
      "If that is the stance they take with Baleba in the final weeks of the summer window it could dent United's hopes of completing a transfer.",
      "The Brighton boss concluded: \"We know how we want to work here, we know the Brighton way, and we always try to get the best out of the players and try to be successful.",
      "\"I think we’ve shown it last season. Of course, we want to make improvements now.",
      "\"We still have high expectations of ourselves, we want to achieve more, and I think with the signings we’ve made, we haven’t got worse. That is what we have to prove now.\"",

Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "Antony's stint at Betis saw him revive his career and create a market for himself ahead of this summer's window. However, he is still yet to find out whether he will be offered a route out of Old Trafford after not playing a single minute of the club's pre-season campaign.",
      "Keen to sign the 25-year-old for a second time, Fajardo has confirmed both Betis and Antony want to get a deal done, but has suggested they will only be able to complete the deal if the finances involved are reasonable.",

      "Man Utd could free up an extra £75m in order to seal a record-breaking transfer for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have already invested a lot of money in their first four signings of the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha (£62.5m), Bryan Mbeumo (£65m), Benjamin Sesko (£74m) and Diego Leon (£7m) all arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Man Utd are still looking to sign at least another two players before the window shuts on September 1 with a midfielder and goalkeeper top of their agenda.",
      "Brighton star Baleba has emerged as their top target to occupy a midfield slot in Ruben Amorim’s side but the Seagulls have reportedly put a £120m asking price on his head, which would be a club-record deal for Man Utd.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano brought the latest on a potential deal for Baleba on Tuesday with Man Utd looking to “understand the final official cost” before making a bid.",
      "Romano said on GiveMeSport: “They would also like to know the actual cost because with Brighton, it’s never easy to negotiate, and they are very good at negotiations.",
      "READ: PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025",
      "“So in this context, they are having with the agents of the player, they are waiting to understand how much it will cost, because the rumour in the industry is something around £120million.",
      "“But at the moment, Manchester United are still waiting to understand the final official cost for Baleba – to understand when and how to try to make a bid, and to try to approach Brighton for Baleba.",
      "“For sure, the player is keen on the move, and the player is not closing doors to Manchester United even without European football. Baleba is keen on joining Manchester United, and now it will depend on the two clubs. My understanding is that Manchester United want to try.”",
      "Italian journalist Nicola Schira revealed earlier this week that Man Utd have already struck ‘an agreement in principle’ with the Brighton midfielder.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘#ManchesterUnited consider Carlos #Baleba as a main target and are ready to push to sign him. #MUFC are set to submit the first official bid to #Brighton as revealed today. Baleba has an agreement in principle with #mutd for a contract until 2030 + option for 2031. #transfers’",
      "After Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s stark warning around the Red Devils’ poor financial position earlier this year, there are concerns about how Man Utd would be able to afford a deal for Baleba.",
      "However, football finance expert Stefan Borson insists that Man Utd could get an extra £75m added to their transfer budget by rearranging their finances.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “Cash is probably their biggest challenge in terms of being able to do all these deals, but it depends how you structure the deals.",
      "“Likewise, it depends what your access to capital is from external parties. It may be that they’re just in a good position with Ratcliffe and the Glazers to either get Ratcliffe to put more money in and buy some more shares.",
      "“I think it’s unlikely, but it’s not impossible. Everybody will tell me it’s ridiculous to suggest the Glazers would stump up some cash. But again, it’s not impossible. I would say a lot of United fans would say it is impossible.",
      "“It’s also not impossible that they do an equity raise from institutional shareholders. Again, pretty unlikely, but not impossible.",
      "“Then the most likely scenario is that they just get some short-term debt. So, they have a larger facility on their working capital facility. They pay about 6 per cent on that, so 2 per cent over the bank rate, SONIA.",
      "“So, you pay about 6 per cent per annum on that money. They will probably say, look, we can get another £50-75million that way.",

      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer. United are still trying, though, bless ’em.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThe Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract and has said goodbye to the PSG fans after being ostracised by an unnamed person (it’s Luis Enrique). He looks destined for the Premier League, but United aren’t his most likely destination.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out. Elliott is said to be interested in what the Bundesliga has to offer.",
      "",
      "13) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",

      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",

      "8) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £35million-plus-£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off. Could Jack Grealish’s arrival impact things?",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least £40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against the Eagles in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required. Alas, their interest has intensified and personal terms reportedly agreed.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Giovanni Leoni – Parma to Liverpool\nLiverpool want Leoni in addition to Guehi and they might need to spend the same again to get the 18-year-old away from Parma. Apparently, Leoni is bang up for it having been told he will go straight into Arne Slot’s first-team squad.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. Romano reckons a verbal agreement is almost done after the two clubs were talking around the £40million mark.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club."

      "Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike have joined Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, respectively, meaning they are no longer headlining this ranking of the 10 best available strikers.",
      "Despite signing Ekitike, Liverpool are still in for Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak, who has crashed into this ranking to take top spot.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (RB Leipzig)\nLeipzig have already lost Benjamin Sesko, but they are reportedly willing to listen to offers for Openda, who has scored 33 goals in 67 Bundesliga matches.",
      "Sunderland have, ambitiously, been linked with the Belgian, while Aston Villa chose Evann Guessand over him.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football shouldn’t turn their nose at him, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either. But yes, a return to Turin feels inevitable.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Aleksandar Mitrovic (Al Hilal)\nMitrovic has been sitting around, watching his current employers aggressively pursuing striker after striker all summer. They eventually landed Darwin Nunez, which removes his name from this ranking and allows Mitrovic to crash in.",
      "A return to the Premier League has been mooted and there are plenty of teams that could be a lot worse. He’s scored 68 in 79 for the Saudi club, which does beg the question: Why did they want a new striker so badly? Ah well, their loss is another team’s gain. If Leeds United could pull this off, it would be an incredible coup.",
      "",
      "6) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "5) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, and the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney.",
      "Having broken a promise to the striker, the Bees are actively scouring the market for a replacement, so Wissa can get his move to Newcastle for around £30m.",
      "",
      "4) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nDuring his time at Leipzig, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. Newcastle have been linked, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa. A return to Germany seems the most likely move, with Leipzig keen on a reunion.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £35m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors. We have to assume he isn’t available for under £35m, because there are hardly any suitors.",

      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface is the forgotten striker of the 2025 summer transfer window. He’s the third-best available one out there, yet there is nothing to suggest he could leave Leverkusen this summer.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. That’s why Manchester United picked Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Hello, Newcastle.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nThis is getting awfully messy. Isak reportedly informed Newcastle of his decision to leave last month, amid interest from Liverpool. Since then, the Reds have failed with a £110m bid, the Magpies have failed to sign their number-one target to replace him, Benjamin Sesko, Isak hasn’t featured in pre-season, is training alone, has moved out of his house, and most importantly, was not allowed any hotdogs.",
      "Liverpool have already spent over £100m on Florian Wirtz, £70m combined on full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and an initial £69m on Ekitike, but they still want Isak. After selling Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz for over £100m, we should expect a second bid. £150m should do it.",
      "Isak is one of the best strikers in world football, and his transfer stance has shocked many and rightly upset Newcastle fans, who are now dreading the loss of their talisman. The Swedish international has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances for the Magpies.",
      "",
      "The Alexander Isak Transfer Saga is now officially scaling heights the like of which we may never see again. Thank you, Newcastle. Thank you, Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly set to ‘bid again’ for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak as the amount they are prepared to pay is revealed.",
      "Newcastle star Alexander Isak simply ‘wants a move to another club’. But if he was leaving Liverpool he would be a ‘fraud’, ‘mercenary’ and ‘out of order’.",
      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has moved out of his property in the North East as he continues to force a move to Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed that Alexander Isak is convinced he will not play for Newcastle again, even if they ‘refuse to sell’ him to Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool have been told the reduced price which ‘may yet offer a breakthrough’ to sign Isak from Newcastle as the “increasingly likely” outcome has been revealed."

      "“Sign Calvert-Lewin? On what grounds? No, I’m sorry, I disagree massively, I disagree massively. What message does that send to the rest of the Premier League or more importantly to your squad?”",
      "With the new Premier League season starting at the weekend, Ferdinand was also giving his predictions for how the new campaign will pan out come May.",
      "Giving his views on Man Utd and the Premier League’s top four, Ferdinand added: “I’m going to go Liverpool to win the league. Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City, Chelsea.",
      "“I think United are top eight, anything above that is ridiculous, like wow, wow, wow compared to what it was. Biggest improvement this season will be Man United.”",
      "When asked who would be top goalscorer, Ferdinand replied: “I’m going to go [Erling] Haaland. I’ve said [Alexander] Isak if he joins Liverpool but I don’t think he’s going to go there, so I’ve gone Haaland.”",

      "",
      "Pre-season predictions ahoy\nAnd just like that, we’re almost at the dawn of another Premier League season. With this in my mind, I thought I’d share a few thoughts and predictions;",
      "1) There will be a proper title fight – Liverpool look to have spent very well, however we all know that players coming into the Prem from other leagues are not guaranteed to be successful. I also think they look a bit thin at the back, and one serious injury to a first-choice centre back leaves them vulnerable. This said, I’ve just got a feeling Man City are going to be absolutely mint, and Chelsea will not be far behind. Unfortunately for Arsenal, I see them finishing a rather distant 4th, and so ending ‘The Process’.",
      "2) Man United will be very, very good – Amorim clearly has something about him. Yes, he’s hellbent on his system, but every time he speaks, I listen (and no, I’m not “Man Yoo”). You can’t 100% rule out Cunha having a ‘Cantona Moment’ and ending up in the crowd with his studs deep in someone’s neck, however you also can’t rule out him being utterly fabulous. He was just born to be a United player, wasn’t he?",
      "3) Sticking with matters at Old Trafford – Either Vardy or Calvert Lewin will sign on a free, late in the window on a 12-month deal.",
      "4) Glasner will not be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season – Clearly there are some frustrations with regards to recruitment at The Dogtrack (yes, I still miss you, Ted, Beard and Co.), and Glasner is also in the last year of his contract. A sticky start for Kompany at The Alianz, and it’s next-stop Munich for Olly G.",
      "5) Brentford could be many, many different kinds of f*cked – No explanation necessary, and still wishing you the best of luck, Keith.\nLeeds or Sunderland (or both) to stay up – I genuinely think Farke is a very good coach, and I think Sunlun’ have easily spent the best money of the three promoted teams. Given my previous comment regarding Brentord, and also with a slight worry for Wolves, I don’t think it’s out of the question one of, or even both Leeds and Sunlun’ survive (just). But what of Burnley I hear you ask, well……..",
      "6) Burnley to finish bottom and without Parker – Yes, they were promoted at a canter, but as long as I’ve got a hole up my ar*e, Scott Parker is not a Prem manager.",
      "Of course, now I’ve said all that, Arsenal will win the Prem and CL double, United will finish 15th (again) and Burnley will finish 11th (just above Palace, because…… well, Palace) with Parker wining manager of the Season. Either way, it’s nearly time and I for one, can’t f*cking wait.\nAndy FTM (I know I’ll regret saying this after he gets sent off for the 11th time on Boxing Day, but Granit Xhaka might just be the best £13 mil ever spent)",

      "Which club will be a pleasant surprise? Bias may come into, but I think Villa are being slept on. Missed out on CL football by goal difference having got to the QF of said competition. Can rotate more and still compete in the EL having not really lost many of the core squad. A pleasantish early fixture run too. I mean, see answer two.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? Oh. Hmmm. I may actually have to think about this for once… AFCON, Haaland might start slow, Isak may not start at all… Haaland pips Salah with a strong finish.",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? I think that Wirtz fella just be pretty good.",
      "And which one will turn out to be a massive flop? I think Gyokeres and Sesko will do enough. I’ll say Cunha, but with no conviction.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? Well, this is anyone’s Guessand?!",
      "Who will be named PFA Player of the Year? I can’t see it being Wirtz in year one and whilst the AFCON absence may affect Salah I’m still going to be sensible and say him.",

Obviously if they turn out to be laughably wrong I’ll go full Trump and insist it was fake news, Biden made me say it, Obama actually wrote it down, Crooked Hillary sent the email and anyway football doesn’t even exist.",

Don’t be surprised if Joe Root and Ben Stokes miss games for England with an RSI from signing autographs to several thousand people, just appreciate that they stayed to sign for everyone who asked.",
      "* Clearly it’s a preseason game so you can’t put too much stock in it, but there is something encouraging about being able to come back from a goal down against Liverpool twice. The nature of the goals were good, too. The penalty was won from some typical Palace play and the second goal was a high press, a defence-splitting pass from Adam Wharton to put Ismaila Sarr one-on-one with the goalkeeper.",
      "* Oliver Glasner said to Guardiola after their second Premier League meeting that if Manchester City played that way in the FA Cup Final, Palace would win. Clearly, he also had a plan to beat Liverpool and, in something that vindicates one of my opinions if not one many others would share, it involved Virgil van Dijk. A lot of people would understandably force play away from the Best Defender in the World, but that is to buy into the hype instead of seeing with your own eyes.",
      "For the past few seasons, van Dijk has been repeatedly guilty of ball-watching and many of the goals Liverpool concede, particularly against counter-attacking sides, come as a result of this.",
      "For the first goal, van Dijk is supposed to be marking Jean-Philippe Mateta, but leaves him to lunge in at Sarr without getting the ball. There was no need to make that tackle, had he simply held his position in the line Sarr would not have been able to shoot. For the second goal, he is not the only Liverpool player suckered in. When Wharton receives the ball, van Dijk is isolated two on one by Mateta and Sarr, but is actually covering neither of them because he is only looking at the ball. Taking a couple of steps towards Wharton gives the Palace man enough time and space to realise Sarr is completely unmarked. If van Dijk holds his position in the defensive line, there is significantly less chance Palace score.",
      "It says a lot for Alisson really that people don’t realise how frequently this happens, and a significant part of that is because the world’s actual best goalkeeper bails his teammate out so regularly that the mistakes don’t lead to goals.",
      "* On social media before the game virtually every big Palace fan account was asking people to be aware that a silence was going to be taking place for Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, and that people should either get to their seats before it or wait on the concourse so they didn’t accidentally interrupt it. I’ve no idea why someone would deliberately interrupt a tribute like that and can’t quite believe it has happened. There’s been very little ill will between Liverpool and Crystal Palace over the years, something underlined by those fan groups encouraging people to support the silence (and by Liverpool and Everton fans singling out Palace for their absence of poverty chants), I don’t know why you’d want to change that.",
      "* Speaking of ill will with Liverpool, we come to Notts “Nottingham” Forest. Again, it’s weird that a club without a history of being rivals with Palace should celebrate defeat at the CAS with the combined glee of winning the European Cup with Brian Clough and seeing Derby County getting relegated. Then again, despite the constant reminders in West Bridgford and beyond, we are a long way removed from that era of Forest. Towards the end of last season they were a bit like a Roy Hodgson team, blessed with some superb attacking talent but not really doing a lot of attacking, and not scoring many goals. How much longer that’s tolerated by their notoriously calm, measured and patient owner remains to be seen.",
      "Forest fans have really shown their arse the past few weeks. Smugly saying “rules are rules” throughout Palace’s legal challenge, conveniently ignoring the rules they broke in open and shut fashion over the previous couple of seasons and complained like hell about being punished for. Palace’s challenge did have merit even if it was unsuccessful, although if history has taught us anything about Forest supporters is that they aren’t that keen on standing up to the authorities, or solidarity with others.",
      "* At least now we can get on with the season, which starts away at Chelsea on Sunday. It wouldn’t be Chelsea if there wasn’t some sort of squad overhaul ongoing, but the players they do have are more than capable of winning the game. Palace meanwhile have a settled squad and a draw plus tie-breaker win over Liverpool under their belts, so it should be a fun one.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "On the hypocrisy of Forest\nAs a Palace fan, the demotion from the Europa League stings. As it is surely clear to any reasonable, unbiased person, we are not one of the MCO’s that UEFA, in their rules at least, seem to be trying to prevent. The details have been well documented, but expecting Palace to have done something by that deadline when, by their own club’s setup, Textor had no decisive influence seems absurd for a club that was bottom-half and had never won anything or played in Europe before…. who then did their utmost to correct the situation and can now literally have no affect on the integrity of the competition, which surely is the whole point of the MCO rules.",
      "But if ‘rules are rules’ is your thing, and for CAS it has to be, then it has been applied correctly. Yay UEFA! That will show them!",
      "However, what rankles the most is the part Nottingham Forest played in the situation, the merits of which had absolutely nothing to do with them.",

Silkeborg weren’t even in the same multi club structure on the date Drogheda won the cup. They lost their appeal to CAS, sucked it up and moved on. It cost Drogheda a minimum of €500k. To give context on how much this is worth, the prize money for winning the league is around €125k.",

      "Wokeness and freedom of movement are going to contribute to a change in transfer policies in clubs.",
      "If we look at some prominent and recent examples in Isak and TAA, it’s clear that clubs (businesses) can no longer rely on loyalty from their key employees.",
      "At some point legislation changes will follow and notice clauses, similar to those that exist in normal employment contracts, will become part of footballers employment contracts.",
      "Such clauses will likely only be executable in specific (transfer) windows but they will come. The courts will make this happen and it will change the way transfer markets operate.",
      "Players will be free to change clubs and with it will come a greater degree of business uncertainty. Different constraints would be put in place, non-compete clauses could exist stopping a transfer to a club in the same league. Salaries would be incentivised to achieve loyalty, the longer you stay the more your paid.",

      "World-class chat\n“World Class” – Are we actually just ALL wrong?",
      "So, as well as apologising for the length of this missive, I will begin by saying – the one thing most do agree on is that there is no designation or definition of World Class on which everyone will agree on and my recent grumbles on the threads of the last few days about negativity around the subject are also, arguably, very wrong, depending on your point of view. That said, since the World Class article was published, and through the myriad conversations I’ve had since, I did want to try to figure something out.",
      "Take a sigh…\nCount to three…",
      "What do we reveal about ourselves by what we deem “World Class”?",
      "I love hot takes, just as much as I love hot cakes (and that’s a lot), and myself, Paches, Keef, Chazztopher, Micki, can all bellow out that Beckenbauer wasn’t world class, Antony would be World Class if he’d just be given the right service, Saka is bang average, or all football is barely watchable since 1997, but removing absolutely all individual opinion from the conversation…",
      "Why does it matter what World Class is to each and all of us?",
      "It’s not like Ollie “130k a week” Watkins actually cares that Johnny Gatekeeper thinks he’s world class or not when he’s played and performed at pretty much every level while earning more money in a training session than a whole F365 commentariat combined earns in a week, so why do WE think it matters? I’ll admit, I’ve actually had my heart-rate increase this week when discussing some of the wilder takes (probably the cakes, mind but still) but on reflection, I realised the problem was that my definition of world class is about inclusion and so because of that it became personal to me that someone would think Paul Gascoigne wasn’t a world class footballer, not because I care about Gazza, (though I do, god bless him) but because I will never not feel that moments of magic are just as important as rote consistency in our game.",
      "To try to restrict who is world class, who is bargain bin, who is bang average, and who is Lee Cattermole, when definable boundaries are not clear, is to deflect yourself onto the discussion. Those that disclude goalkeepers clearly don’t value what a goalkeeper can do, but also might be fair to say are risk averse individuals… the kind who at 5 a side belts up the pitch, loses the ball then just turns and watches as his 4 mates get torn apart by his failings and shrugs. Those that want 300 players to be World Class are the intelligent ones who… I kid, obviously, but I am aware my desire to be inclusive shows a large part of my lack of standards. The fact I genuinely think the impressive careers of Milner and Barry, great as they were, haven’t left the same cultural impact on football that say, the short careers of Wilshere or Dele did… (now THAT’s a hot take.)",
      "So for my part, while I remain resolute that “my” version of World Class is one that is more inclusive of the deficiencies of football (after all, what IS a perfect footballer?*) and allowing of bad days, I do want to make it clear that I appreciate some don’t like to colour outside the lines, or hear a bum note in a live album, and I am here for it, for it is our differences that make our sport what it is.",
      "In the immortal words of Yoda himself, “World Class may be Beckenbauer, but appreciate him you may not”.",
      "Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk\nHarold Evanescence Hooler\n* The answer is Lee Cattermole, it was always Lee Cattermole.",

      "…Really interesting observation from Matt Pitt re: world class vs. good in their position. I was a bit surprised to see VVD (and Beckenbauer) in the latter list, but it got me thinking since Matt’s world class list had no defenders. Using his definition of talent evidenced anywhere on the pitch, what defenders were or are world class? Maldini? Baresi? Maybe Rio? But if not Beckenbauer, I think it’s hard to say any of these are world class too. Can defenders be world class or are we just putting the tallest four at the back and hoping for the best?\nNiall, Annapolis",

Not a United fan by any stretch but it had 2 free cans of Vimto and a couple of Freddos in the fridge so Neville’s alright in my book. Or so I thought, until I checked out the bathroom.",
      "Little packets of body wash, lotion, shampoo and conditioner were provided, and they’re in fun little packets that resemble a football shirt, how nice! Then I looked at the kit numbers, and the more I looked the worse it got. Shampoo was number 2, fine, I won’t argue but its partner conditioner was busy wearing 20-something. Body lotion took the number 8, with actual body wash rocking a number 11. These are obviously incorrect and so I decided to try and flesh out my own bathroom starting 11, I ran out of steam a little towards the end but if you’re reading this Gary, you’re welcome.",
      "1 – Hand Soap – Not the most glamorous product but you always appreciate a good one and you won’t get far without it\n2 – Toothpaste – Essential at both ends of the day\n3 – Mouthwash – Holding up the opposite flank and just as important at both ends\n4 – Floss/gum cleaners – Nobody’s favourite job but the best ones make a huge difference to your title aspirations/dental bills\n5 – Facial Scrub – your number 4 needs a partner and your face needs to look good. It’s at this point I almost regret this idea.\n6 – Body Wash – anchoring that morning shower. Now we’re back in business after a bit of a stretch for 5.\n7 – Lotion – Adding some silky, scented flair to the morning routine\n8 – Shampoo – A key cog but sometimes overshadowed by some of the lovely scented conditioners further up the field.\n9 – Conditioner – the star of the show, the only reason my hair is ever acceptable for public display and the one we always spend the big bucks on.\n10 – Deodorant – because I’ve run out of cleaning products.\n11 – Aftershave – See above.\nManjo, LFC (I think I am supposed to say “and now show me yours!” but anyone posting any variance on those numbers is objectively wrong, and probably quite ugly)"

      "There’s only one Liverpool new boy in our top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United all have two…",
      "",
      "10) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be a thing, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. Some of their business points to the same mistakes being made, but landing Xhaka is doing things differently.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed out £55m, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "A few Chelsea signings deserve an honourable mention. Jorrel Hato, Estevao and Kendry Paez are three outstaning talents.",
      "",
      "8) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "7) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. We’re not expecting Erling Haaland numbers from Gyokeres, but we’re still backing him to be a success at the Emirates.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Chelsea and Liverpool dominate top 10 genius Premier League player sales this summer\n👉 PSR? What PSR? Eight Premier League sides in 10 biggest spenders of summer 2025\n👉 Ten brilliant players ‘too old’ for a transfer in an ageist Premier League",
      "",
      "5) Martin Zubimendi (Arsenal)\nZubimendi has looked very promising in pre-season, with Mikel Arteta delighted to build his team around the Spanish defensive midfielder as his anchor. He should help Martin Odegaard get back to his best and now Declan Rice can relax, knowing that his full-time position is further up the pitch, providing support for Gabriel Martinelli on the left.",
      "The ex-Real Sociedad star looks like the calming presence every top team needs in the middle of the park. He might not reach Rodri’s level, but he can reach Rodri levels of influence on this Gunners side.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal for United.",
      "",
      "3) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",

      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Florian Wirtz’s father has revealed why the player snubbed interest from Bayern Munich to join Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator is ‘unthinkable’ but means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’."

      "",
      "10) Burnley – £111.89m\nFor their latest attempt at Premier League survival, Burnley have decided to build around some Chelsea cast-offs and some loanees whose deals were made permanent.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £132.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "",
      "10) Kai Havertz (Arsenal) – £280,000 a week\nArsenal’s highest earner just makes the top 10, making a few quid ahead of Gabriel Jesus and £40k a week more than Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard.",
      "",
      "9) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish has joined Everton on loan and reports suggest the Toffees have taken liability for most of his salary for the season.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably weep weekly when similar amounts leave their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Casemiro’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "",
      "6) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "5) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) – £325,000 a week\nArsenal copped for around 30% of Sterling’s salary when he was on loan at the Emirates last season but he’s all Chelsea’s problem now. At least appearance money isn’t a problem…",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money, but we remain to see if that remains the case through the deal he recently penned to stay for two more seasons.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. United have tried to shift his salary off their books but with a year to go, so far, there have been no takers. Sounds like a job for the Saudi lads.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. The new deal earned the striker a £2.6million-a-year pay rise and though £41million over two years might terrify the weirdos who think a footballer is finished at 30, it would have cost a sh*te sight more to replace him.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

However, he has been left out of Wednesday’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, after the signing of Lucas Chevalier, who is set to become first choice.",
      "With Donnarumma entering the final year of his £300,000-a-week contract, PSG are ‘ready to move him on’ this summer, according to GiveMeSport.",
      "United are understood to be ‘open to taking advantage’ of the situation with a loan offer, with a permanent deal ‘difficult to sanction’.",
      "That stance is largely due to the presence of Andre Onana, with the club reluctant to have two high-earning goalkeepers on their books.",
      "The Red Devils have explored potential exits for the Cameroon international, with interest from Saudi Arabia and AS Monaco earlier in the window, but no agreement has been reached.",
      "The website suggests that United could look to move Onana out on loan, or even keep him to compete with Donnarumma if a financially viable loan arrangement with PSG can be struck.",
      "PSG are not presently open to a loan move for the 26-year-old, preferring to secure a permanent sale. However, the Italian international is unhappy with how he has been treated, which has caught the attention of city rivals Manchester City.",
      "Should any other club attempt to sign Donnarumma permanently, then United’s chances of landing him on loan should be dashed.",
      "The report states:",
      "Any loan deal for the former AC Milan stopper would mean PSG need to change their stance on a loan move though, as PSG are not currently open to that situation. However, the player is disappointed with the way he has been dealt with this summer and it’s possible he could push for an exit on his own terms.",
      "United know what it’s like to get stuck with players they’ve been keen to move, and they could look to use that experience by negotiating terms with PSG that are favorable for all parties.",
      "However, there is a threat that any loan move could fall apart if another club made an offer to sign the player permanently instead, as that is PSG’s preferred option. Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City have both been linked with an interest in the 26-year-old, but sources understand nothing of substance has happened in either case so far.",

      "But Isak decided to take matters into his own hands, after an approach from the Reds was pushed away, by telling the Newcastle hierarchy that he wants to leave this summer.",
      "That triggered a £110m bid from Liverpool, which was instantly rejected by the Geordies, and the Merseysiders will only go back in if they receive sufficient encouragement that a deal will be done.",
      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealed earlier on Tuesday that Isak ‘is adamant he will never represent Newcastle again’ despite the Magpies attempting to keep him.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘Even if they refuse to sell the 25-year-old Sweden striker and he remains on Tyneside when the transfer window closes, Isak regards his career at St James’s Park as finished and has no desire to reintegrate into the squad.’",

      "Marcus Rashford has described Manchester United as \"reactionary\" and being in \"no man's land\" - and has called on his club to \"make a plan and stick to it.\"",
      "Rashford departed United to join Barcelona on loan for the upcoming season after a similar, successful spell at Aston Villa for the second half of last season. This was after the forward had been frozen out of United's first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "And now, Rashford has hit out at the club's strategy in recent years - saying the club have not begun a transition yet because they do not have a recognisable style of play throughout the club.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",
      "\"We've been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months - what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we've been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it's like the actual transition's not started yet.",
      "\"To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel - it's not easy. Because if it's not going well, the fans demand [change].",
      "\"But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we've had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of - you end up in no man's land.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed which managers have been the most influential in his career - citing Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as inspirations - but he left out Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The forward also went into detail about Mourinho's desire to win at United - irrespective of how well you played.",
      "\"They're different but because we've had so many different managers, it's impossible for me to compare [them],\" added Rashford.",
      "\"Up until Jose, I never had a manager who was so fixated on winning. Van Gaal was fixated on winning but he wanted to play a beautiful style of football. Jose didn't care.",
      "\"Of course, if he could choose, he would want you to play well, but if you win, you win and move onto the next game. He had this attitude.",
      "\"And it was confusing for me as all the way through my development at United, it was about playing a certain style and winning in a certain way.",
      "\"And in the beginning I was angry all the time - because we had not played well and we won. But because we won and he is a manager who is just a winner, he didn't bring up the points that you know were missing from that last game. Because we've won.",
      "\"But when we lost, he would bring up the points then. After six months, I learned to respect it and reap the rewards from him as a coach.\"",
      "Rashford also discussed the importance of the move to Barcelona on his chances of making England's World Cup squad next summer.",
      "The 27-year-old was named in new head coach Thomas Tuchel's first Three Lions squad back in March - but missed the June camp due to injury.",
      "\"I try not to put too much pressure on the England set-up,\" said the Barcelona forward. \"It's clearly something I want to do.",
      "\"But you don't get that without putting in the hard work just day in, day out. And showing the hard work on the pitch. That's a knock-on effect to the stuff I'll be doing day in, day out.",
      "\"This current group of English players is extremely talented, it's going to be disappointing if we don't manage to go on and do something really special because I think we've come on a lot. For the last few years, it's been: the next step is to go on and win.\"",
      "Rashford also paid tribute to his former club Villa - saying the brief spell at Unai Emery's side went \"exactly how it was supposed to be\" after struggling at United.",
      "\"The timing of me going to Villa, now looking back, it was the exact time for me to do something like that,\" he said. \"The response and reaction of what I got from the people at the club and the fans, it was what I needed in that moment.",
      "\"Six months on, I feel like everything is completely different. Everything I did at Villa, apart from the injury at the end, was exactly how it was supposed to be. The club's on the up so the atmosphere at the club in that dressing room was positive.\""

      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Ready to do it all again? The 2025/26 Premier League season is here; An epic title race awaits, goals are guaranteed & newly promoted teams up for the scrap; \"The Premier League is on a completely different level to anything else in world football,\" says Jamie Carragher",
      "Tuesday 12 August 2025 14:04, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "Manchester United win 5-4 on penalties.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was unveiled by Manchester United as their new striker before Ruben Amorim’s side drew 1-1 with a Fiorentina team that included old favourite David de Gea in goal; Kobbie Mainoo’s winner in the penalty shoot-out secured the Snapdragon Cup",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 18:04, UK",
      "Manchester United beat Fiorentina on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Snapdragon Cup at Old Trafford that saw Benjamin Sesko introduced to the crowd as their new striker.",
      "Sesko's move from RB Leipzig for a fee rising to £73.7m was confirmed on the morning of the match and he was presented to supporters on the pitch alongside fellow new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who both started for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "With the £50m revamp of their Carrington training ground also unveiled this week, there is a growing sense of renewal at United, although it did not take long for Fiorentina to pierce that when Simon Sohm seized upon sloppy defending to put the visitors ahead at a corner.",
      "United levelled it up midway through the first half when Bruno Fernandes whipped in a cross that Robin Gosens appeared to divert over the line amid a melee of bodies. David de Gea, honoured beforehand by his old club, was among those complaining of a foul.",
      "Sohm almost scored again after the break, striking the United crossbar. Fernandes, Harry Maguire and, in particular, Cunha searched for a winner for the home side in a second half that saw young defender Ayden Heaven depart the field due to an injury.",
      "De Gea received a standing ovation when substituted late on, which prevented him taking part in the penalty shoot-out that United won when Altay Bayindir saved Fabiano Parisi's kick, allowing Kobbie Mainoo to secure the victory for the Red Devils.",
      "0-1 GOAL! Moise Kean scores\n\n1-1 GOAL! Bruno Fernandes scores\n\n1-2 GOAL! Jacopo Fazzini scores\n\n2-2 GOAL! Matheus Cunha scores\n\n2-3 GOAL! Abdelhamid Sabiri scores\n\n3-3 GOAL! Diogo Dalot scores\n\n3-4 GOAL! Cher Ndour scores\n\n4-4 GOAL! Amad Diallo scores\n\n4-4 SAVED! Fabiano Parisi denied\n\n5-4 GOAL! Kobbie Mainoo scores",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim speaking to MUTV:",
      "\"We had some difficulties, especially in the beginning of the first half and the beginning of the second half. They have a lot of mobility and we struggled to find the right moment to press. But then we controlled the game.",
      "\"We had a lack of fluidity in the game. We can do better. But I think it was a perfect game of preparation to show us that we need to improve in the different areas and that we are going to struggle in some moments. But sometimes we have players that can make a play and to elevate the stadium.\"",
      "Asked about Mbeumo and Cunha's relationship: \"It's going to be special. I think they are maybe 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.",
      "\"Like any other team, we are going to improve during the season and they are going to be so much better.",
      "\"In some moments, I felt that we need, because of the one-against-one in all the pitch, we struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.\"",
      "\"Manchester United's need for a new striker was clear with Mason Mount playing as the frontman and Rasmus Hojlund left on the bench. Their threat mainly came from set-pieces and the goal likely would have been ruled out if VAR were in use.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim will be comforted by the presence of Sesko to address that issue in the weeks to come, but the midfield will be a cause for concern for the United head coach.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "\"Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes were not able to dominate this game for Manchester United and the play has been disjointed at times.",
      "\"That will surely be an area of the team Amorim hopes to address in the final three weeks or so of this window. There is an interest in Carlos Baleba, who seems ideally suited to the system.",
      "\"However, it seems unlikely at this stage given Brighton would ask for a huge fee and haven't got a replacement in. The current options aren't ideal for Amorim.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
