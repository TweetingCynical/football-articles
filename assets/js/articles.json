      "We've entered the final week of the Premier League season before attention turns firmly to the summer transfer window - with a number of clubs poised to act.",
      "Liverpool won't waste any time in bolstering their champion squad with Jeremie Frimpong set to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has ran down his contract and is poised to join Real Madrid imminently. They are also among those linked with Florian Wirtz.",
      "They face competition from Manchester City, who will wave goodbye to Kevin De Bruyne this week with the Belgian leaving when his deal expires. Across town Manchester United's focus is on Wednesday's Europa League final - which will have a huge influence on their transfer business.",
      "Arsenal have wrapped up second place and know they face a massive summer if they want to take that next step. A move for either Viktor Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko has been tipped.",
      "Napoli remain keen on Darwin Nunez, according to reports in Italy. Sporting director Giovanni Manna is said to have held talks over a move for the Uruguayan, though the Serie A side also have other options.",
      "If Nunez goes down a different route, Jonathan David could find himself at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. The Canadian is out of contract at Lille this summer and available on a free transfer.",
      "Napoli are expected to cash in on Victor Osimhen this summer, with those funds going towards attacking reinforcements. Osimhen has starred for Galatasaray during a loan spell, and is the subject of Premier League interest.",
      "Arsenal co-chair Josh Kroenke has set the tone for a big summer with Andrea Berta in charge of transfers. Kroenke covered the topic in a letter to fans, which was shared in the programme ahead of the final home league game of the season.",
      "\"We plan to invest to get behind winning and doing better next season,\" the American wrote. \"We’re delighted we have our sporting director, Andrea, who will play an important role in this.",
      "\"He is part of a unified and strong team, supported by the board, who are crystal clear on exactly what we need to do and the way in which we want to do it. The right way. The Arsenal way.\"",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is expected to sign a five-year deal with Liverpool. The Leverkusen star is on his way for a medical, with the deal all but done.",
      "Frimpong's release clause - in the region of £30m - makes things a little more straightforward. He is understood to have already agreed personal terms, and could well be announced as the first new arrival this summer.",
      "Of course, one new signing has already been confirmed the best part of a year ago. Giorgi Mamardashvili is on his way from Valencia, with the Georgian becoming Arne Slot's first signing but only joining this year.",
      "Rise and shine - we're here to bring you all the latest! Stay tuned throughout the day"

      "The squad desperately needs to be overhauled, with Amorim eyeing a number of new signings. But their hopes of signing Dan Ndoye have been dashed after Bologna moved to tie the winger down to a new deal.",
      "United had been lining up a move for Ndoye, but the Serie A side are desperate to keep hold of him. Elsewhere, the Red Devils have also seen Paris Saint-Germain position themselves to enter the race for River Plate’s Franco Mastantuono.",
      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Dan Ndoye have suffered a significant blow after Bologna moved to hand him a new long-term deal. The winger has impressed for the Serie A side, scoring the winner as they beat AC Milan in the Coppa Italia final.",
      "According to TuttoSport, United had been on Ndoye's 'trail', even sending scouts to watch him lift the Italian Cup. But it is said that Bologna are now attempting to 'shield' him from a move with a new deal.",
      "His current contract expires in the summer of 2027 and Bologna are now preparing to offer a 'significant' increase on his salary. Bologna hope that will be enough to force United to end their interest.",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney has urged his former club to make three key moves this summer. Rooney believes the Red Devils should bring back David De Gea, make Victor Osimhen their top striker target and make a 'difficult' move for Crystal Palace skipper Marc Guehi.",
      "\"I'd sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he would do an amazing job. Second I'd sign Osimhen as a number nine,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.",
      "\"He's a good striker and possibly available. The third one I'd sign, it would probably be difficult, but I'd try to sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back he'd have a really good impact.\"",
      "Paris Saint-Germain have entered the race to sign River Plate star Franco Mastantuono, dealing a blow to Manchester United. The Red Devils had been eyeing a move for the midfielder.",
      "He has made 17 appearances for River, who sit second in Group B of the Argentine Primera Division. United had sent scouts to watch him, with the 17-year-old having a £37m release clause in his contract.",
      "But according to TyC Sports, PSG have now entered the race to sign Mastantuono. They have already started talks with his representatives, with the French champions said to view him as a 'top priority'."

      "Patrick Dorgu's middle name is Chinazaekpere - which translates as ‘God Answers Prayers.’",
      "And the Manchester United defender is putting his faith in helping Manchester United beat Tottenham in the Europa League Final on Wednesday night to deliver a place in the Champions League.",
      "Dorgu, the Copenhagen-born wing-back of Nigerian heritage, inherited his strong religious beliefs from his parents. He explained: “My family are religious and the reason they gave me my middle name was because of the meaning behind it.",
      "“They told me at a young age what it meant. It comes from my Ebo heritage. My family’s culture is something I learned about. I believe in God and I am always praying. I hope we win the final - it’s what I am praying for.”",
      "Dorgu, 20, came through the academy at Nordsjaelland before moving to Italian club Lecce.",
      "He became Ruben Amorim’s first United signing when he arrived at Old Trafford for £25million during the winter transfer window after the club’s scouts suggested he was the perfect fit for the Portuguese’s tactical preference.",
      "Dorgu said: “My thinking was that I was moving to one of the biggest teams in the world, big names, big players so for me at the age of just 20 it would be better for me to progress and develop my talent.",
      "“It would mean a lot to me and to the club and the players to win the Europa League. We're not angry, but we are disappointed about this season. I’m getting better game by game, getting more confident so I hope I can improve even more in the last three games of this season and in the seasons to come.",

      "“Spurs are a dangerous opponent. They have beaten us three times already this season, so we can’t think it will be easy.",
      "“They have beaten us twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup, so it will be a tough game even though both teams haven’t been playing well.”"

      "Emi Martinez's uncertain Aston Villa future has left Manchester United and Barcelona exploring a move, it has been claimed. Martinez has been the subject of interest from the Saudi Pro League, but could yet end up staying in Europe.",
      "The Argentina number one was visibly emotional at the end of Villa's final home game of the season, a victory over Tottenham, as was Saudi-linked team-mate Leon Bailey. Manager Unai Emery wasn't able to confirm the keeper would be staying, sparking plenty of speculation.",
      "“Of course, it is the last match (of the season) here, and I don’t know,” Emery said after the 2-0 win. \"We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field, at the moment they are responding and they are so, so focused in how we are preparing and playing each match.",
      "“Of course, Leon Bailey is playing now less because other players are responding very well. They are performing well.",
      "“And we are going to play Manchester (United) for the last three points. And for us it will be very important again, to prepare, to be focused everybody.\"",
      "According to reports in Argentina (via The Sun), Barcelona and United are both ready to make Martinez their new starting keeper if they can get a deal over the line. United's current first choice Andre Onana has come under scrutiny for some high-profile errors, while Barca stopper Marc-Andre ter Stegen has played just once since September due to injury.",
      "Ter Stegen returned to the fold against Valladolid at the start of May but has since returned to the bench. Wojciech Szczesny has started regularly in the German's absence, but his own future is uncertain after he came out of retirement to join the Catalan club.",
      "United, meanwhile, are unlikely to spend big on a new keeper but may still spend. Head coach Ruben Amorim laid out the situation amid questions over the future of Cameroon international Onana.",
      "\"We cannot change all the players. We need to improve every position on the field,\" the Portuguese said just days before the Europa League final, where Onana is likely to start despite being dropped earlier in the campaign.",

      "“Things in life don't always go the way you want them to but when I got there the truth is I had a lot of help from him and at that moment my football exploded. I'm really grateful to him for that.”",
      "Gratitude may be in short supply should United deny Spurs a first trophy in 17 years. Both teams travel to northern Spain approaching the end of diabolical domestic campaigns. Spurs’ defeat at Aston Villa on Friday was their 21st in the league, leaving head coach Ange Postecoglou on the brink irrespective of this week’s outcome.",

      "Ian Wright has admitted that he would love to have Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes at Arsenal. Fernandes, 30, has been wearing the armband for the Red Devils in a campaign which has been terrible domestically, but still offers the opportunity for European silverware.",
      "While United could still gain qualification for the Champions League by beating Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, Arsenal will have to accept another campaign without a major trophy.",
      "With the season ending soon, attention is turning to the transfer window, where Arsenal are on the verge of signing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi, with a move for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres also potentially on the cards. However, Wright, who has previously defended Fernandes from a Roy Keane onslaught, would be over the moon to see his former side turn their attention to the Portugal international.",
      "While speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Wright said: \"I wish we had Bruno Fernandes. I wish we had Bruno. I would love to have him at Arsenal.\"",
      "The ex-Gunners striker has repeatedly defended the United skipper when Keane has unleashed him. After Wright's latest defence on the podcast last month, the ex-United skipper said: \"Ah Wrighty, I've had enough of that rubbish!",
      "\"You watch United every week, we focus more on United. Sit and watch a game with him! People pretend to be closing people down.",
      "\"Talent is not enough! You keep going back to talent - Bruno's a talented player, but it's not enough! Who were you in the dressing room with, Tony Adams! Tony Adams was this, Tony Adams was that, because he was a fighter!",
      "\"You've got young players who have to look at somebody and go, ‘I like what he does.’ They all can't put the ball in the top of the net from 25 yards, I get that, but you want someone who's going, 'Lads, are you with me? Are you with me?'\"",
      "Wright told Keane that comparing modern captains like Fernandes to the likes of Adams is unhelpful, saying: \"Maybe he's not that kind of captain, Roy, I'm with you, but what he's doing in respect of... saving you, playing that pass, the goal. If Bruno's not there, United are in the relegation battle.”",
      "Despite Wright's admiration of Fernandes, it's unlikely the Gunners would target a move for him. Arteta already has club captain Martin Odegaard in Fernandes' position, while Declan Rice is being encouraged to maraud forward more often.",
      "Zubimendi's potential arrival would only encourage the aforementioned duo to occupy more forward positions, while Kai Havertz may also be given more opportunities to play behind a striker should the Gunners sign a centre-forward like Gyokeres. Moreover, the chances of United doing business with Arsenal for a player as important as Fernandes are also highly unlikely.",
      "The silky playmaker's deal expires in the summer of 2027, but there appears to be no sign that he is agitating for a move out of Old Trafford. However, reports from the Daily Star at the end of March claimed Real Madrid were interested in the midfielder and were considering a shock £90million move.",
      "If United lose the final in Bilbao on Wednesday, then Fernandes, who has been at the club since January 2020, will have to face up the reality of another season without Champions League football, despite his undoubted quality. While the season has been a poor one for United, he has still contributed 19 goals and 19 assists in all competitions.",
      "The ex-Sporting midfielder's numbers are far superior to Odegaard's, who has struggled to replicate his performances from the 2023/24 campaign. The Norwegian has only managed five goals and 11 assists compared to last year's record of 11 goals and 12 assists."

United have suffered their worst season of the Premier League era, with Ruben Amorim's under-performing side down in 16th place, after 18 defeats this season.",
      "But United can still salvage something from their otherwise miserable season by beating Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. As well as lifting the trophy, the winners will also go straight into next season's Champions League, which is worth up to £100million in revenue.",
      "And although their domestic form has been pitiful, Mazraoui claimed that will largely be forgotten if Amorim's players are victorious against Spurs. “Winning a trophy is never easy,” said Mazraoui.",

      "In contrast to losing almost half of their Premier League games this season, United are the only team that started out in the Europa League or Champions League to remain unbeaten. It is something United defender Mazraoui cannot explain.",
      "“That's something really tough to say, because we always manage in the Europa League to eventually win,” said the Morocco international. “I think the biggest example was Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last 10 minutes of the game. Extra-time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.",
      "“I think one of the biggest differences in the Europa League and the Premier League for us this season is how to manage to win. We maybe have that kind of fighting spirit in the Europa League that we maybe lack in the Premier League.”",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",

      "Tottenham have beaten United on all three occasions they have met this season, but Mazraoui claimed that will have no bearing on the outcome of Wednesday's make-or-break showdown.",
      "“I don't think so, because this is a whole different competition,” said Mazraoui. “It's the Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you can't really compare any previous games with this final.",
      "“Tottenham bring a lot of intensity in their games. We've seen that already this season. That's their biggest quality - they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything they do.”"

      "\"You're in the zone. I always say I was in the zone. I used to say to people, and they didn't quite understand it, I was going to war every week.\"",
      "The manner of his exit meant that Keane had a different view of the club than many of his United team-mates, despite being crucial to the glory that they achieved under Ferguson. However, almost 18 years later, Keane shocked supporters by appearing in the reveal video for United’s third kit in 2023.",
      "A joint statement from the club and kit manufacturer said: “Manchester United and Adidas are proud to work with Roy Keane, one of the club’s most iconic and popular former players. Roy won 17 trophies with Manchester United, his fearless playing style and never give up attitude has earned him a special place in the hearts of Manchester United fans around the world.”",
      "Keane has been vocal about United's relative underachievement since Ferguson stepped down as manager in 2013. The 53-year-old has been brutally honest in his assessment of various United players, but former team-mate Mikael Silvestre feels that the club can use Keane’s feedback to their advantage, and backed him to join current boss Ruben Amorim’s staff in an advisory role",
      "“I think it would be great for Roy Keane to play a role at Manchester United,” Silvestre told Yaysweepstakes.com. “Because, the thing is with Roy, he always treated everybody exactly the same way. It didn’t matter if you were a new signing, an old guy, the manager, everybody.",
      "\"That's how he got respect. That's how Sir Alex got respect. If you treat everybody the same, no problem. I think it’s a bit of a problem with this generation of players. They find criticism harder to take.",
      "\"If Roy Keane was involved at Manchester United, if he was on the inside with the group, he would have to protect and work for the group. You wouldn’t see him criticising players in public, so there wouldn't be any issue.”",
      "Ex-United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer agreed with Silvestre and saw the value in the expertise that Keane could pass on to his squad. In 2019, Solskjaer invited Keane to the club’s Carrington training ground to speak to the players, four years before he would feature in the kit reveal video.",
      "In terms of how the meeting unfolded, a source told the Mirror: “As you’d imagine, Roy has strong views on what it takes to be a proper United player, and he gave it to them straight.",
      "“He wasn’t impressed with one player who didn’t seem to be all that interested and looked as if he’d rather be somewhere else. But for the majority, it was a fascinating snapshot into the hunger and desire that drove Roy during his time at the club.”",
      "Keane may have reached some form of truce with United in recent years, but that has not prevented him from sharing his thoughts on the current hierarchy. Before Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim this season, Keane suggested that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those in charge of football operations had undermined the Dutch coach by changing his backroom staff.",
      "\"I'm not saying he's not a good manager or he hasn't got good coaching staff, but in the summer they changed all the coaching staff,” Keane argued on the Stick to Fooball podcast. “So you're on about a manager having a bit of power and control of the football club – I'll bet you Ten Hag's got none of that!",
      "\"So players will look at the manager and go, 'Well, all your staff went in the summer. I didn't see you fighting for any of them. You're bringing more staff in.' I just think it looks chaotic, doesn't it?\"",
      "Keane has been frequently touted for the United job, despite last managing Ipswich Town in 2011. There was speculation that he could follow in the footsteps of United legends Solskjaer, Ryan Giggs, and Michael Carrick by taking charge on an interim basis. However, Keane quickly shut down the suggestion, having already critiqued the manager’s lack of power at the club.",
      "\"They're not gonna be asking me. They just wouldn't... they just wouldn't,” Keane told Arsenal great Ian Wright. When asked about the possibility of taking over at Old Trafford on a short-term basis, Keane said: \"I'm not leaving you, Wrighty.“"

      "Ruben Amorim is working out his best line-up to beat Spurs in Bilbao, with the United boss considering dropping Hojlund on the bench.",
      "The return of Amad from injury has given Amorim greater attacking options and the United boss is said to be considering starting him against Spurs.",
      "That could see Hojlund displaced from the starting line-up, with captain Bruno Fernandes potentially playing as a false nine, supported by Amad and Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "Keane said: \"They've got no striker. Hojlund looked like he'd just come out of the academy. His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play. Again, if you're a striker playing for United - even for the whole team - one shot on target?'",
      "\"We keep making excuses for him. We talk about confidence, but you still think, when you're a striker, you have to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"What the big clubs have - and what United have always had - is strikers who can produce something for themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they have quality, a bit of determination, a bit of experience, football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund.\""

      "Wayne Rooney has identified three key signings that could help Manchester United bounce back from their worst-ever Premier League season. And one of them is a return for former goalkeeper David de Gea.",
      "The Red Devils, who have won the Premier League a record 13 times, are currently languishing in 16th place with a record low of 39 points. Their dismal league performances have continued under Ruben Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Despite their chronic struggles in the league, United will salvage Champions League football from the season if they can defeat Tottenham in Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "However, the squad clearly needs a complete overhaul to compete at the highest level domestically and in Europe next season. Rooney, United's all-time leading goalscorer, believes that the addition of his former team-mate De Gea, along with striker Victor Osimhen and defender Marc Guehi, could be the catalyst for a turnaround.",
      "Speaking to Amazon Prime Video Sport, the former England forward said: \"I'd probably sign David de Gea back. I think Manchester United have missed him and I think he could still do a very good job.",
      "\"The second one, I would sign Osimhen. He's a number nine, I think he's a really good striker and possibly available. And the third one, it would be difficult but I'd sign Guehi from Crystal Palace. As a centre-back, I think he would have a really good impact on the club.\"",
      "De Gea enjoyed 12 seasons at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League title once and being crowned United's Player of the Season four times. The 34-year-old was let go in July 2023 and spent nearly a year searching for a new team before joining Fiorentina at the start of this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been a standout performer for the Serie A side, helping them to secure European football while making it to the Europa Conference League semi-finals. He is set to face United in a pre-season match this summer, which will undoubtedly be an emotional encounter for the Spaniard. His replacement, Andre Onana, who was brought in for his superior ball-playing skills, has made numerous high-profile blunders since his £47.2million arrival from Ajax in 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, another United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has made it clear what he thinks the team needs. He said: \"Forget Delap's ability, potential, whatever you want to say about him. It's not about that right now for Man United. I think they need experience in there.",
      "\"Someone who knows how to score and someone that these younger guys can learn off. Rasmus Hojlund needs help. He doesn't need a competitor.\"",
      "England and Crystal Palace defender Guehi is in demand too. The 24-year-old, who has been linked with Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham, will come with a hefty price tag, especially after helping Palace to FA Cup glory against Manchester City."

      "Ruben Amorim's men will jet out to Bilbao this week hoping to beat Premier League rivals Tottenham in a bid to end their disastrous season with silverware, while also catapulting themselves into the Champions League.",
      "However, United come into the final in poor form, having lost five of their last six games in the Premier League and manager Amorim has even questioned whether he is the right man to take the team forward.",
      "But if United are successful in beating Spurs in the showpiece, Amorim will have a much larger budget as part of the lucrative TV money on offer from competing in Europe's elite competition.",
      "Both of the club's transfer wishlists have been curated to put together a squad that will be able to deliver on Amorim's tactical vision - which has so far failed to come to fruition following 13 defeats in 26 games under the Portuguese boss.",
      "There have been some concerns that Amorim may walk out on the team at the end of the season after his brutal comments about the clubs' fortunes.",
      "He infamously claimed his side were \"the worst team in the history of Manchester United\" and also said he was \"embarrassed\" about their situation and they were \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\".",

      "But first they have a chance to add some positivity to a wretched season when they fly out to Spain this week. United warmed up for their season-defining clash against Tottenham with a 1-0 loss to Chelsea and played a full-strength side - with Amorim keen to ensure his players are sharp going into the final.",
      "Amorim has been insistent that winning the trophy won't salvage their campaign and believes his team face many issues in the future regardless.",
      "He said: \"Europa League will not change anything in our problems - it's going to help us to have Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",
      "\"We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, a good academy. This is what we need to change to take this club back to the top. This is more of a shortcut to go to European games. Nothing more.\""

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's reflections after Manchester United's FA Cup triumph last year hinted a lack of faith in his much-talked-about Project 150.",
      "Despite going in as underdogs against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, the Red Devils pulled off a stunning 2-1 victory, courtesy of goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo which overshadowed Jeremy Doku's goal. The win came as a shock to supporters up and down the country and marked the team's sole piece of silverware for the season.",
      "Ratcliffe, who holds a minority stake in United, didn't shy away from acknowledging his team's outsider status but heaped praise on their Wembley performance after the match. \"Manchester United were clearly not the favourites to win today,\" he previously said.",
      "He added: \"But they played with total commitment and skill and overcame one of the great teams in football. We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them.\"",
      "However, comments about not being favourites highlighted just how much of an uphill battle Project 150 – which aims to see United win the Premier League by 2028 in line with its 150th anniversary – would be. The club's recent performances, including a record-low eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 season and a dreadful 2024/25 campaign in the Premier League, have highlighted the significant challenges they face in closing the gap with their rivals.",
      "Despite the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, the team continues to languish near the bottom of the table, on track for their worst-ever Premier League finish. And while Amorim has shown glimpses of promise, such as dragging the team to the Europa League final where they face fellow Premier League strugglers Tottenham, it is clear that he needs time to adapt and shape the squad to his playing style.",
      "\"You've got to be brave or foolish to think winning the league by 2028 is doable from where United currently are.\"",
      "It has been 12 years since Sir Alex Ferguson departed Manchester United, and the club has struggled to replicate his success in the Premier League since then.",
      "The current state of the team suggests that it will be a long and challenging journey to return to the top of English football. Old Trafford has seen a parade of managers, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ten Hag and now Amorim, all attempting to reverse the club's fortunes. But instead, they've seemingly slipped further down the league table.",
      "Another hurdle is the Premier League's PSR rules and regulations. In the January transfer window, United were only able to secure the services of Patrick Dorgu for £25million and promising Arsenal youngster Ayden Heaven, while Marcus Rashford, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia were sent out on loan.",
      "If United can arrange permanent moves for these players, and if Chelsea decide to splash out £20m for Jadon Sancho following his loan stint at Stamford Bridge, it could help ease the club's substantial debts. As of March, the club was reported to be in debt to the tune of £733m, with an additional £315m owed in outstanding transfer fees."

      "When Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al Nassr midway through the 2022-23 season, the expiry of his bumper contract was the last thing on most people's minds. Now, though, the imminent end of his deal has left plenty of questions over the Portuguese.",
      "Ronaldo has continued to score for fun in the Saudi Pro League, but hasn't delivered the trophies his current club had hoped for when bringing him in from Manchester United. It's time for the Riyadh side to stick or twist, and Ronaldo's wages may tempt them towards the latter.",
      "Of course, the player himself is far from ready to retire. He remains part of the Portugal international picture, missing just one competitive match in the last 18 months, and has a World Cup on the horizon in 2026.",
      "\"I just want to enjoy. Plan for the retirement… if it has to happen, in one or two years… I don’t know,\" Ronaldo said in 2024. \"I’m turning 40 soon… I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going. The day I don’t feel motivated, I will retire”.",
      "Upon signing for Al Nassr, Ronaldo indicated he wouldn't be returning to club football in Europe. \"\"I did my mission in Europe well and achieved everything. Now it's time for a new challenge in Asia,\" he said.",
      "The offer of a return to Sporting might change that, though. He was a teenager when he left his home in Madeira to join the Lisbon club, and it's there that he made his senior debut.",
      "Despite a dramatic slump when Ruben Amorim left for Manchester United, Sporting have secured a return to the Champions League. Victory in their final league game will see them crowned champions, and a return for the prodigal son could make for a very interesting summer.",
      "If Ronaldo feels he has settled in Saudi Arabia, Al Ahli might be the solution. Matthias Jaissle's side won the AFC Champions League Elite this season, beating league rivals Al Hilal along the way, and will defend their title next season.",
      "The Jeddah club are also likely to have space in their squad for a big-name arrival over the summer. Roberto Firmino has had an up-and-down time at the club, and is expected to return to Brazil.",
      "A bigger issue, of course, is how Ronaldo might gel with Ivan Toney. The England international has top-scored for the club this term, and much may hinge on whether he feels he needs to return to Europe to earn a chance of making Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad - and wether he cares enough to do that.",
      "Speaking of Premier League stars of yesteryear who have endured goal droughts in so-called 'lesser' leagues... Olivier Giroud joined LAFC from AC Milan last summer, but went 10 league games without scoring in his first half-season.",
      "He opened his MLS account in April, after a couple of strikes in cup competitions, but the return is probably some way short of what the California club would have expected from the Frenchman's elevated Designated Player pay-packet. If they're able to get the veteran off their books, might another elder statesman take his place?",
      "Of course, the biggest selling point of a move for Ronaldo is a chance to reignite his one-time La Liga rivalry with Inter Miami's Lionel Messi, only this time across the Atlantic. It wouldn't be exactly the same as in those Clasico years, but fans who weren't able to witness those matches first-hand may well be pleased just to see the pale imitation.",
      "A Premier League return for Ronaldo remains unlikely, and a third Manchester United stint all but impossible. If he were to return to England, though, Chelsea might be bold or foolish enough to take the plunge.",
      "The Blues' transfer policy has focused predominantly on a younger profile of player, but there have been times this term when a lack of experience was telling. If a near-40-year-old Thiago Silva could do the job last term, why not a 40+ Ronaldo?",
      "We wouldn't even be entertaining the idea if Chelsea had a settled and consistent front-line, but the cupboard looks rather bare when you take out Nicolas Jackson. A summer exit for Christopher Nkunku would free up a bit of space, leaving them with someone ready to step in and share line-leading duties at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Ronaldo's return to Manchester United in 2021 came with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the helm. It might be a long shot, but a reunion with the Norwegian boss at Besiktas could end up tempting Ronaldo this summer.",
      "While Ronaldo found it harder to earn regular minutes under Erik ten Hag, he was United's top scorer in that first season under Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. Besiktas' top scorer this season, Ciro Immobile, only has one more year left on his own deal and missed periods with hamstring trouble earlier in the season, so the Super Lig club may be tempted to see if the funds are there for Ronaldo.",
      "There is, of course, the small matter of the Istanbul side missing out on a top-two finish this term. Would Ronaldo return to Europe without the promise of Champions League football?"

      "Bruno Fernandes will not allow his critics to tell him how to captain of Manchester United.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder splits opinion on how he goes about his business at Old Trafford - and former players like Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have been scathing in their assessment of the 30-year-old. But Fernandes will lift his third trophy as United skipper if Ruben Amorim’s team beat Tottenham in the Europa League final - and team-mate Diogo Dalot insists his countryman will always do it his way.",
      "Dalot said: “Bruno has been showing all his career the leader that he is, especially on the pitch. Even outside the pitch, he always tries to lead by example. I think this is the type of example we should always follow because the club needs more players like him.",
      "“I think Bruno always tries to be the best version of himself. I don’t think it is necessarily because of what people said about him.",
      "“I just know that he is a big personality, so he knows what advice to take and what advice not to take. He is an experienced player, so I think he is big enough to understand what is best for him or not.",
      "“Everybody at United is pleased to have him. He tries to make everyone feel comfortable around the club, especially the new signings and I think everyone likes to be around him because he is so special.",
      "“You can spend time with him, you can ask for help, he can help you in every aspect that you need - and that is what a great leader does.”",
      "Dalot also back manager Amorim despite his frequent criticism of his players. He said: “Don’t get me wrong, the manager is a nice guy - but when he has to give a stick to everybody, he gives a stick.",
      "“He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. I think you saw that since he came that he has his own ideas, he will not change for anybody because he thinks he is best for the club - and I can guarantee you it is the best for the club."

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot insists that Ruben Amorim’s honesty is the best policy for the club.",
      "Amorim has been brutally realistic about the quality of the squad he inherited six months ago - and the magnitude of the task he's facing. The 40-year-old has even questioned whether the job is too big for him, with the Reds set for their worst league finish for 50 years despite the prospect of still qualifying for the Champions League by beating Tottenham in Wednesday night’s Europa League Final in Bilbao.",
      "Now Dalot has lifted the lid on Amorim’s style - and has promised the fans that the good times will return once United have ridden out the storm. Dalot, who believes he is winning his fight to be fit to face Spurs, said: “Personally it hurts a lot when the manager says what he’s said.",
      "“But it is just something he is really honest about. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He doesn’t hide the type of communication he wants to express - and that makes him an honest guy, an honest person.",
      "“It is really hard these days to find managers and players like him. But if it hurts you, it’s a good sign because it means you want to change things. He is speaking about my team, my team-mates, my club. I don’t want to hear my manager and anybody else around the club feeling like that.",
      "“So what can I do to change that? That is what I focus on the most. I try to evolve as many team-mates as many people as I can into having the same energy - but then you have to fight.",
      "“It is obviously something the club will address, the players have to address also. We have to look at ourselves and see what can I change to be better and try to get in the same pattern that the manager wants.”",
      "Dalot, 26, has seen Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag all fail where Amorim hopes to succeed in the seven years he has been at Old Trafford following his £19million arrival from Porto.",
      "Amorim arrived with a big reputation in November after winning two titles in four seasons at Sporting Lisbon. But his determination to impose the same playing style in Manchester that served him so well at the Estadio Jose Alvalade has been a tough transition.",
      "Dalot insists his countryman will live or die by his beliefs - and rubbished suggestions that Amorim is too nice to be a winner in the Premier League.",
      "The full-back also reckons that the manager’s gesture in buying tickets for the Bilbao final for members of staff who had been told by the club that they would have to pay their own way is typical of his leadership style.",
      "Dalot, who is battling to shake off a hamstring problem, said: “Don’t get me wrong, the manager is a nice guy - but when he has to give a stick to everybody, he gives a stick.",
      "“He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. I think you saw that since he came that he has his own ideas, he will not change for anybody because he thinks he is best for the club - and I can guarantee you it is the best for the club.",
      "“It will take a little bit of time. Everybody made a headline when he came about the big storm we needed to go through but that is what we are facing now and we will get through it and people will look back to this time as something that was big for the club.",
      "“We just have to keep building because I believe together we will do great things. The manager showed how much he wants to keep the club united by literally paying to make sure everybody will be together at the final.",
      "“I think it is an amazing gesture. It could have easily been all the players doing it but by doing it by himself it is so incredible.”"

      "Manchester United stand to profit if Andreas Pereira leaves Fulham this summer. The Brazilian midfielder has just one year left to run on his current deal at Craven Cottage at the end of the season, though Marco Silva's side have a one-year extension option.",
      "Fulham have been keen to tie down Pereira to improved terms but the 29-year-old is thought to be open to a new challenge and will explore all possible options in the coming months.",
      "Nottingham Forest and Marseille are among his admirers while Brazilian side Palmeiras were hot in pursuit of the playmaker in January. The South American giants are believed to have had two bids rebuffed.",
      "However, if Fulham do decide to consider offers for Pereira, United could earn some much-needed bonus cash. The Red Devils have a 20 per cent sell-on clause after selling the Belgian-born starlet to Fulham in September 2022 for an initial £8million plus £2m in bonuses.",
      "Speaking to Opta in March, Pereira revealed he wants to prove United made a mistake in selling him whenever he plays at Old Trafford. He said: “I don’t think I got my full chance to play and show my quality when I was there. Fulham gave me that opportunity, they did everything for me, and I want to do everything for them. So, whenever I play at Old Trafford, I want to show that United made a mistake.”",
      "Fulham must win at Brentford on Sunday to keep their European qualification hopes alive. Boss Silva has repeatedly outlined his commitment to the west Londoners in recent weeks amid links to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "Silva has already made ambitious transfer plans with the Fulham hierarchy ahead of the summer window and Pereira remains a key part of his squad. However, if Pereira expresses a desire to leave, they're unlikely to stand in his way.",
      "Back in December, the ex-United man was dropped from the Fulham squad to face Tottenham after his comments during a foreign media interview appeared to get lost in translation.",
      "It was initially conveyed that he was frustrated that a switch to French side Marseille collapsed last summer, however, moving to clarify for the ordeal - Pereira was keen to highlight he was happy at Fulham.",
      "He wrote on social media: \"I would like to address the article recently published about me. Unfortunately, the piece contains statements attributed to me that I did not make, and the translation into English was done in a malicious and inaccurate manner, completely distorting my words.",
      "\"In the interview, I clearly expressed my happiness and satisfaction with being at Fulham and my gratitude for everything the club and the staff have done for me, emphasising at all times that I still have two years remaining on my contract and that I am fully focused on the club.",
      "\"However, the article includes comments that are neither accurate nor reflective of what I actually said. I deeply regret the unprofessional conduct displayed in this situation and respectfully request a retraction of the quotes falsely attributed to me.\""

      "Brian McClair believes the definition of what constitutes Manchester United's DNA can be captured in three simple words - class, humility, dignity.",
      "The former Scottish international striker, who spent 11 years at Old Trafford while Sir Alex Ferguson was restoring the standards first laid down by Sir Matt Busby, has warned that until the Reds rediscover their identity then the lifeblood of the club will continue to drain away.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the latest manager to be tasked with getting the Stretford End arising - and McClair believes a comparison can be made between the club he arrived in the summer of 1987 and the one that now finds itself on a precipice.",
      "United will finish in their lowest league position for half a century - yet still have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League by beating Tottenham in Wednesday night’s Europa League Final.",
      "McClair doesn’t accept that Amorim’s fate hinges on the result in Bilbao. But he does feel that the result will have huge ramifications on the time it’s going to take for the glory years to truly return.",
      "“I can’t say I’ve enjoyed watching United this season but the one oasis in the very dry desert has been the Europa League,” said McClair, who joined a club that had not been champions for 20 years when he arrived from Celtic for £800,000 and went on to win four title medals, two FA Cups, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup after Ferguson was handed both time and money.",
      "“I’m even reluctant to say they have played well on the road to the final because I think that they’ve enjoyed a lot of good fortune.",
      "“I’m pretty sure that even if United lose against Spurs it will have no bearing on whether Amorim is still the manager next season.",
      "“But as far as transfer business is concerned, I would imagine they have got two different plans based on whether they win or lose.",
      "“Qualification for the Champions League is worth upwards of £100million and that will have an effect on both the budget and the quality of the players United will be able to attract.",
      "“Players will always want to come to Manchester United. But can they afford these players if they’re not in the Champions League or will they be forced into a cheaper market?”",
      "McClair became the first United player since George Best to score 20 league goals in a season during his first year at Old Trafford - and Ferguson’s team came second to Liverpool.",
      "But the next two campaigns saw the Reds finish 11th and 13th as the Scot sold fan favourites like Norman Whiteside and Paul McGrath in a ruthless cull that McClair believes has echoes of the way Amorim has made it clear that players like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are finished.",
      "Winning the FA Cup in 1990 and the European Cup Winners Cup a year later became the springboard for an unparalleled period of United success. McClair said: “There are definitely comparisons to be made between now and what happened when Fergie arrived.",
      "“Defeats, lowly league positions - and then a welcome cup run to a final. In 1990, it was the FA Cup. Now it’s the Europa League. What also intrigues me is the way Amorim has gone about restoring discipline inside the dressing room.",
      "“He’s been very candid about what he thinks. He’s made it clear that he’s in charge and that he will set the tone. I can see comparisons to Fergie in the way that Amorim is imposing his authority on the club.”",
      "McClair added: “Manchester United’s DNA is all about class, humility and dignity. It goes all the way back to when Sir Matt Busby took over after the Second World War. Players, managers and staff have a responsibility, irrespective of whether the club is having success or not, to be an ambassador for certain values.",
      "“The fabric of United has been lost since Alex Ferguson left and I suspect that Amorim recognises that and is doing what’s needed to restore things that used to be non-negotiable.",
      "“Fergie made it clear that you had to be special to play for Manchester United. That meant being a good player, or course, but he also made it clear that you had to be someone who was capable of carrying the mantle of all that history.”",

      "Noussair Mazraoui has cut out fizzy drinks from his diet, a self-imposed measure. He misses a soft drink at dinner and will treat himself if Manchester United win the Europa League final.",
      "Mazraoui was the most frugal of United’s five summer signings for an up-front fee of £12.8m. He has also been the most effective.",
      "Beyond Bruno Fernandes and Amad, Mazraoui has been the most consistent performer in the United squad. His availability has been so remarkable he required a corrective procedure after experiencing heart palpitations and did not miss a game.",
      "“That's a long time ago, it feels like ages ago,” Mazraoui says. “Everything was just fine. It was like nothing big or huge, nothing mention-worthy.”",
      "Mazraoui knew he had to make adjustments to his conditioning for his maiden season in English football. He feels the benefit, as much as he may miss some fizz. Mazraoui played a minimum of 40 games in only one season before he joined United. He has broken the 50 barrier this season.",
      "Until his breather at Brentford, Mazraoui had started in 13 successive matches. He only managed 15 Bundesliga starts for Bayern last season. In the Premier League, it is more than double that. A trophy would provide a sweet finale for a player who has deprived Mazraoui’s system of sugar.",
      "“To be honest, I'm surprised that you're telling me that I played in seven positions,” Mazraoui says. “I didn't know that.”",
      "You can’t blame Mazraoui for not counting. For those who have been: right centre back, left centre back, right back, left back, right wing, left wing and, most curiously, as the No.10.",
      "Rangers at home marked his sole enforced absence, through illness. Ruben Amorim has fretted about Mazraoui’s fitness in recent weeks and his importance could be gauged by his absence from the squad at Brentford.",
      "“Being in a season where you win everything, you come into a kind of flow where you can kick me, I will not feel it,” Mazraoui shrugs. “But when you lose a lot of games, you just give me a little step on my toes and you're in a lot of pain. It's a big difference.",
      "“It's a long season, like I said. It's the end of the season, so of course, physically, after playing so many games, I didn't do that quite often in my career, so of course you're going to feel it a little bit in the body.",
      "“I think the biggest example is Lyon, where we were almost dead in the last ten minutes of the game. Extra time, everybody's tired and everything, and you still manage to win.”",
      "Mazraoui has ping-ponged from right to left this season and his activity during United’s Europa League media day is similar. Mazraoui has to walk the breadth of the Stretford End to fulfil media engagements on Wednesday, inside and outside.",
      "By the time he stops to speak for an interview scheduled for 1pm, it is nearly 3.45pm. That is the sheer demand for one of United’s ever-presents.",
      "As one of the interviewees for the final, Mazraoui is a certainty to start. It is still unclear where yet the spate of centre back injuries suggest he would be a logical inclusion at right centre back.",
      "His relocation there could be permanent next season. “I have some qualities which fit perfectly with the position,” he explains. “Like in the right centre-back, I really like to go forward with the ball. So in the build-up and break the lines, that's something I can do good. So I'm comfortable on the ball.",
      "“But it's not like attacking as wing back. And wing back, a lot of times you come in a right wing position. For that, you really need like Amad one-v-one skill. That's maybe not my biggest strength.",
      "“So on both positions, you know some good points and some points which you feel like, ‘okay, maybe it's better to play in another position’.”",
      "Like everyone, Mazraoui suffered teething issues in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system. Mazraoui was recruited as a specialist right back capable of filling in on the left and, as an Ajax-schooled talent, his instinct is to attack.",
      "Under Amorim, it is markedly different for the defender. “In the beginning, some things were not like going automatically. So instead of going forward, you had to go on the break and stay in your position.",
      "“So some things were different. But eventually, now after a couple of months, this system, everybody knows what to do and how to do it.”",
      "Ten Hag reunited with Mazraoui two years after they both left Ajax in the same summer. Ten Hag gave Mazraoui his debut and the Moroccan played 150 times under the former United manager before he was sacked in October. The pair are still in touch.",
      "In Ten Hag’s penultimate match, he picked Mazraoui as the No.10 in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce. That was a surprise to almost everyone, including Mazraoui. “Yeah, it was a surprise. Not something I didn't do. I did it a really long time ago, before that moment.",
      "“I've always been quite good with Erik. It's not that I talk to him every week. I just texted him maybe one or two times more personally, like, how are you as a person, because it's not only about football.",
      "“You’re never happy with [a manager’s sacking], of course. Getting a manager sacked is always a feeling of disappointment. You feel it as a player as well.",
      "“So yeah, really, I was not happy with that. I was disappointed with that in myself and everybody else was as well, I think. So yeah, that was not the most happy part.”",
      "United have revelled in their Europa League commitments yet a Premier League side await in the final. Mazraoui started in all three defeats to Tottenham, trophyless since 2008.",
      "It is a dicey dynamic for the Premier League’s worst teams bar the sinking ships in the relegation zone. United have the trophy-winning nous and the pedigree yet Spurs are unbeaten in six matches against them.",
      "“Tottenham brings a lot of intensity in their games,” Mazraoui says. “We've seen this already this season. We've played, I think, already three times against them. So yeah, that's, I think, their biggest quality, that they bring so much intensity and pressing in everything, what they do.",
      "“Winning a trophy is never easy. I think in any case you don't downgrade that, because you have to fight hard to get into the position to win a trophy. You have to beat opponents who are strong and who are also really hungry to be in that final.",
      "“Eventually, I think if you look at the end of your career and you look back at your career, you will look back at this season you're going to be proud of winning if we win on Wednesday, of winning the Europa League, more than you're going to look at eventually at the failure in the Premier League. You can be, for sure, proud.”",
      "Are Tottenham’s wins against United relevant? “No, I don't think so. Because this is like a whole different competition. It's Europa League, it's a final, so the context around it is so different that you cannot really compare any games, any previous games with this final.”",
      "Amorim was at a loss to explain United’s Jekyll-and-Hyde form in the Premier League and Europa League. Manuel Ugarte, the last of the summer recruits, opined that the main difference was the physicality.",
      "Mazraoui pinpoints a more glaring issue. “Out of two chances in every Europa League, we score a minimum one. Out of the 20 chances we get in the Premier League, we don't manage to score one. That's the biggest difference.",
      "“So I don't think that has something to do with the league. I don't think that the goalkeepers in the Europa League are that much worse than in the Premier League, so yeah, that's the biggest difference.”",
      "That Dutch bluntness (Mazraoui was born in the Netherlands and retains a Dutch accent) thickens Mazraoui’s skin to withstand Amorim’s candour. He has no issue with some of the Portuguese’s diatribes.",
      "“I like him a lot in that [respect]. He's really honest, really straightforward, he's not hiding from anything,” Mazraoui enthuses. “No (it’s not hard to hear the criticism), for me personally not, because that's how I am as well.",
      "“I'm not hiding behind anything, and that's the manager as well. He takes responsibility, he knows he's the head of the club, eventually, because he's the manager. That's something I like a lot about him because I’m like that as well.”",
      "Mazraoui was involved in three Ajax title-winning sides and lifted the Meisterschale shield that is awarded to the German champions. His winners’ medals are on display at his home, offering daily motivation.",
      "If he gains another one next week, it may be soaked in fizz."

      "Ruben Amorim's brutal honesty about Manchester United's dismal season is turning the Old Trafford dressing room into a more emotional and vulnerable environment, according to defensive stalwart Diogo Dalot.",
      "The Portuguese head coach hasn't sugar-coated United's woes since he arrived. A record of just six wins in 26 Premier League games highlights the depth of the club's domestic struggles.",
      "In January, he branded this the worst United side in history, and after the club's defeat to West Ham a week ago, he didn't hold back in revealing his own concerns and the fear that he could be sacked if he can't turn the club's fortunes around quickly.",
      "That isn't in danger of happening, with Amorim maintaining the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has someone who also shoots from the hip and admires Amorim's honest appraisals. But Dalot said seeing the 40-year-old so clearly suffering was hurting the players, while also encouraging them to show how much it is hurting them as individuals.",
      "\"Personally, it hurts a lot, especially not being able to be on the pitch, it hurts even more,\" said Dalot. \"But it is just something he is really honest about.",
      "\"He doesn’t hide his emotions. He doesn’t hide the type of communication he wants to express. And that makes him an honest guy, an honest person.",
      "\"That is really hard nowadays to find, managers and players that don’t go through what you are supposed to say or are supposed to feel. It just becomes natural. And I think being and seeing him like that, it makes you want to be exactly like that. If it hurts you, it is a good sign because you want to change things.\"",
      "Amorim has taken the blame for United's woes this season on his own shoulders, constantly placing his own job in the spotlight and taking responsibility for the run of results.",
      "\"Even if I don’t feel like that, it still hurts to say because he is speaking about my team, my teammates, my club,\" said Dalot. \"I don’t want to hear my manager and anybody around the club feeling like that.",
      "\"So what can I do to change that? That is what I focus on the most. I try to evolve as many team-mates as many people as I can into the same energy and then you have to fight. It is obviously something the club will address, the players have to address also. We have to look at ourselves and see what can I change to be better and try to get in the same pattern everyone should be.\"",
      "Dalot talks warmly about his fellow Portuguese and the attitude and approach he has brought to the job, but he insists he does have the edge and the anger required to succeed in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "\"Don’t get me wrong, he is a nice guy, but when he has to give a stick to everybody, he gives a stick. He isn’t afraid to say what he thinks,\" he said.",
      "\"I think you saw that since he came that he has his own ideas, he will not change for anybody. Because he thinks he is best for the clu,b and I can guarantee you it’s the best for the club. It will take a little bit of time.",
      "\"We see him as he is. When he is happy, he is happy; when he is angry he makes sure everybody knows he is angry. We just have to keep building because I believe together we will do great things.",
      "\"Everybody made a headline when he came about the big storm we needed to go through but that is what we are facing now and we will get through it and people will look back to this time as something was big for the club.\"",
      "Amorim put his hand into his own pocket to fund tickets and travel to Bilbao for family members of his backroom staff, a gesture Dalot said showed how much he cares.",
      "\"It shows how much he wants to keep the club united and keep everybody on the same page and how much he is willing to, in this case literally, pay to be able to everybody be together,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it is an amazing gesture, in my opinion. It could have been easily all the players doing it but just him by himself trying to have that relationship is something incredible.\"",
      "For all of United's domestic struggles, they have impressed in Europe and travel to Bilbao this week, targeting the Europa League trophy and qualification for the Champions League.",
      "They are unbeaten in 14 European matches and have scored 19 goals in six knockout games against Real Sociedad, Lyon, and Athletic Bilbao, but they face domestic opponents in Tottenham in the final.",
      "Dalot is second most-used United player this season but hasn't featured for a month after picking up a hamstring injury and is in a race against time to be fit for the final.",
      "\"At this stage I have to go day by day to see how I am feeling every day but so far so good,\" he said.",
      "\"It is part of the job. I wouldn’t think in these last two years [when he has played nearly every game] a time like this would arrive. After playing so many game it was a sign probably that the body needed a little bit of a rest but I am working really hard to come back as soon as possible.\""

      "Come Tuesday morning at Carrington, the expectation is that Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt will be absent when the Manchester United players stroll out onto the training pitch.",
      "Ruben Amorim is remaining coy on their potential availability but both are long shots. Yoro was crestfallen as he limped down the touchline against West Ham United last Sunday. De Ligt has played once since April 1 and did not finish the first half at Brentford.",
      "Diogo Dalot was spotted at Carrington on Wednesday, walking back to the first team's temporary quarters after an individual session with physio Jordan Reece. While his teammates were training, a topless Dalot sat down and recuperated in the sunshine just outside the hub.",
      "He then hot-footed it over to Old Trafford to speak in a ramshackle mixed zone. Dalot posed for his Europa League final portrait in one of the stadium's hospitality suites. The hunch is that he will be in Bilbao and his name on the teamsheet, filed among the substitutes.",
      "Luke Shaw was a predictable removal at Chelsea on Friday night. Having gone 14 months without starting for United, he seems assured of starting the Europa League final.",
      "Seeing out the contest in Bilbao could be beyond Shaw. That is where Dalot could come in. Shaw off, Dalot on and Noussair Mazraoui to centre back.",
      "Mazraoui will start against Tottenham Hotspur. Amorim has picked him at centre back and right wing in the past two games, weighing up where exactly to put Mazraoui. United's starting XI at Chelsea could feasibly be the same side that lines up for the unmemorable Europa League anthem.",
      "Amorim is pleased with United's preparations, if not their domestic results. \"Yes, first of all because of the feeling, I didn’t like the feeling of the last game.",
      "\"Then we have five days to prepare for the game, it’s two days to fully recover, we can see video, prepare some things one day to compete. If I put some players out, it was like ten days without a game, I don’t like that.",
      "\"I think the best way to prepare for a final when you have time to fully recover and prepare for the next game is just to compete. And we are Manchester United so we need to compete in every game.\"",
      "The five-day gaps afford United ample recovery time and rhythm. Enzo Maresca was struck by United's man-to-man aggression against Chelsea and they were competitive for at least an hour. Yet United still ended the evening with one attempt on target.",
      "Amorim has agonised over a pragmatic or proactive approach ever since his first training session with the players on November 18. Alejandro Garnacho started in his 14th successive match last week but the return of Amad and prominence of Mason Mount could reduce him to a bench berth.",
      "Tottenham are deprived of two of their most creative talents in James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. There has been chatter that Ange Postecoglou could start a conservative trio of midfielders in Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur, which possibly influenced the redeployment of Bruno Fernandes as a central midfielder at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes were paired together at Tottenham in February with Manuel Ugarte out injured. That was Casemiro's first start in 48 days and back when his selection was dreaded by United supporters. He has gone from unplayable to undroppable in Europe.",
      "Amorim has spoken before of having Amad \"closer to goal\" and it is probable he will remain as one of the two number 10s. Mazraoui is more comfortable in a back three as it is somewhat similar to right back yet is poised to continue on the right wing, possibly to adjust the balance if Fernandes is in midfield.",
      "That throws up the peculiar pick of the great survivor, Victor Lindelof. Lindelof's United career effectively ends in a week but he is set to be one of three survivors from United's starting XI in the 2021 Europa League final. Shaw and Fernandes are the others.",
      "One could measure the severity of United's decline by the possible presence of Lindelof and Harry Maguire in a 2025 final XI. Those two defenders last signed contracts with United in August and September of 2019. Maguire has earned his extension. Lindelof hasn't.",
      "No wonder eyes are peeled for Yoro and De Ligt on Tuesday."

      "Before this week's Europa League final, Patrick Dorgu will find a quiet time to pray and hope that his middle name delivers to bring him a first senior medal and provides some salvation for Manchester United's season.",
      "Dorgu, a £25million January signing from Lecce, will be playing in his first major final after becoming Ruben Amorim's first signing at Old Trafford. As a left-footed wing-back, he is a key component in the Portuguese’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "The switch to the Premier League from a Serie A side who ended up getting relegated was a big step up for the Dane, but his religion has helped him and it went under the radar in March when he asked United to add his name to the official documentation, making him Patrick Chinazaekpere Dorgu on club and Premier League communications.",
      "Although he was born in Copenhagen, he is proud of his Nigerian heritage. His middle name, which stems from his Igbo heritage from the land of his family, means God answers prayers, and he will be hoping he does just that in Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "“My family are religious and the reason they gave me that name was because of the meaning behind it,\" said Dorgu. “They told me at a young age what it meant. It comes from my Igbo heritage.",
      "“My family’s culture is something I learned about. I believe in God and I am always praying. I hope we win the final - it’s what I am praying for.”",
      "Dorgu might be a quiet presence around the United dressing room as he settles at the club, but he is multilingual. He speaks Danish and English, learnt some Italian during his time at Lecce, and speaks Ebo - a historical name from the Igbo language native to people from south eastern Nigeria - to his family, including his two brothers and two sisters.",
      "His faith might have helped him since making the move to United. Dorgu has had a mixed start to life at Old Trafford, but he knew arriving mid-season at a club having a testing campaign was going to present its own challenges.",
      "“Obviously, I came there in a difficult moment (for the team), so I knew that nothing was going to be made easy for me,\" he said.",
      "“I’m getting better game by game, getting more confident so I hope I can improve even more in the last games of this season and in the seasons to come.",
      "“It is all about working hard, looking forward, believing in the coach and the players and to improve my game. It has been difficult but I think there will be a lot of good years coming up, so we just need to stay focused and win the final.\"",
      "The Europa League final might be a contest between the 16th and 17th best teams in the Premier League, but the stakes couldn't be higher. For one of the two clubs, a dismal domestic season will be glossed over by a European trophy and a seat in the Champions League. For the other, the summer will be dominated by inquests into their worst campaign in more than a generation.",
      "United have the trophy-winning pedigree, having won the FA Cup final in similar circumstances last season, while Spurs haven't lifted silverware in 17 years. But Ange Postecoglou's side have beaten United three times this season, including twice when Amorim was in the dugout.",
      "“Spurs are a dangerous opponent. They have beaten us three times already this season, so we can’t think it will be easy,\" said Dorgu.",
      "“They have beaten us twice in the league and once in the Carabao Cup, so it will be a tough game even though both teams haven’t been playing well. We just hope that we can get the win.",
      "“It would mean a lot to me and to the club and the players. Everyone is, not angry, but disappointed about this season so if we can win the Europa League it will be a boost.”"

      "Three goals in 33 games is bad enough but Rasmus Hojlund's body language, and the unrestrained reactions of his teammates and coaches, are just as disconcerting.",
      "Hojlund was complaining to Mason Mount, a sympathetic sounding board, in the second half at Chelsea. Mount offered an encouraging pat on the head and then exited the pitch. Hojlund was suddenly devoid of an ally.",
      "At full-time, Hojlund turned to his fellow Scandinavian Victor Lindelof and was complaining about something or other. Lindelof soon spotted Jadon Sancho and was one of a handful of United players who acknowledged him.",
      "The press box at Stamford Bridge is directly behind the dugouts, separated by maybe half-a-dozen rows of spectators. Ruben Amorim was particularly piqued with a Dane, though it was Patrick Dorgu. His assistant, Paulo Barreira, was most animated with Hojlund.",
      "Another Portuguese, Bruno Fernandes, berated Hojlund in each half. After Hojlund killed an attack, there was that familiar sigh from the United supporters. It was all-too-familiar fare from a striker who is being bracketed with Garry Birtles, Radamel Falcao and Wout Weghorst.",
      "The punchline is Hojlund is certain to start the Europa League final. That could be his swansong as the starting striker for United. Hojlund was always destined to fail, by association with Kees Vos and the inexplicably exorbitant £72million fee United agreed for him at 3am at Atalanta's training ground.",
      "Amorim seriously tried to suggest he is happy with Hojlund at Stamford Bridge. \"I’m happy. Of course, all the team has to improve, but the way he runs, he fights for every ball, loses a lot of duels, wins some duels, he needs to improve the connection.",
      "\"But he is improving. I’m really happy with him, he just needs to continue working hard and better things will come.\"",
      "In his question to Amorim, a colleague remarked that Hojlund's performance \"left a lot to be desired\". Amorim was never going to dispute that.",
      "Senior figures at United are not having Hojlund. One well-placed source suggested he does not work hard enough. They can cut loose as it is well-established that Hojlund will be replaced in the summer. Amorim, though strikingly frank about United's ills, can't.",
      "The coaching staff have been losing patience with Hojlund for some time. Teammates were hesitant about passing the ball to Hojlund last season and it has been more brazen this season.",
      "Off the pitch, Hojlund is so desperate for approval he is resorting to crass captions, clearly curated by a tone-deaf social media team, on Instagram posts for the banter brigade. All he succeeds in doing is imitating Neal Maupay, one of the worst strikers to ever get a kick in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system is geared to service the striker, so he was never going to entertain the prospect of picking a strikerless team after Joshua Zirkzee was ruled out for the rest of the season last month. Amorim confirmed on Easter Sunday that it would do no good to remove Hojlund from the team. He has stuck to his guns even as Hojlund continues to fire blanks.",
      "There have been two tap-ins since then and a fine performance at Athletic Bilbao, a man light for 55 minutes after Dani Vivian tugged at Hojlund’s shirt. But the Premier League is the truest gauge and Hojlund will be pitted against Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero back in Bilbao. That could be as much of a mismatch as two bouncers turning away an underage schoolboy from a nightclub.",
      "Erik ten Hag dropped Hojlund for United's final three games last season and it was a masterstroke. United won all three, climaxing with their best performance of the post-Ferguson era against City in the FA Cup final.",
      "Hojlund came on in all three wins, scoring against Newcastle United and Brighton before a constructive cameo at Wembley. He left the national stadium that evening swigging from a magnum of champagne.",
      "Gaining the number nine shirt in the summer reaffirmed United's long-term backing for Hojlund. Perhaps things might have been different had he not pulled his hamstring minutes after scoring against Arsenal in the otherworldly So-Fi Stadium in Los Angeles. Hojlund required another scan on the other side of the Atlantic as the first was inconclusive and he was out for eight weeks.",
      "Yet Hojlund has been at United for 22 months now and his first season was creditable. It was not unreasonable to expect or aim for an improvement on his 16 goals last season.",
      "Eleven of his 26 goals have come in the Champions League and Europa League. United have a surfeit of players better suited to European competition (Zirkzee, Dorgu Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to name but four). That is primarily why their supporters have been subjected to the worst United side since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "Tommy Docherty's main recruit that summer was Stuart Pearson. A striker. Hojlund's teammates and coaches seem to be pining for a different striker."

      "After Manchester United failed to win any of their opening three matches in the Europa League this season, few would have banked on them reaching the final in Bilbao.",
      "Despite taking the lead in all of their opening three league phase outings, United amassed a paltry three points from a possible nine, drawing with FC Twente (1-1), FC Porto (3-3) and Fenerbahce (1-1).",
      "The stalemate with Fenerbahce in Istanbul left United 21st in the league phase table. It also left Erik ten Hag clinging on to his job.",
      "Alongside making an underwhelming start to their Europa League campaign, United experienced a difficult start to their Premier League season. They won just three of their opening nine matches, leaving them 14th in the table.",
      "United's ninth game of their league campaign saw them beaten 2-1 by West Ham United at the London Stadium, just three days after they were pegged back by Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce.",
      "That defeat to the Hammers, which was United's fourth in their opening nine league games, marked the end of the road for Ten Hag, who was dismissed the following day, just months after Ineos decided to keep him.",
      "United, almost as soon as Ten Hag had cleared his office, were on the phone to Sporting Lisbon and attempting to convince Ruben Amorim to replace him. Despite the Portuguese chief being hesitant about moving to Old Trafford mid-season, United got their man, appointing him just four days after Ten Hag had been dismissed.",
      "As part of the agreement, Amorim stayed at Sporting until the November international break, meaning Ruud van Nistelrooy was placed in temporary charge.",
      "He won three of his four games at the helm, drawing the other, and it felt as though Amorim would pick up from where the Dutchman had left off. His short spell in charge did improve the mood in and around the club. It also saw United get their Europa League campaign up and running with a 2-0 win over PAOK at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Amorim's obsession with his trademark 3-4-2-1 system meant that teething problems were to be expected at the start of his tenure. After a solid first set of results saw United draw 1-1 at Ipswich Town, beat Bodo/Glimt 3-2 and brush Everton aside 4-0, United's supporters hoped the transition to Amorim's preferred system would be seamless.",
      "Amorim's warning about a storm being on its way soon came to fruition, though, and United started stumbling. The 2-1 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium was the only highlight in a forgettable December.",
      "However, despite the disappointment and frustrations of United's Premier League form, their results and performances in Europe have seen them reach the Europa League final. Wednesday night's clash with Tottenham Hotspur offers them the opportunity to salvage something from what has been a disastrous campaign.",
      "United head into the clash with Spurs boasting an unbeaten record in Europe this season, winning nine and drawing five of their 14 Europa League matches. They won each of the four league phase matches Amorim took charge of, ensuring they finished in an automatic qualification spot for the last-16.",
      "Despite being held to a draw in the first leg of their last-16 tie with Real Sociedad in Spain, they came from behind to make light work of them at Old Trafford in the second leg, winning 4-1 to seal a 5-2 aggregate triumph.",
      "Lyon were up next in the quarter-finals and United, as we all know, made hard work of that one. After the first leg finished 2-2 in France, United were heading for the exit in the second leg at Old Trafford, trailing 4-2 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate with just minutes to go.",
      "However, goals from Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire meant the Europa League dream remained alive. Maguire's dramatic header was perhaps a sign that it is simply meant to be for United in this competition.",
      "Athletic Bilbao, despite looking as though they would pose the sternest test United had faced in Europe all season, were blown away in the semi-finals. United won 3-0 in Spain and 4-1 at Old Trafford to progress to the final with a commanding 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Now, of course, they are one step away from winning a European trophy and securing a place back in Europe's premier club competition next season.",
      "Despite how poor their domestic form has been this season, supporters of other clubs in this country would kill to be in the position United will find themselves in on Wednesday evening.",
      "After the way in which this Europa League campaign started and a managerial alteration needing to be made just months into the season, United deserve credit for reaching a European final. Now they need to win it."

      "With just two games left to play, United's direction of travel in this summer's window could be dictated by the outcome of Wednesday night's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "Coming out on top at the San Mames Stadium will secure Champions League qualification for the Reds, meaning they will be much more attractive to prospective signings.",
      "Champions League qualification will also boost their transfer budget, offering Ruben Amorim more leverage to get his desired targets through the door.",
      "United plan to strengthen their squad this summer, meaning exits and arrivals are likely across various areas, and the midfield department is no exception. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United should be striving to complete to freshen up their midfield options.",
      "Following United's transition to a 3-4-2-1 system under Amorim last November, full-backs who previously played in a back-four have had to adjust.",
      "Two wing-backs flank two central midfielders in Amorim's preferred shape, meaning they are expected to attack just as much they are expected to get back and assist the three centre-backs.",
      "Of United's current pool of wing-backs, Tyrell Malacia, who is currently out on loan at PSV Eindhoven, is the only one the Reds should be actively striving to offload this summer. His eight appearances under Amorim after returning from a lengthy spell on the sidelines quickly proved that he is not effective enough as a wing-back.",
      "Malacia's career has been built on playing as a traditional full-back, operating on the left of a four-man defence. He does not have the attack-minded profile and athleticism to operate as a wing-back.",
      "He has not set the world alight out on loan at PSV, playing just 12 times since arriving in February, meaning offers might not be forthcoming. However, one way or another, United need to move him on.",
      "Elsewhere, United need to lower the average age of their central midfielders by offloading Christian Eriksen and Casemiro. Eriksen will be released when his contract expires and will leave the club after three seasons.",
      "He has often done a solid job when called upon, proving key to United's success in 2022/23, but the time has come for the two parties to go their separate ways.",
      "Despite his eye-catching performances in the Europa League, United should also be looking to try and cash-in on Casemiro. The Brazilian is now 33 and he has struggled to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League.",
      "United must sell him for £15million this summer to avoid a financial loss under profit and sustainability rules [PSR].",
      "Elsewhere, United should look to try and send Dan Gore out on loan for the season. He has left Old Trafford in the last two January windows, joining Port Vale and Rotherham United respectively, but both loan stints were derailed by injury issues.",
      "Highly-rated by United staff, Gore would benefit from a full season out on loan, earning regular game time.",
      "Following Harry Amass' promotion to the first-team squad this season, there is confidence he will be able to compete with and challenge Patrick Dorgu at left wing-back next season.",
      "On the opposite flank, however, United may need fresh legs. As good as Noussair Mazraoui has been this season, he is restricted in an attacking sense, meaning his long-term position under Amorim could be as a centre-back.",
      "If that proves to be the case, and Amad is utilised as one of the two No.10s, Diogo Dalot may need a competitor at right-sided wing-back. United do have players within their academy that are emerging who could play in that position, such as Jaydan Kamason, but they may feel they need someone more experienced to challenge Dalot.",
      "Dorgu can play at right wing-back, likewise Amad, meaning they do, at least, have options.",
      "In the centre, Manuel Ugarte has grown into his first season at Old Trafford, but he is yet to prove himself as the elite-level destroyer United thought they were buying. If Casemiro departs, he will need replacing with a younger operator and multiple midfielders have been linked with the club.",
      "Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton, who was linked with United before moving to London in January 2024, has excelled since making the switch to Selhurst Park. He is able to dictate games, progress the ball and win back possession.",
      "He would be perfect to help United continue evolving their midfield, but he will command a hefty price tag, with £60m having been reported as a possible fee. A player of his profile is exactly what United should be looking for.",
      "United may also make a case for trying to replace Eriksen with a younger operator. That, however, would likely be dependent on United finding a player who is happy to bide his time and develop before becoming a regular starter.",
      "Sunderland's Chris Rigg has been linked with Old Trafford and he is a player with enormous potential.",
      "However, Bruno Fernandes has demonstrated this season that he is very effective when playing in midfield, while Kobbie Mainoo is also capable of playing as a No.8, although his long-term position is yet to be determined.",
      "Wing-back options: Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Harry Amass, Jaydan Kamason, one new right wing-back.",
      "Central-midfield options: Manuel Ugarte, Adam Wharton, Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Chris Rigg."

      "Lindelof started against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and is likely to retain his starting role for United's biggest game of the season due to Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro having injuries.",
      "United will leave it late to decide on the fitness of De Ligt and Yoro. But even if either of the pair are given the green light to make the squad in Bilbao, they might not be fit enough to start and Lindelof is waiting in the wings.",
      "Yoro recently left Old Trafford without a protective boot after facing West Ham, which was seen as a positive sign, although De Ligt's situation just a few weeks earlier shows that might not necessarily mean good news.",
      "The bright side is that Yoro was spotted going into the gym at Carrington to do his own individual work earlier in the week, and Amorim initially said that he thought his issue was \"small.\"",
      "Yoro has improved each month during his debut season in Manchester and would be a nailed-on starter against Tottenham if he's fit enough to play. That remains to be seen, though.",
      "Lindelof is set to leave United upon the expiry of his contract at the end of the season. His deal expires officially on June 30 and starting him in the Europa League would not be ideal.",

      "Lindelof was supposed to leave Old Trafford last summer, but he sustained an injury in pre-season, which blocked his exit, and he returned to full training at Carrington in late September.",
      "The 30-year-old would have expected to be a peripheral squad member throughout this campaign, however, he has been needed to contribute in a handful of big games due to injuries.",
      "Lindelof has bags of experience and should be capable of filling in on the big stage, despite his contract situation. He arrived at United in the summer of 2017 and Luke Shaw is the only player in the dressing room who has been at the club for longer.",
      "This season was supposed to be low-key for Lindelof, but he has suddenly become important again and it's pretty staggering that he could start in another Europa League final for United.",

      "Upon his return to Manchester, Greenwood would hold meetings with the club's decision-makers where it was decided that a permanent transfer would be in the best interest to everyone involved. His permanent move to Marseille in 2024 saw United include a significant sell-on clause should the forward leave for a fee in the future.",
      "Greenwood has excelled in his first campaign in France, bagging 22 goals and six assists as Marseille finished second in Ligue 1 and qualified for next season's Champions League. The Bradford-born forward would become Ligue 1's joint top goalscorer alongside Ousmane Dembele on the final day after bagging a brace in the 4-2 victory over Rennes.",
      "With the season now at a close for Greenwood, the forward took the time to reflect on what he has achieved in his life after Old Trafford. \"From day one, this club welcomed me like family,\" he explained.",

      "In recent weeks, Greenwood has been linked with a move back to the Premier League.

      "Hojlund also didn't do enough sharp work on the ground, and one loose lay-off to Fernandes in the first half summed it up. He should have found the captain with time to play a forward ball to get United moving, but he left a simple pass short and Fernandes had to rush his pass, which was blocked.",
      "The midfielder glared at Hojlund as he retreated into shape and when the ball then went out of play, he rebuked United's No.9. It was another game that passed him by.",
      "He received the ball in a dangerous position during a good spell early in the second half, but was then ponderous in possession and the move broke down. A minute later, Fernandes was under pressure in midfield and had no out-ball. When he was dispossessed, he reacted furiously at Hojlund, who had been stationary rather than giving him an option.",
      "It was a reminder why a striker is right at the top of United's shopping list this summer, with £30million Liam Delap leading the race to lead the line next season.",
      "Onana gets away with one",
      "Enzo Fernandez would have been relieved to see the offside flag go up after he blazed over the rebound from Cole Palmer's shot late in the first half, but Andre Onana would also have been delighted to see Fernandez spoon his effort over the bar.",
      "Onana's save from Palmer's deflected shot looked spectacular, but it didn't need to be. The ball was spinning, and it looked like the goalkeeper got his timing wrong. In the end, he simply palmed the ball straight back into his six-yard box, presenting Fernandez with a big chance.",
      "Thankfully for Onana, the Argentine made a mess of it and the flag was up anyway, but it was a reminder of the little issues that continue to crop up in Onana's game.",
      "Maguire disappointed",
      "Harry Maguire has made a habit of popping up with late goals this season and has done a passable impression of a striker at times. He was still playing centre-back when he slammed in a half-volley from Fernandes' cross and then celebrated as if it was an everyday occurrence.",
      "You could tell it was a great goal and a superb strike from a player not noted for that sort of connection, because the United subs were on their feet and craning their necks to get a replay, with coach Adelio Candido in charge of the tablet.",
      "When that replay was viewed, it looked like Maguire might have been marginally offside. As VAR Craig Pawson reviewed the footage, Maguire looked over to the bench for information, and Amorim responded with a gesture that told him it was tight.",
      "Maguire probably knew what was coming next and his head slumped when he realised his sweet strike was being chalked off.",
      "Mount booing",
      "Chelsea fans gave Mason Mount a tougher time in his second return to Stamford Bridge than they did on his first game back last season, when he came on for the final four minutes of a madcap 4-3 defeat. Mount came on when United led 3-2 and walked off after they had contrived to throw the game away.",
      "The difference now is that he's in the best moment of his United career and returned not only feeling fit and in form, but with the chance to really stake a claim to start the Europa League final next week.",
      "So he was always likely to cop a bit more flak this time around, although in truth it doesn't really make a lot of sense. He left Chelsea for a good transfer fee and gave excellent service to the club. It's hard to see why they have such an issue with him.",
      "Away end",
      "It was another superb United away end in the capital, with the Shed End vista for visiting fans an excellent one these days at Stamford Bridge.",

      "United were comfortable winners and Onana, reflecting on that final, admitted the Reds had won the game in the tunnel.",
      "“We lost before the game was due to be played. Out of fear,\" said the current United number one who will start against Spurs with De Ligt hopeful of featuring but still an injury doubt.",
      "\"When we arrived in Stockholm I called Edwin van der Sar, I was not feeling well. I told him I didn’t want to play.",
      "“Edwin replied by saying I'm too old and didn’t bring gloves, you’re going to play.",
      "“Amin Younes came up to me in the tunnel. He was one of the most important players we had at the time. He was shocked by the size of the arms of his direct opponent, Antonio Valencia. He said: 'Phew, I can’t play against him.”",
      "“On the morning of the game, seven players were sick. We were still very young.”",
      "Onana and De Ligt will be hoping to be on the winning side in Bilbao this time around. The competition's importance to United has grown by the round this season and victory over Spurs would salvage a woeful campaign and hand Ruben Amorim's side a place in the Champions League.",
      "That is also the exact scenario facing Ange Postecoglou's men and sets up an intriguing contest that will be played with huge pressure on both sides.",
      "Onana, now 25, believes he has learned from the experiences of that 2019 final and hopes to be lifting the trophy come Wednesday night.",
      "“I lost against them so I have to win for them,\" he said speaking earlier this season. \"Now, we have a bit more experience. We know the competition. We can read the games. We know when to play long, when to play short, we can feel it.",

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",

      "Manchester Untied have reportedly put a shock ‘offer’ on the table to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa this summer, along with Barcelona.",
      "Martinez became the first goalkeeper to win the Yashin Trophy twice in October and has been a standout player for both club and country since his £15m move from Arsenal in the summer of 2020, helping Villa into the Champions League and winning both the World Cup and Copa America as Argentina’s No.1.",
      "But he’s been heavily linked with a move away of late and the 32-year-old was seen with tears in his eyes and waving to the fans at Villa Park after their key win over Tottenham on Friday night, suggesting it could be his last ever appearance at home for the Premier League side ahead of their crucial final day game against Manchester United at Old Trafford, which could be his new home.",
      "Responding to the footage of Martinez with tears in his eyes waving to the fans, Jamie Redknapp said it looked as though he was saying goodbye.",
      "Roy Keane added: “He’s been a good character. Obviously some people like him, he can be annoying sometimes – some of his antics – but he’s been a great signing and would be a big loss because it does look like he’s saying his goodbyes.”",
      "After the game, Villa boss Emery provided an update on the goalkeeper’s future: “We will see. Of course, it is the last match here [this season], and I don’t know. We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirmed previous reports after the game that “it could be his last appearance at Aston Villa”.",
      "He said: ‘Dibu Martinez, emotional at full time as this could be his last appearance at Aston Villa – not sure yet but a possibility ahead of summer window.",
      "‘Understand Saudi Pro League clubs have approached Martinez in the recent weeks.",
      "‘Emi Martinez will assess all the options also from Europe after Saudi Pro League clubs approaches, as he’s expected to leave Aston Villa.’",
      "But now a report from Argentinian outlet claims Martinez could yet stay in Europe, with Manchester United supposedly battling Barcelona for his signing.",
      "Hansi Flick is on the lookout for a long-term replacement for Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who’s missed most of this season through injury and hasn’t convinced besides, while Ruben Amorim has reportedly asked United chiefs to source an upgrade for Andre Onana, who’s made a number of high-profile errors this term.",
      "DSports claim ‘Emiliano Martínez has offers from Manchester United and Barcelona to leave Aston Villa’ this summer.",
      "Aston Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez should be ashamed. He ‘did not dive at all’ for the first PSG goal and committed an actual crime for the second.",

      "",
      "19) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nHe seems nice, doesn’t he? Glasner gives off the vibe that he doesn’t have a care in the world as long as the powers above just leave him to coach in peace.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle United)\nIt’s rare to see Howe lose his cool. He’s just a chill guy. And for that, we can’t praise him enough. Managing in the Premier League is a chastening experience, yet Howe makes it look like a walk in the park.",
      "That said, he’s not above the odd moan – but more often than not, he takes his medicine and moves on. A true modern-day stoic.",
      "",
      "17) Kieran McKenna (Ipswich Town)\nWe’re not ashamed to admit we’re not entirely sure if McKenna is a moaner or not, which probably means he’s not. Calm, composed and too well-raised to throw shade at referees. We suspect he apologises to fourth officials for blocking their view.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nThree-time Europa League winner Unai Emery is an animated manager, but not overly moany. He’s actually polite and respectful in interviews — and used to be mocked for it.",
      "",
      "15) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nUnited boss Amorim is more prone to self-loathing than anything else. If he moans, it’s about himself or his players being rubbish. It’s a refreshing change from his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, who would rather die than admit fault and still believes Alejandro Garnacho was onside because VAR used the “wrong angle”.",
      "Amorim may yet explode – it’s United, after all – but for now, his grievances are existential.",
      "",
      "14) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nPotter is a man slowly being lured to the dark side by the soul-sapping grind of managing West Ham United. And we can’t blame him. Reporters beware: he might still be polite, but he can swear if you want him to.",
      "",
      "13) Ruud van Nistelrooy (Leicester City)\nThere have been whispers of discontent – complaints about Caleb Okori’s boots, frustrations with players’ living arrangements and public criticism – but overall, Van Nistelrooy has kept a lid on things. He’s moaned, yes, but with humility. Leicester’s chaos hasn’t exactly helped.",
      "",
      "12) Pep Guardiola (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola is in a camp of his own as a very knowing, quite weird and extremely funny manager. He is unintentionally hilarious and we wouldn’t have it any other way.",
      "",
      "11) Thomas Frank (Brentford)\nWhen things don’t go his way, Thomas Frank is well accustomed to throwing his toys out of the pram. Generally, though, he’s pretty reserved and honest, and tends to give compelling answers in both pre- and post-match press conferences.",
      "",
      "10) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nIt’s been plain sailing for Slot in year one, but when the mask did slip – against Everton – it was spectacular. Even in defeat to PSG, he was almost serene. But four yellow cards suggest something’s simmering under the surface. Next season, we’ll see the real him.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nThere’s no hard evidence – but Pereira feels like a moaner. This season has gone well for him, which helps. But if Wolves had VAR go against them in a key game, you just know he’d throw the fourth official’s board into the stands.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nMaresca recently complained about the St James’ Park atmosphere influencing the referee, as if Nicolas Jackson hadn’t just elbowed Sven Botman in the head. Pick your battles, Enzo.",
      "His comments may have been more about the decisions that followed, and Maresca comes across more as a disciplinarian and standard-setter than a simple moaner.",
      "",
      "7) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nGet this man going, and it’s hard to stop him. Forest’s incredible season means Nuno hasn’t had much to complain about, but we all know he has it in him.",
      "",
      "6) David Moyes (Everton)\nMoyes might be more reserved and calm now he’s back at Everton, but there’s no doubt he still loves a good moan. It’s not always reporters who get the brunt of his frustration — sometimes it’s poor German ball boys. Nobody is safe when he’s in the mood.",

      "Hurzeler’s comments ensured the Gunners sleuths were ready to swarm at the first hint of hypocrisy. And they did just that. Their obsessive nature has kept the German’s moaning firmly in the social media spotlight — helping to propel him up this ranking.",

      "4) Ange Postecoglou (Tottenham Hotspur)\nBig Ange is ranked high, mainly because he despises Spurs fans and hates having to be Spurs manager. That results in a lot of moans, groans and passive-aggressive monologues in press conferences. His inconsistencies are part of the charm, though – ‘everyone’s human, mate’ becomes ‘the whole system is broken’ within a week.",

      "1) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nHere he is. The moaniest manager in the land.",
      "He’s been fined, racked up yellow cards, and delivered more fury than any manager outside the top six. And because he’s Fulham manager, it mostly goes under the radar. Not anymore.",

      "Man Utd lose to ‘Kavanagh FC’\nIn the money laundering cycle, I believe Chris Kavanagh tonight was what you’d call the washing part of the cycle. United 14 “fouls” and 6 yellows. Chelsea only 10 fouls (should have been plenty more) and 1 yellow for time wasting. Nothing for simulation, he did give Amad one despite a contact (never a penalty I’ll agree). But it’s not like the home fans are intimidating they only know how to sing their own name. He was given his orders. There were some positives for United to take in the first half but didn’t deserve to lose to Kavanagh FC.\nAnthony",

I’m also going to a 4 2 3 1 formation because it works for me on Football Manager and therefore is right.",
      "GK: I’m going to give Onana the nod, mainly due to bias, but if I was being a prick and not admitting to my bias, I’d probably make some vague claims about his form for Ajax and Inter and a loose point about United’s defence being an absolute shower of clowns",
      "RB: Mazraoui gets in because he has been an excellent addition, the sort of which we don’t make nearly enough of these days. A fully fit and in form James would obviously start, but as with Shaw at LB, this simply hasn’t been the case often enough",
      "CB: I haven’t watched much of Chalobeh so will just assume that F365 are right in saying he has been strong since coming in to the side",
      "CB: If I could stick VAR here I would as it seems to be the best hope of not conceding (certainly for United), but since we haven’t fully moved to AI yet, I’ll stick with Tosin",

      "CM: Bruno, can do everything. Also very likely the captain",
      "AM: Palmer has had a difficult second half of the season, but is a certain starter in my team (also a Manc which gives him bonus points)",
      "RW: Amad has really come on this season when given a chance, and I am firmly of the opinion that in a half decent side he would be even better",

Parades are also excellent for the city and businesses within it, the fact earthworm Jim doesn’t want to have one further exemplifies what a sh*t businessman he is that he doesn’t recognise it’s good for PR. Good for brand. Good for his business and local business and also brings some Levity to what has been a rough season for the Manchester tarts.",
      "That shouldnt be even the slightest bit controversial. You can both celebrate a trophy while also addressing the failings in the league.",
      "Second hot topic since United are in the final is whether it’s fair or not for a team finishing outside European qualifications to then get it for winning a trophy. Would Wenger et al also argue Palace shouldn’t get in Europe if they win the FA Cup? Or how about Seville when they won it and finished 12th that year? Or do these silly rules only apply to clubs we don’t like?",
      "I actually think cup wins should be given better access to Europe. It’s silly that 4th place gets a place in the Champions League but the team who wins the FA Cup doesn’t. All trophy wins should be rewarded with European football.",

It also makes those trophies more prestigious again and provides the winners with a financial bonanza because the £2m that the FA cup currently rewards isn’t even a months gate receipts for a top 10 club. It would also mean that more actual champions are in the champions league.",
      "If you think finishing 4th should be better rewarded than winning a trophy I think you miss the point of football. This season 5th place will get in..5TH! some of the other leagues in Europe don’t even get in if they win their league and we have 5th place getting in?",

      "Few reminisce 5 years down the line over that run to 4th if you don’t win the Champions League next year (only Liverpool have ever done that, maybe Chelsea too, no time to look) or if it is something you have done before and are reasonably expected to do. Winning a trophy is an amazing memory no matter how small – the day out, the one-off emotions of it all, the party afterwards, that’s what football is all about. That doesn’t always warrant an open bus top parade that shuts down a city though, and really it shouldn’t. Funnily enough, the hardest places to get permission are Manchester and London, go figure.",
      "Also all teams and councils aren’t the same, it comes down to relativity. United basically won trophies every single year, you have to apply to the council to have a parade and that comes with implications. So in their pomp, United only have parades for major trophies (Prem and Champs), since then, they’ve maintained that. It doesn’t mean there aren’t major fan celebrations in other forms, just not a parade that shuts down a city, requires policing, logistics with local authorities, road closures, permissions from businesses that require access, safety concerns, ambulances assigned, etc. Hopefully you get the point.",
      "Newcastle never win sh*t, Leeds and other teams likewise, so shutting down the city once every 25-100 years for a parade makes sense. In Manchester, there would be parades every single year with varying levels of interest/disinterest – look at City’s ‘turn-out’ for a treble lol.",
      "West Ham had a parade for the Intertoto cup, Portsmouth had a parade and were roundly mocked for reaching the FA cup final, Cardiff for finishing 2nd…. mocked, mocked, mocked. I’m sure United headlines would be full of capitalised EMBARRASSMENT and SHAME if they had a parade.",

      "Late offsides…\nA few thoughts on the ‘late offsides’ debate. I find this gets an unwarranted amount of airtime so I’ll give it some more",
      "It seems like the numerous proponents of this argument have been desperate for an injury in the few seconds of ‘meaningless play’ preceding a late flag that occur in most games to prove their point. It has now finally happened after a mere 5 years and nearly 2000 games of Premier League football demonstrating the likelihood of injury in this phase of play is extremely low.",
      "During this time there have been multiple other serious injuries some of which could have no doubt been avoided through more consistent refereeing of dangerous tackles and violent conduct or a reduction in the fixture burden. These seem like much more pressing issues.",
      "It would be very difficult to introduce a rule whereby the flag is raised for obvious offsides. In the Villa PSG game, Shearer was moaning about the flag going up late when Dembele went through, but went silent when the replays showed he was actually on. Even in the game in question, the offside looked more obviously than it was because elanga was almost at full pace and the defender was stepping up. If the ball was released a couple of milli-seconds earlier it would have been on.",
      "It would also create an imbalance whereby VAR is able to correct situations when the flag should have gone up but not when the flag went up but shouldn’t have for the most obvious errors, leading to less goals.",
      "Finally, the whole concept of a ‘meaningless period’ of play is a bit philosophical and hindsight driven. Most of the play in football is meaningless when you know what happens next. Towards the end of the season some entire games are meaningless and indeed some clubs have been meaningless throughout their entire history (Spurs). Why do people get so worked up by the max 5-10 seconds per game from late offside flags?\nWill AFC",
      "",
      "Time for a change…\nHere’s a wild idea for a Thursday afternoon that will grow the English game to new heights – Champions League playoffs. Hear me out.",
      "As someone who has never been comfortable with the idea of the Champions League containing teams who finished second, let alone fifth – these are not “Champions” people – I’ve always thought at least one of the additional spaced should be given to our domestic cup winners. That really would bring back the magic of the FA Cup and/or give the League Cup some relevance it’s never really had. Everyone always objects to this for perfectly good reasons, though often this boils down to “my team always finished in the top four so why should I vote for that?”. Arsenal fans basically.",
      "However, with every additional spot, the Premier League gets for the Champions League, the whole thing is becoming more and more that European Super League that we all said we definitely didn’t want (big fan of the new format though). Even with United and Spurs threatening not to compete in any sort of European football next season, they’ve both blundered their way to a final chance to win Big Cup next year. We need to do something about this nonsense.",
      "And then we have the everlasting spectre of playing meaningful games abroad. We don’t want it but the money men certainly do. Give them the Community Shield I used to say.",
      "Until now.",
      "What i propose, is that in the seasons where England gets a fifth Champions League spot, an end of season tournament is held to decide who gets it. Four teams vying for the same thing Arsenal win nearly every year without any actual hardware to show for it. In fact let’s lay a trophy on the line as well. (To be designed by the mailbox, naturally).",
      "To qualify, you must win the FA Cup, the League Cup or finish 5th or 6th. If the FA Cup or League Cup winners are in the top four then it’s extended to 7th. If both are in the top four then 8th gets a go too.",
      "As an example, if City win the FA Cup, this year’s playoffs would currently include Chelsea, Aston Villa, Forest and Brentford, Brentford beating Forest 4-0 in the final. Tell me that doesn’t sound like fun? This would give us 5 champions – Liverpool, Newcastle (league cup), City (FA Cup), Brentford (5th Place trophy) and Spurs (Europa League – United becoming #1 banter club in the process) – and Arsenal (trophyless but definitely “THE BEST TEAM” qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "This also gives Palace more incentive to beat City in the Cup Final (cos they need more apparently) and replace Brentford in the Fifth place trophy playoffs. Imagine the live feed to Brian Mbeumo’s living room (he’s got the whole team round to watch obviously) as Palace score two last minute goals to get a come from behind win against City. Gutted. You’ve also got Fulham in 11th with a chance of grabbing that final spot off Brentford in the next two weeks. It’s magic.",
      "And finally, we can do all this abroad to shut everyone up about the 39th game. It’s basically meaningless but also potentially transformative for a side that wins it so might just hit the sweet spot and be acceptable to English Fans.",
      "It’s amazing. I’m surprised no one’s thought of it already!",
      "I mean it’s definitely more interesting than what happens now though I suppose it provides another backdoor into the Champions League for underperforming clubs. It also adds games to an overcrowded football schedule. And it’s bad for the planet.",
      "I guess what I really want is for UEFA to limit Champions League entry to League winners, reinstate the Cup Winners Cup and let everyone else fight it out in the Europa League. But somehow my other idea seems more likely. It’s probably not an original idea but if it is I want 10% of the revenue generated by it.\nAshmundo (UPTFR)",
      "",
      "Goodbye Goodison…\nSad to see another of the great grounds depart. Between Highbury, WHL, Upton Park, The Dell and Maine Road…and Roker Park, the Baseball Ground…these stadia all had something so unique, and despite Spurs seemingly having done what many of the others failed, in retaining a sense of the old ground – just on steroids – the fans of all those teams I have spoken to, all miss the old ground, and would happily return to their old homes.",
      "The reasons for moving are all sound, but there will always be something hollow in the new stadium.",
      "Misty eyed nostalgia? Sure. I mean, I don’t miss being crammed into a toilet splashing around in piss, or the jostling queue for a warm plastic bottle of Carslberg, but the echoes of glory (and failure) can’t be recaptured.",
      "So, to Evertonians, good luck in the new gaff but I promise you, you’ll never feel about it the way you do Goodison Park.\nDan",

      "People do watch women’s football… \nI saw ATG’s mail this morning asking whether any men watch the women’s game, and I wanted to chime in—because I absolutely do. I follow the Chelsea Women just as closely as the men’s team, and what a season it has been under Sonia Bompastor. An unbeaten WSL campaign, multiple records shattered, and now a shot at completing a domestic treble in this weekend’s FA Cup Final.",
      "From what I’ve seen when attending matches, there’s a strong presence of male fans in the stands—but what really stands out is the number of families. The atmosphere is less hostile than the men’s games, making it a more welcoming and enjoyable experience for people of all ages. The ticket prices are also far more accessible, which certainly helps when bringing the whole family along.",
      "Personally, I’ve seen the women’s game grow dramatically in both audience and quality in recent years. If you haven’t yet, I really encourage all football fans to watch their women’s team, support them, and if possible, attend a match in person.\nThe Admin @ At The Bridge Pod"

Amorim came good on his promise of picking a strong Manchester United XI against Chelsea in a bid to avoid them being caught cold in Bilbao, while injury fears prompted Postecoglou to play the Tottenham backups vs Aston Villa.",
      "This perceived injustice led to great gnashing of teeth from Blues fans, who had seen their side romp to a 3-1 win over a hungover Liverpool less than two weeks ago, up against a midfield trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "It wasn’t a walk at Villa Park anyway. Son Heung-min looked like something closer to his old self on a happy hunting ground that’s seen him score more Premier League goals as a visitor than any other player (6), swinging a curled effort just over the bar, while Wilson Odobert’s flick after an excellent counter-attacking move was well saved by Emiliano Martinez in a first half which saw the home fans grow increasingly nervy and quiet.",
      "Villa were the dominant team. Antonin Kinsky was forced into a wonderful save to deny Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins was found in excellent positions on two or three occasions, while the outstanding Marco Asensio was frequently seen drifting past challenges in the No.10 position and saw one whipped effort drift agonisingly wide of the post.",
      "It was pretty clear after 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge that things weren’t going to plan. This Manchester United team had been in the ascendency to such a degree that Chelsea had lost all sense of themselves, leading Robert Sanchez to wave the players forward from a free-kick deep in the Blues half before booting it in the general direction of the helpless Tyrique George. There’s nothing Enzo Maresca hates more.",
      "When Harry Maguire volleyed in Bruno Fernandes’ cross, before they were handed a VAR reprieve for the most marginal of offsides, the Chelsea players resembled England vs Iceland at Euro 2016: anxious; confused; shellshocked. And they were playing the football to match.",
      "We lost count of the number of missed passes, while simply controlling the ball appeared to require extraordinary levels of concentration. Aside from an early fluff from Noni Madueke, which would probably have been ruled out for offside had he scored in any case, and a stunning effort from Reece James from outside the box which clipped the post, Chelsea offered very little against a side proven to wilt under the slightest pressure.",

The impact of George playing out of position as the No.9 paled in comparison to the suspended Nicolas Jackson, who’s a long way from perfect and an absolute fool for getting sent off against Newcastle, but is a handful for defenders even at his worst.",
      "Chelsea relied upon the only player to provide a moment of quality in the first half to come up trumps in the second. It was brilliant from James, who unsurprisingly impressed throughout at right-back because he’s a brilliant right-back and not a central midfielder, no matter how much Enzo Maresca tries to convince us he is.",
      "Space opened up for the captain on the edge of the box for a shot, but instead of taking it on with his left, he pirouetted onto his right and as everyone expected him to let fly he clipped the ball delightfully to the back post for Marc Cucurella, who extended his lead as Chelsea’s top scorer in 2025 with his fifth goal this year.",
      "Helped by an understandably meek Manchester United, whose focus had well and truly turned to Wednesday as Amorim rang the changes after going behind, Chelsea saw the game out comfortably, with some very welcome passion displayed by the players, manager and fans that was absent for 70 minutes here and all too often in a run that had seen them slip from the Champions League places.",

      "“The team didn’t have bad play, some decisions went against us. We lost it, in finals it happens. It was important we were there and again one year later we are there again.”",
      "On Crystal Palace, Guardiola continued: “They are a threat because they have quality. [Jean-Philippe] Mateta is strong and the quality in [Eberechi] Eze is obvious and of course the pace from [Ismaila] Sarr.",
      "“Sarr against Aston Villa in the semi-finals they punished them a lot, incredible pace. But not just him, Munoz, [Adam] Wharton is really good holding midfielder who links well inside. They are well structured defensively and their set pieces is one of the best in the Premier League. It’s a final. If we play against Palace or Aston Villa it would be the same. It’s a final, we cannot expect anything different.”"

      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing eight goals and two assists in 23 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "READ: ‘Arrogant’ Arsenal star, five Man Utd flops, only one Spurs man in ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of 2024/25",
      "But now reports in Spain claim that his continuation at Real Betis beyond this season has been ‘seriously complicated’ and the ‘main obstacle is qualifying for the Champions League’.",
      "It now looks almost certain that Real Betis will finish outside the top five in La Liga and that ‘directly affects the club’s financial aspirations, which would be unable to afford either a loan with advantageous terms or a permanent signing of the player.’",
      "Man Utd have told Antony that he is ‘not in their plans for next season’ with the Red Devils ‘looking for a way out for him, preferably through another loan, in the hope that he will maintain his form and increase his market value’.",
      "And now Villarreal, who look likely to pip Betis to fifth place and a Champions League spot, ‘enters the scene’ and the prospect of moving to El Submarino Amarillo ‘has enticed Antony’s entourage, who are keen to remain in Spain, but with a team with greater international exposure’.",
      "The Brazilian would ‘would fit perfectly into the manager’s plans’ at Villarreal with the Spanish club having the ‘upper hand’ over rivals Real Betis.",
      "It is understood that ‘what is clear’ is that Antony ‘will leave Manchester United again, and his destiny will be determined by the most ambitious project he faces.’",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "According to reports, one ‘beleaguered’ Manchester United star ‘faces’ being offloaded this summer, while three potential replacements have been mooted.",

      "These six could all move this summer – three are basically confirmed, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave City. We reckon Arsenal should take a look.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could scupper Tottenham Hotspur’s hopes of signing England international Angel Gomes on a free transfer.",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",

      "Manchester City and Chelsea somehow escape unscathed, while Liverpool – predictably – have no representatives in the ‘Big Eight’ Premier League Worst XI of the season; Manchester United have five.",
      "To keep things fair, this team only includes players who’ve made at least 20 appearances and 10 starts in the Premier League this season. Match ratings come via WhoScored, so don’t blame us — blame the algorithm.",
      "",
      "GK: Andre Onana (Manchester United) – 6.52\nEvery goalkeeper has a clanger in them – it comes with the territory when you’re playing in the most high-risk position on the pitch. But this is a particularly erratic bunch. Robert Sanchez, Guglielmo Vicario and Onana have all been walking VAR checks at times, while Emiliano Martinez, Ederson and Nick Pope aren’t exactly bastions of reliability either. Even David Raya and Alisson have had wobbles, though they’re clearly less error-prone than the rest.",
      "The algorithm has Onana rock bottom of the lot, and it’s hard to argue. Four errors leading to a shot and three leading directly to goals in the Premier League – plus a bizarre knack for making himself look smaller in his goal – make him a prime candidate to be replaced. If United had a bigger budget, Ruben Amorim would surely axe him.",
      "",
      "RB: Archie Gray (Spurs) – 6.17\nWe do feel for young Archie Gray. He’s filled in at right-back, centre-back and left-back in an injury-ravaged Spurs side, with the occasional reward of a cameo in midfield – his actual position.",
      "It’s been a turbulent season for Ange Postecoglou and his squad, and the algorithm has picked out Gray as the scapegoat, somehow making him the only Spurs player in the ‘Big Eight’ Worst XI of the season.",
      "Clocking up 1,563 Premier League minutes is no small feat, but playing here, there and everywhere, rarely in his natural role, probably isn’t doing wonders for his development.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.33\nAnother teenager enduring a bruising introduction to Premier League life. Leny Yoro’s debut season has been littered with injury setbacks, and limping off against West Ham on Sunday now puts his Europa League final place in doubt.",
      "That would be a fitting end to a stop-start campaign. United were warned about his fitness record before splashing £52million on him from Lille last summer. A metatarsal injury in just his second appearance ruled him out for months, and he didn’t make his Premier League debut until December 4.",
      "There’s clearly loads of potential – no-one’s disputing that – and it’s been a brutal year for just about everyone at Old Trafford. But this has been far from the ideal start for the 19-year-old in particular.",
      "",
      "CB: Pau Torres (Aston Villa) – 6.41\nA bit of experience at the back, but not quite the calming influence Aston Villa hoped for. Pau Torres looked a smart signing after arriving from Villarreal in July 2023, settling quickly into Unai Emery’s system. But things have unravelled somewhat in 2024/25.",
      "Villa’s January-February wobble – one win in seven with Torres injured – seemed to underline his importance. But since returning to fitness, he’s played in just four of their last eight games, all wins, and isn’t looking quite as undroppable as he once did.",
      "With calls for Tyrone Mings to get the nod over him, Torres suddenly feels more like a rotation option than a defensive cornerstone.",
      "",
      "LB: Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – 6.41\nJamie Carragher compared him to Wayne Rooney and Jude Bellingham, praising his “football arrogance” – and it’s been a pretty spectacular breakthrough season for Myles Lewis-Skelly. But two red cards have dragged down his average rating enough to sneak him into this back four.",

      "The lack of consistent starts has dragged down his average rating, and Willock ends up with the second-lowest score in this XI – only Gray has fared statistically worse.",

      "It’s been a miserable season all round, but United could still salvage something by beating Eriksen’s former club, Spurs, in next Wednesday’s Europa League final. He’s unlikely to start that one, which means he’ll probably get run-outs against Chelsea and Aston Villa in the final two league games – in a last-gasp attempt to bump his average rating and escape this team. Because obviously, that’s what he really cares about.",
      "",
      "RW: Leon Bailey (Aston Villa) – 6.42\nIn 23 Premier League appearances this season, Leon Bailey has managed a meagre one goal and two assists – and picked up more yellow cards (three) than either.",
      "Injuries continue to hamper the Jamaican, who took a step forward last term but hasn’t kicked on this time around. Villa have coped well without him, and with Marcus Rashford likely to leave, Donyell Malen looks set to leapfrog Bailey in Unai Emery’s pecking order – alongside Jacob Ramsey and Morgan Rogers.",

      "AM: Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United) – 6.32\nSigned from Bologna last summer to ease the burden on Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee looked an instant hit when he scored the winner on his debut against Fulham – but that was the high point for the Dutchman.",
      "The big question remains: where is his best position? It could be attacking midfield, up front, or maybe he’s destined for a Joelinton-style reinvention as a box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Rather than seeing this as a problem, Amorim might do well to view Zirkzee’s versatility as a genuine opportunity.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) – 6.43\nVilla might feel hard done by having three players in this worst XI, but hey, life isn’t fair, and the algorithm doesn’t lie.",
      "Ramsey’s red card against Bournemouth last weekend didn’t do his average rating any favours, helping land him a spot in this unfortunate XI after making the worst team of the weekend.",
      "With one goal and five assists from 28 Premier League games in 2024/25, it’s a disappointing return for a player with top talent. Still, at 23, he’s one of the brightest young talents in Emery’s squad.",
      "",
      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United) – 6.27\nIt’s hard to say anything about Hojlund that hasn’t already been said – the young Dane frustrates United fans every week, doing everything possible to make his £70m price tag feel like yet another colossal transfer disaster at Old Trafford.",
      "In 30 Premier League appearances this season, he’s managed a miserable four goals. Whatever excuses you want to make for United’s struggles or his age, that return is nowhere near good enough for a striker who cost so much.",

      "Only including available players and those with meaningful minutes this season, here is a Chelsea and Manchester United combined XI based on WhoScored match ratings in the 2024/25 Premier League.",
      "",
      "GK: Robert Sanchez (Chelsea) – 6.58\nDebates like Sanchez vs Andre Onana are exactly why we copped out with the WhoScored rating process. Both are error-prone but capable of world-class acrobatics. Unfortunately, the errors feel more frequent these days.",
      "What Onana does have over Sanchez is continuity: he’s United’s undisputed No.1, thanks in no small part to Altay Bayindir being extremely dodgy. Sanchez has rotated with Filip Jorgensen but has been Chelsea’s first choice for most of the league season. He should start on Friday, but a Europa Conference League final starting berth is up for grabs.",
      "",
      "RB: Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United) – 6.79\nA rare bit of solid recruitment from United, Mazraoui has been quietly reliable since arriving from Bayern Munich for a measly £15m. He’s featured at right-back, left-back and as a wide centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s three-man defence, as well as in attacking midfielder under Erik ten Hag.",
      "He looked more comfortable in a back four for Ten Hag but has still been one of Amorim’s most consistent players. He gets in ahead of Reece James, who’s mostly been used off the bench as Enzo Maresca carefully manages his fitness.",
      "",
      "CB: Tosin Adarabioyo (Chelsea) – 6.67\nAnnoyingly, Tosin’s rating is 0.02 better than Trevoh Chalobah’s, who has formed a solid and settled partnership with Levi Colwill in the latter half of the season. If this was opinion-based, Chalobah would be in.",
      "Still, Tosin – signed on a free from Fulham – has started 13 league games and been a regular in the cups, including 10 of Chelsea’s 12 Conference League fixtures. A shrewd bit of business.",
      "",
      "CB: Levi Colwill (Chelsea) – 6.70\nThe highest-rated options were actually Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez, but the former has only played two league games and the latter’s been out since February with an ACL injury.",
      "Colwill, meanwhile, has been a mainstay for Chelsea, starting 33 of their 36 league matches.",
      "",
      "LB: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United) – 6.84\nDalot has been hit-and-miss under Amorim but the algorithm hasn’t minded too much. He just edges out Marc Cucurella (6.63). Often shuffled around, he’s spent some time at left-back and just about gets the nod here.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Chelsea) – 7.02\nCaicedo has recently been filling in at right-back while Romeo Lavia partners Enzo Fernandez in midfield, but we’re picking players in their natural positions for this XI.",
      "The Ecuadorian has quietly been Chelsea’s most consistent performer this season, and the £105m price tag has stopped being a stick to beat him with — which is always a good sign. He also scored a belter at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture.",
      "",
      "CM: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – 7.20\nUnited’s best player by an absurd distance. Fernandes has been excellent despite the circus around him. Without him, United might have exited Europe months earlier and ended up scrapping with the bottom three.",
      "",
      "RW: Amad Diallo (Manchester United) – 7.17\nFully fit and finding form at the right time. A shame Ten Hag didn’t trust him — might still have a job if he had.",
      "Amorim has recognised Amad’s talent immediately, and the former Sunderland and Rangers loanee has flourished in the 3-4-3 as one of the two wide No.10s.",
      "",
      "AM: Cole Palmer (Chelsea) – 7.35\nThe chippy chips connoisseur ended a ludicrous 18-game goal drought recently, but still has 15 goals and eight assists in 35 league appearances, which tells you how ridiculous his first half of the season was.",
      "He bagged a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge last season and will hope to torment them again as Chelsea chase a top-five finish.",
      "",
      "LW: Pedro Neto (Chelsea) – 6.78\nPlenty of wide options, all underwhelming.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s ineligible and wouldn’t start anyway, Mykhaylo Mudryk is still suspended after that failed drugs test, and Alejandro Garnacho is wildly inconsistent. Neto might not be setting the world alight, but he’s probably the best of an unconvincing bunch.",
      "",
      "ST: Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea) – 6.41\nNicolas Jackson would’ve made this XI, but he decided to smash Sven Botman’s jaw and is suspended. So it’s Nkunku by default.",
      "He only has three Premier League goals but remains Chelsea’s second-top scorer across all competitions with 14. A summer move is likely — Liverpool are reportedly sniffing.",

      "What’s the point?\nIn the mailbox, Moses mentioned United don’t have parades for anything but Premier league and Champions league triumphs. What is the point of this self-imposed misery? The europa league is hardly a minor achievement if they do win, why not have a parade? Because you’re above that?",
      "If you can’t enjoy the journey to the top of football there really is no point. If the prem/champions league is the minimum why even have parades then? You should be winning trebles etc.. Treating football like a business where you can only celebrate hitting these benchmarks is just sad. Supporting a football club is not something you must do, why volunteer yourself for this and then treat victories like they’re actually not a good thing.",
      "Maybe I’d understand if it’s below expectations, like if City won the europa league, but United have now been utterly wank (by their lofty standards) for half of the current millenium. I hate United but still think their fans should enjoy a win, also hate Leeds but the parade they had for promotion looked great. I recently was at a Panachaiki (Patras) game where they managed to secure survival in the Greek second tier, hardly the zenith of football but all the locals who’ve watched their team continuously worsen over the past 20 years were having a great time (They’ve since been relegated for financial reasons but oh well). I’ve seen others point out they would be mocked for having a parade, who cares? Maybe this has only really risen with social media, but I cannot think of anything more insecure than not celebrating in case Ty from AFTV calls you a loser.",
      "Also agree totally with Lee (LFC) about Ratcliffe’s self made nonsense and what he forgot to include is when these massive corporations buyout struggling companies, they typically take out big loans, the debt from which is then saddled onto the struggling company they now own so said struggling company also has to pay off the loan used to buy them, as well as a variety of fees from their new owners (Which they avoid tax on!).

The utter joy in Sunderland was a sight to behold. Of course for Coventry fans — or Stockport for that matter, it’s agony, but the point I wanna make is that the playoffs are pure sporting drama — agony and ecstasy.",
      "There’s a lot of talk about how boring the PL season has been — with some truth, to be fair – and it made me wonder whether they’ve considered a playoff for the final CL spot (s)? so Top 4 get into the CL and then 5-8 play off? It would certainly liven things up. One of the joys of the playoffs is that a team can be way off it and still nip in to the final place.Stockport were 10 points better off than us (and it showed, quite often) and yet we’re the ones going to wembley.

      "Who’s going to admit culpability when a player inevitably gets injured in a “phase of play” that should never have been allowed to continue because an offside wasn’t given in time?",
      "And now, here we are with Taiwo Awoniyi (who I wish a speedy recovery, and I’m sure everyone else does as well).  I sit by a fellow season ticket holder in the Holte End who loses his shit every match when the assistant referee puts the flag up for offside about 2 minutes too late and I remind him every time that “it’s not his/her fault, they’re just doing what they’ve been told to do”.",
      "No amount of evidence or argument will convince me that this rule is a good one – it’s absolutely pointless and basically says VAR has the final say.  If that’s the case, we might as well do away with assistant referees altogether because the only other thing they have to do is flag for fouls or direct which way a throw in is given, with most of those decisions resulting in said assistant referee either not giving it at all or looking blankly at the actual referee waiting for them to give it! (Obviously not a serious suggestion.)",
      "The fix for this is really very, very simple.  If the player is blatantly offside by a considerable visual distance then let the assistant referee put their flag up as they will 99.99% be correct (if they’re not, demote them).  If the player is “close” to being offside to the point where it’s not visually easy to spot, THEN delay the raising of the flag so that VAR can check and confirm afterwards.  Yes, players may still get injured this way but it will be a hell of a lot less than the decisions where they are miles ahead of the last defender.  This makes perfect sense to me and I’d be interested to hear what other readers/commenters think?\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (And whilst we’re at it, keep VAR checks to 30 seconds otherwise the ref’s original call stands as it’s not “clear and obvious”.  You could even pipe the Countdown music out in the stadiums whilst the check is taking place.)",

      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""

      "Chelsea held their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification as Marc Cucurella’s second-half header secured a 1-0 win over Manchester United to send them fourth.",
      "The pressure was on for Chelsea after Aston Villa beat Tottenham, a result which would have moved them above Enzo Maresca's side had they dropped points but, after a tense wait for the breakthrough, captain Reece James set up Cucurella with a fine turn and cross.",
      "Although Ruben Amorim went with a strong line-up ahead of the Europa League final, if Chelsea had slipped up against this United side, 16th and now winless for a record eight Premier League games, questions would have been asked.",
      "Chelsea will at least be in the top five when they go to Nottingham Forest in their final game of the league season on May 25. Victory at the City Ground would guarantee a return to the Champions League after two years away.",
      "United have now lost 18 games in the league this season and are yet to hit 40 points, usually the target for teams to avoid relegation, with just one game left against Villa. Everything is riding on Wednesday's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Chelsea: Sanchez (7), James (8), Tosin (7), Colwill (8), Cucurella (8), Caicedo (8), Enzo (7), Palmer (7), Madueke (6), George (6), Neto (6).\n\n\nUsed subs:  Gusto (6), Lavia (6).\n\n\nMan Utd Onana (6), Lindelof (6), Maguire (6), Shaw (6), Mazraoui (6), Casemiro (5), Fernandes (7), Dorgu (5), Amad (6), Mount (6), Hojlund (5).\n\n\nUsed subs: Garnacho (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (6), Heaven (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Moises Caicedo.",
      "There was a party atmosphere after the full-time whistle blew for the final time at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea's owners are just one win away from their first Champions League qualification after more than £1bn spent and three coaches sacked.",
      "Behdad Eghbali, co-founder of Clearlake Capital, and co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley were on the pitch enjoying the moment with players and staff after the win was sealed. How different it might have been if there was another slip.",
      "Chelsea did not find it as easy as others had against United and, without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson, it was not clear where the breakthrough would come from as Tyrique George, 19, struggled up front in his first league start.",
      "Tension had built around the stadium - and only grew when Villa's victory over Spurs was confirmed - until the skipper came up with the moment of brilliance required to break the deadlock, having struck a post with an exquisite strike in the first half.",
      "Seventy minutes had passed when James pirouetted on the edge of the box and picked out Cucurella free in the box. His seventh goal of the season, a fine header back across goal, has a case for being his most important. Win at Forest and it is mission complete.",
      "Maresca will be as relieved as anyone. Chelsea were the better team for much of the game, but the wait made life uncomfortable. The consequences of falling short may have seen attentions turn to him. Instead, Eghabli's presence on the pitch was just a footnote.",
      "Keane said United had been a disgrace in the Premier League this season before kick-off at Chelsea. This was no disgrace. Not for the first time this season, Amorim's side upped it against a better side.",
      "This wasn't a performance akin to the win at Manchester City in December. But, with Amorim warning his players their starting spot in Bilbao was potentially at risk, there was a marked improvement from the defeat to West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire nearly got them off to the perfect start with a clever finish after 17 minutes but was denied by a marginal offside. The technology showed his shoulder was a whisker ahead of Tosin.",
      "There was little other to speak of aside from Amad forcing a save from Robert Sanchez shortly after Chelsea scored. Mason Mount fired wide in the first half, too, as his every touch was booed on his return to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United have set a low bar this season. Eighteen is the most defeats the club have suffered in the league since losing 20 games on their way to relegation in 1973/74.",
      "If not for the low quality of the promoted teams, Amorim would not have had the luxury of using this game as a means to play his side into form ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United have not waited this long for a league win since the season Sir Alex Ferguson won the FA Cup in 1990. That trophy is often looked back on as the one that saved him. There are parallels - with the form at least.",
      "Amorim doesn't appear to be in any danger just yet - even if he loses to Spurs in Bilbao. But success in the final, aside from the financial reward it brings, feels crucial for him to take something positive into next season.",
      "There is nothing which does so in the league. Since the start of April, United are the worst team in the top flight, drawing two and losing six of their eight games.",
      "Being in the latter stages of the Europa League has undoubtedly seen their league form suffer in that time. But that excuse only really carries if the gamble pays off. All eyes on Wednesday.",
      "\"I was quite confident. I know how difficult it is to play against Man Utd. We expected a tough game, congratulations to them because they played very well. It was a game where I had the good feeling to find a goal.",
      "\"Cucurella's got the same goal this season - against Wolves and Brentford. He's a good player, a very good player. It's about timing and being in the right position. It doesn't matter if you're tall, he's in the right position and right moment.\"",
      "Asked how big Champions League qualification would be, he added: \"For me, the problem is in general people, you the press, think Chelsea is the same Chelsea from years ago. It's not the same. I can understand people struggle to understand it.",
      "\"Once again, tonight Jackson was suspended, we played with Tyrique, six players from the academy. Years ago, if Didier Drogba was injured, Diego Costa would play or Fernando Torres. This is a completely different Chelsea. We are in the right direction, but we can bring the club to where it deserves to be.",
      "\"I don't think - since I'm here - that we are spending more money than others clubs. We are spending the same money. But we are building something important, people have to trust us. We are in the right direction, we are working well and we can fight, in the future, for important titles.\"",
      "\"It was the good things we talked about before the game: we had some moments, improving the way we played football, we pressed quite well and had some chances.",
      "\"We were quite aggressive, we need to be more aggressive. We have good build-up to the last third but then we miss something. But we faced the competition in the right way today, we were competitive.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer. The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and can push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "\"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving.",
      "\"We've been working the whole season, the message has been clear from the start. Executing it has been hard. Today, what we're trying to do pays off.",
      "\"I feel confident, it's the most I've played in a few seasons. I want to help the team and hope we can finish it in the right way.",
      "\"The Champions League is where the club belongs, competing in the best competitions. People like to write us off and call us young ,but it's an experienced Manchester United team and we did what we needed to do to get the three points.\""

      "An \"embarrassed\" Ruben Amorim has claimed there is \"something wrong\" with the way his Manchester United side play football ahead of their meeting with Chelsea, live on Friday Night Football.",
      "United suffered their 13th league defeat since Amorim was appointed in November against West Ham on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford, to keep them just two places above the relegation zone. .",
      "They have now gone seven games without a win in the Premier League, matching their longest winless streak in the competition, and will now be tasked with addressing the poor run of form against Enzo Maresca's Champions League-chasing side away from home.",
      "At the time of Amorim taking over in November, United sat in 14th place but their struggles in front of goal and woeful defensive record, leading to just six wins in the league, have now seen them drop to 16th on 39 points.",
      "Regardless of how they perform in the final fixtures, United are guaranteed to finish with their worst Premier League season on record - and by some margin.",
      "\"Sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically, it is the way we face competition and suffer. When we get mad about losing.",
      "\"Everything we have been through, I have a clear picture and a clear feeling of what this team needs to be so much better.",
      "\"It is not just on the pitch, it is outside the pitch. We have all the conditions to be better.\"",
      "The 40-year-old is now approaching his second transfer window in charge of the club and will likely be backed after only seeing defensive duo Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven arrive in the winter, but he has insisted the problems plaguing his team cannot all be addressed by fresh investment.",
      "Amorim said: \"There are some things we cannot change in summer, the feeling in the club and the way we see it.",
      "\"The feeling that we cannot lose a match. We have to change that and not think about transfers. That is more profound than changing people. We are doing that but people cannot see that.",
      "\"The way we work and the behaviour we have in the club. The things we cannot see, we are working on it. We need to forget about the final and need to be better against Chelsea.\"",
      "The defeat to the Hammers, who ended their own winless run of eight games in the process, marked the 14th league game and 10th under Amorim where United have failed to score.",
      "United's poor record in front of goal, with only Leicester, Southampton and Everton blanking more, points to a team short of confidence. But Amorim insists it is more \"profound\" than that.",
      "When asked if confidence within the squad was one of the root causes for their struggles, Amorim continued: \"That is one thing.",
      "\"To fight till the end and the way we face competition [is another], it is not okay to lose or draw. That feeling is not about confidence, it is about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable. That is not a lack of confidence, it is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "Somehow, there is still light at the end of the tunnel for this squad. The Europa League final against fellow strugglers Tottenham in Bilbao on May 21 offers a chance for United to secure both silverware and Champions League football.",
      "However, despite it being the obvious priority, Amorim is determined not to let any focus shift away from the trip to Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I am not worried about momentum for the final, it is a different game. Tottenham is living more or less the same way.\" Instead, he is looking at Friday's fixture as an opportunity for his side to show the fight and desire he has been so desperate to see since leaving Lisbon.",
      "\"It is the way we face competition. We are Manchester United,\" he said, building on his explanation on what was missing from the squad.",
      "\"We are just okay about not performing and it is not about momentum, it is so much more profound than that.",
      "\"When I listen to people criticising the way we perform, I cannot say anything because it is so clear that people are right.",

      "Marcus Rashford has played his last game for Aston Villa - for now, at least - after Unai Emery confirmed injury would keep him out against Tottenham. The forward is ineligible to face Manchester United on the final day, so attention now turns to his future.",
      "Rashford is set to decide on his next steps after the season is over, with little certainty around where he will be playing once the summer transfer window has closed, aside from the expectation that it will be away from United, who have set their asking price at £40m.",
      "Being at Villa and working under Emery has rejuvenated Rashford, whose relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim broke down before he left in February. The forward, often overlooked for a place in United's struggling squad, displaced Ollie Watkins at Villa.",
      "Rashford, scorer of four goals and provider of six assists in 17 games on loan, began to repair his reputation at Villa after a concerning 18 months at Old Trafford in which his work-rate and desire were widely questioned.",
      "Those performances will not have gone unnoticed and are likely to generate a bigger market for Rashford this summer than the one in January. His next move will be crucial, particularly ahead of the 2026 World Cup. But where does he want to go?",
      "Villa are outside the top five on goal difference with two games left to play and, unless they can win heavily against struggling Tottenham and Man Utd, are relying on the teams above them to drop points to return to Europe's top competition.",

      "United have set that same asking price for any other interested suitors, and it is understood Villa will not have first refusal on Rashford.",
      "Emery's side can make the deal permanent for £40m this summer if they wish, but there is nothing in the agreement which gives them priority.",
      "This means that other interested clubs could buy him at United's valuation if the club and player agree to their proposal.",
      "If Rashford goes elsewhere in the Premier League, it is believed he does not want to move to London and feature for one of the clubs in the capital.",
      "Barcelona were keen on Rashford in the winter window and continue to monitor his situation. The forward was said to be interested in a move to the Catalonian club but an approach never materialised.",

      "Rashford's wages, of which Villa agreed to cover at least 75 per cent of during his loan, were considered a potential stumbling block in January and could well cause issues again.",
      "United have Rashford on a contract until 2028 that has him among the top earners at Old Trafford. Finding a club that is willing to match his salary may not be an easy task.",
      "Given United's financial constraints, raising transfer funds from player sales will be a focus this summer, and Rashford is one of the top candidates for that thanks to his form at Villa.",
      "His representatives are against including their client in any part-exchange deals, however, which means United need to find a cash buyer if they are to part ways for good.",
      "In the eventuality no permanent deal can be agreed, then United may be forced to loan Rashford out again because he still has three years left on his contract.",
      "Both United and Rashford are understood to believe the fresh environment has worked wonders for him and the intention is to continue that on a permanent basis.",
      "Emery's side sit in sixth place, one spot outside securing a spot among Europe's elite, after winning six of their last seven games in the Premier League.",
