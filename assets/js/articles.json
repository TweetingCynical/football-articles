      "Thierry Henry battled Paul Scholes and Steven Gerrard during his career at Arsenal, but it is the Manchester United legend who he believes takes the crown as the greatest midfielder",
      "Thierry Henry has long been a huge fan of Paul Scholes and even picked the Manchester United legend over Steven Gerrard.",
      "Gerrard and Scholes were two of the Premier League's best midfielders during the 2000s. They both had highly successful careers, with Scholes winning 11 Premier League titles and Gerrard inspiring Liverpool to lift the 2005 Champions League.",
      "Henry played against both of the star midfielders during his time at Arsenal, with Scholes' United side being the Gunners' biggest rivals in that period. While Liverpool were also challenging at the top of the Premier League at the time, Henry has put Scholes ahead of Gerrard.",
      "Back in 2020, Henry was asked who the Premier League's best midfielder had been during his time as a player. And he revealed that Scholes pipped the Liverpool icon in his rankings.",
      "\"Paul Scholes,\" said Henry said when asked who the best midfielder was. \"The next one would have been, right behind, very close, Stevie G. But I have to go with Paul Scholes. He was just ahead in his head.",
      "\"He made Manchester United tick. Every time we were playing them we needed to find a way to stop him. It's true. I think Stevie G comes really close to him. But Paul Scholes would have to win. You guys in England had, on paper, the best midfield in the world.\"",
      "It is not only Gerrard who Henry has put Scholes ahead of, even insisting the former midfielder was a better player than him. Henry is widely regarded as one of the Premier League's greatest-ever players.",
      "But rather than naming himself as the division's best-ever star, it is Scholes who the Frenchman gave that honour. He insisted that the Englishman had not received the credit he deserves.",
      "\"I would have to go Paul Scholes. I don’t think people have given him the credit he deserves. One of the best, if not the best, I’ve played against, he could do anything,\" Henry told Sky News in 2015.",
      "\"Unfortunately for him, when he was playing for the national team, for England, sometimes people didn’t see it like that. If I had a Paul Scholes in my team, everything would be around him.",
      "\"At Manchester United, they saw it like that, but I think Paul Scholes is one of the best I’ve played against in this league, and seen anywhere.\"",
      "Scholes spent his entire career with United, making more than 700 appearances for the Red Devils. As well as 11 Premier Leagues, he also won three FA Cups, two League Cups and two Champions Leagues.",

      "After seeing Mo Salah score his 20th goal of the season against Sparta Prague, Klopp has warned the Egyptian is now back to his best form. Speaking after the win, the German coach said: \"The timing is super good. You saw that last night, how many goals did he set up first half? Then he was involved in everything else pretty much.",
      "“He was exceptional. It was a strange game in the second half, I would have loved to have taken him off, but that was not possible because of Bobby Clark’s injury situation, and he managed that pretty well.”",
      "Salah’s goal against the Czech side saw him break a long-standing Liverpool record. He is the first man to score 20 goals in seven consecutive seasons. The previous record was six, which belonged to iconic former forward Ian Rush.",

      "\"Actually the thing is we wanted to change and the fourth official was showing it but the ref let the game go on and then we get the yellow card (for Quansah),\" he said. \"The yellow card wasn't the problem, I was afraid Conor Bradley could get injured in that situation and that's what clicked a little bit in my mind.\"",
      "Klopp added: \"I told the ref after the game the yellow card was fine. I was calm before and calm after, just in that little moment I lost it a little bit. Sorry.\"",
      "Former Newcastle star Lee Clark has revealed that it is his “ultimate dream” to see his son Bobby play for the Magpies in the future. Speaking on the Tippy Tappy Football podcast, he said: “Absolutely. I don’t know how many fathers and sons have done it for the club.",
      "“I was lucky enough to do it 265 times. Who knows, he might have to do an Alan Shearer and come back. But yeah, that would be my ultimate dream. Definitely.”",
      "Clark senior represented Newcastle during two spells. Bobby also spent seven years within the club’s youth system before a move to Liverpool.",

      "Liverpool flop El Hadji Diouf has accused former Cameroon boss Rigobert Song of disrespecting Andre Onana.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has endured a difficult season for both his club and country. Onana made a number of high-profile errors after arriving at Old Trafford from Italian giants Inter Milan. That led to calls that he should be dropped for the Red Devils and Cameroon for the African Cup of Nations earlier this year, particularly after Onana linked up with his international teammates late.",
      "He eventually made just one appearance at the tournament, a decision that former Liverpool forward Diouf believes was a mistake. Speaking to Canal+, he said: “André Onana is someone I respect a lot and I congratulate him for what he does and his commitment to his team.",
      "“How can you have a goalkeeper of Onana’s calibre, an immense talent who plays for Manchester United and not play him in the round of 16 game? For me, it’s a lack of respect and if I were a player, I wouldn’t agree with that.”",
      "It's quite the contrast for Diouf, who during the tournament had queried the decision from Cameroon to allow Onana to link up late with the squad.",
      "Then he said, according to Foot Mercato: “Cameroon have gone backwards. These days, I’m in pain for the Cameroon fans and Cameroon people.",
      "\"They say they are the continent, but it’s more the continental hotel, because they are sitting back on their history. To see their goalkeeper arriving two days before a game. That would be unacceptable for Senegal.”",
      "Onana has since opened up on the troubles he stumbled into during his first few months at Man United. At one point, he was on the receiving end of some scathing criticism from a youth player at the club's Carrington training ground, being asked \"are you going to save one or what?\" following a string of unsaved shots in training. That brutal comment came after a difficult showing in the Red Devils’ 3-3 draw with Galatasaray in the Champions League.",
      "He explained that his early issues were simply a case of adaptation.",
      "“It was a difficult time for me,” said Onana. “Now I'm feeling a bit better. I already know the goalkeeper that I am, but it took me six months or seven months not to play good, just to feel good. When I moved from Amsterdam to Milan, that adaptation was quite easy. But it took me seven, eight months here. It was just time to learn and go game by game.",
      "“Everything was new, it was difficult for me to feel at home, for so many reasons, in a new country. It was just moments. Sometimes you're faced with a difficult situation, just not feeling good, not playing good, because I didn’t think I started to play good. So, it was just something strange, but it was a good time for me to learn. Because I learned a lot at that time.",
      "“Playing in the final of the Champions League for Inter and being knocked out in the first stage a few months later, was a big lesson for me. Now I think I have everything on my back, learn from it, move on and try to be happy. That is the most important thing.”",

      "James is a part owner of Liverpool through his investment in owners Fenway Sports Group and Van Dijk modelled at the launch of his new fashion line ‘LFC x LeBron’ earlier this month. Liverpool posted a video of Van Dijk watching a message from James where ‘King James’ predicts he will do “amazing things” for the Reds and urged him to “strive for greatness”.",

      "“We’re in a good place to do that this season - again. Every season is always a challenge, but this season we’re in a special situation.” Van Dijk says he is learning from James - and the other top athletes in the world - on how to handle the negatives and positives.",
      "“I look at all the top athletes because I feel they all have a big role, either as a role model or for their team and community, and there are so many things you can learn,” he said.",
      "“There’s LeBron, Djokovic, Roger Federer, Tom Brady - I could name so many. I like to listen to these guys and learn how they dealt with being at the top and dealing with difficult moments, but also good moments.” Van Dijk has already copied one aspect of James’ lifestyle and he has his own physio and chef to help him recover and recharge after games.",
      "“Those two parts are very important,” he said. “I do my recovery stuff so I can be optimally prepared for the next challenge, especially when you’re having three games a week. It was already fine, but I want to be better and make the most out of it, and that hard work nobody sees is the key to success.”",
      "Van Dijk is back to his imperious best after last season’s difficult campaign for Liverpool and says everything has “just clicked” again. “I feel very comfortable in every aspect of the game,” he said. “Obviously confidence is a big driver, but I think I’ve made big steps in possession.",
      "“The manager said the other day it’s not just as simple as wearing the armband and I think a lot of things just clicked again.” That confidence is reflected in his view of Sunday's testing trip to Old Trafford.",
      "“It’s always difficult, it’s always intense,” he said. \"It’s the history of the games with the two biggest clubs in England and that brings extra expectation and pressure. But why not just go out there and enjoy it, play our game and hopefully go to the next round?”",

      "Paris Saint-Germain have reignited their interest in Marcus Rashford amid his struggles at Manchester United, but Erik ten Hag has cast serious doubt over Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co cashing in",
      "Erik ten Hag strongly doubts that Manchester United would be willing to cash in on Marcus Rashford, who Paris Saint-Germain are preparing to make a £75million bid for.",
      "Rashford, 26, has endured a difficult season like many of his United teammates and there've been frequent suggestions that all isn't well behind the scenes, as new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe prepares to overhaul the squad. In January, an unsanctioned night out in Belfast led to the England international missing training and he was dropped from the squad for one match.",
      "Despite his poor form after recording a career-best 30 goals last season, PSG are circling and harbour a long-standing interest. Ten Hag wants to keep him, though, having handed Rashford a new bumper five-year contract worth £250,000 per week last summer.",
      "\"We did not re-sign him last season for four [more] years with the intention to sell him now,\" the United manager affirmed ahead of Sunday's grudge FA Cup quarter-final clash with Liverpool. \"He should be part of this project.\"",
      "Mirror Football reported this week that PSG made a concerted effort to sign Rashford in 2022 following another disappointing season at Old Trafford. The French champions were prepared to hand the forward a deal worth a whopping £400,000-a-week and have now reignited their interest.",
      "With star man Kylian Mbappe all but certain to be joining Real Madrid this summer, the Parisians want Rashford to replace him. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi confirmed PSG's interest in late 2022 when the 26-year-old hadn't yet signed his new contract with United and was on course to become a free agent.",
      "Al-Khelaifi told Sky Sports: \"He's another player that is really amazing. And for free? To have Rashford for free, every club would run after him, definitely. We're not hiding it, we spoke before and… interest. But the moment was not a good moment for both sides.\"",
      "Your turn! Should Manchester United sell Marcus Rashford? Join the debate in the comments section.",
      "Rashford recently reaffirmed his commitment to United amid criticism that he isn't putting enough effort into his goal-shy performances under Ten Hag. \"When I make a mistake, I'll be the first one to put my hand up and say that I need to do better. But if you ever question my commitment to Man United, that's when I have to speak up,\" he wrote for The Players' Tribune.",
      "\"I grew up here. I have played for this club since I was a boy. My family turned down life-changing money when I was a kid so I could wear this badge. If you start questioning my commitment to this club and my love for football then I'd simply ask you to have a bit more humanity.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen has been told he \"is no longer there\" by fellow Dane Thomas Gravesen after he was selected for the recent Denmark squad",
      "Former Real Madrid star Thomas Gravesen has blasted Christian Eriksen's inclusion in the latest Denmark squad amid the midfielder's struggle for game time at Manchester United.",
      "The former Tottenham star has barely featured for the Red Devils this term and when he has, Eriksen has underwhelmed. His 11 starts this campaign has brought about just one goal, with only two of his outings coming this calendar year - the last of which was last month's shock 2-1 home defeat by Fulham.",
      "Kasper Hjulmand’s Denmark are gearing up for friendly fixtures against both Switzerland and the Faroe Islands, but former Real Madrid man Gravesen has torn into the decision to call Eriksen up. Speaking to Tipsbladet, the ex-Everton hardman did not hold back in his assessment of the squad selection.",
      "\"It is completely scandalous that he has not selected Nicolai Vallys. It’s a scandal of great proportions that we have a national coach who looks so little towards Denmark when there’s a player running around with those qualities,\" Gravesen claimed.",
      "\"When you look at the way he is playing football at the moment. And then they choose to take out a player who has sat on the bench at Manchester United, Christian Eriksen, just to maintain relations.\"",
      "Gravesen continued by tearing into Eriksen's demise on the pitch, adding: \"The Christian Eriksen we all know, he is no longer there. Christian Eriksen doesn’t play football anymore.",
      "\"Christian Eriksen sits on the bench and watches football. Christian Eriksen as we know him, he is no more. You must not fall back on the fact that you are only selected on merit. One must not single out Christian Eriksen only on his merits.\"",
      "Denmark boss Hjulmand has also addressed Eriksen's poor season but instead seemed to shift the blame on United rather than the player. He explained: \"It's not the best situation as it is right now. I really, really hope that changes. I'm pretty sure we'll see a fit Christian. I know he is.",
      "\"But of course, if it continues, it can become like it is with everyone else for Christian. There can be a concern about the level one can perform at if they don't get more playing time than what it is currently.",
      "\"I really hope it changes. A player as talented as Christian needs to play, and we certainly hope it changes at United. But it's not the best situation not to have played more.\"",
      "Eriksen's United contract expires next summer and it seems increasingly unlikely that the Red Devils will look to renew. Speculation has even suggested that the club could look to buy the Dane out of the rest of his deal to free up wages for a replacement as soon as the next transfer window.",

      "David Moyes guided his side through to the quarter-finals of Europe's secondary competition with an outstanding 5-0 win over Freiburg as the Hammers wiped out their one-goal deficit from the first leg. Lucas Paqueta, Jarrod Bowen and Aaron Cresswell ensured a positive result was on the cards at the London Stadium before a brace from Mohammed Kudus.",
      "That victory improves England's standings in the UEFA co-efficient rankings, with the Premier League on track to secure a fifth place in Europe's elite club competition next season. Those rankings will decide which nation receives an additional qualification for the Champions League's new format next term.",
      "The 2024/25 season will see the Champions League move to 36 teams competing in a Swiss format where clubs will play eight matches against eight different opponents. The top eight performing sides will then progress to the knockout rounds, with teams ranked from ninth to 24th competing in play-offs to make the quarter-final.",
      "The expansion sees an extra place awarded to the two best performing leagues in Europe this term. With Arsenal, Man City, Liverpool, West Ham and Aston Villa all still in contention across Europe's various competitions, the Premier League now appears to be in the driving seat to earn a fifth Champions League spot bar a series of poor quarter-final results.",

      "Italy, Spain and Germany are the counties competing with England to earn an additional qualification spot. Before this week, Italy and Germany led the rankings but both now have fewer teams remaining in European competition than England.",
      "The news could also come as a boost to mid-table sides Chelsea and Newcastle as the extra place could see teams as low as eighth earn a place in Europe next term. The Blues are four points behind Brighton who currently hold the position and have a game in hand, despite currently sitting in 11th position in the Premier League.",

      "Mainoo has burst onto the scene this year and the teenage sensation is now a mainstay in the Manchester United first-team picture. The United midfield has produced some stellar displays and scored a match winner at Wolves as he becomes the latest academy graduate to make an impact at Old Trafford.",
      "His performances have seen him compared to Seedorf - one of the greatest midfielders of his generation. The Dutchman claimed 87 caps for his country and, during a well-travelled trophy-laden career, won the Champions League with three times teams.",
      "Despite Mainoo's classy start to life in the United starting XI, Ten Hag is keen to have the 18-year-old build his own identity whilst taking the best and being influenced by players who've come before him.",
      "He said: \"So I think never ever compare players with another player. Never. Because Kobbie Mainoo, but also other players, they build their own identity. Don’t compare with anyone. His skillset, that is so typical. And it’s so Kobbie Mainoo, it’s nothing to do with other players.",
      "\"Of course, he can learn from other players, especially from great players as Clarence Seedorf was. But Kobbie Mainoo is Kobbie Mainoo. He has big potential and I’m quite sure he will have a big career.\"",
      "Despite Mainoo's stellar season, which began with a breakout performance in a win at Everton back in November, the United star has been overlooked by England boss Gareth Southgate. During his time in charge of the Three Lions he's been more than willing to give youth a chance.",
      "The likes of Jarrad Branthwaite have been included in the latest squad to take on Brazil and Belgium this month. Southgate is well aware of the quality shown by Mainoo, as well as other young Englishman, but claims his lack of appearances were a factor in him being overlooked.",
      "The England boss said: \"There are some players with the Under-21s, especially in midfield, who are doing exceptionally well. The likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Harvey Elliott, Rico [Lewis] was with us last time, Archie Gray at Leeds is doing very, very well.\"",
      "He also added: \"I think that he’s doing brilliantly for a young player, and we’re never slow to put a young payer into the seniors, but he’s only had a handful of games and you have to be very careful development-wise in making those decisions at the right time. We think ideally we should allow him that space to develop at his own speed.\"",

      "The Ineos chief has just come on board and already made some shrewd off the pitch captures ahead of the summer, when he'll really get his first chance to make an impact on the Red Devils. Unfortunately for him though, he could see a major dent in the club's accounts.",
      "Recruitment will be a major part of his remit but the billionaire will have to honour fees that were already dictated by previous decisions. Mason Mount, for example, was signed last summer with potential add-ons, and he isn't the only player in the squad with those terms.",
      "As a result Ratcliffe could well see his transfer budget eaten into as United pay out on guarantees they made. The £158m is a hike of almost £55m from the previous season.",
      "The Times has reported a line in United's accounts, which read: “Under the terms of certain contracts with other football clubs and agents in respect of player transfers, additional amounts, in excess of the amounts included in the cost of registrations, would be payable by the Group if certain substantive performance conditions are met . . . The maximum additional amounts that could be payable is £158,040,000.”",
      "As well as players, off the pitch members of staff have received handy pay-offs. Richard Arnold has recently stood down as the club's chief executive and was given a pay off of £5.5m once he formally resigned his position on February 15. That is in addition to his salary of £2.56m - which already made him one of the highest paid people in his role in the Premier League.",
      "United last summer were already operating with serious financial parameters as Erik ten Hag fought to remain within the guidelines that every club must abide by. That ultimately influenced his recruitment, as it had done the previous year.",
      "The Dutchman, whose own future beyond this season is unclear, had to drive down the price of players like Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund to ensure he could fill gaps in his squad whilst sticking to the budget he was given.",
      "In his first year, after spending big in the summer on the likes of Antony and Casemiro, Ten Hag had to utilise the loan market in January due to having a lack of funds available. He signed the likes of Wout Weghorst as United sought a temporary replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo.",

The Three Lions boss is hoping Shaw will be fully fit for Euro 2024, which gets underway in mid-June.",
      "Southgate said in a press conference: \"We are all hoping - ourselves and Manchester United - that he could be back just before the end of the league season. But that is getting really tight to the Euros, and there is a reality about whether it’s possible to play seven games in the Euros.",

      "Scrum-half was man of the match in his side's epic game against World Club champions - only to come unstuck in dramatic ending as Red Devils fall 22-12",
      "Gutted Salford boss Paul Rowley refused to put the boot in on Marc Sneyd’s after the scrum-half’s late shocker.",
      "The Red Devils ace, 33, turned from hero to villain as Wigan broke their hearts. He looked set to deliver his side a famous win - and put them top of the table. But after inspiring a brilliant comeback from 10-0 down to lead 12-10, Sneyd’s ill-advised short drop-out went badly wrong in the 75th minute.",
      "It only went as far as England centre Jake Wardle who went in untouched to protect leaders Wigan’s 100 percent winning start. To make matters worse, the World Club champions were down to 12 men at the time after England scrum-half Harry Smith was sin-binned for checking Ryan Brierley. But asked what he said to man-of-the-match Sneyd, Rowley said: “My words were ‘it happens.’",
      "“He won’t get any kicks from me. For 79 minutes he was brilliant. We’ve no dramas [with Sneyd]. He’s a great player. He’s just made one miscalculation. And he already wants to get back out there. We’re obviously disappointed.",
      "\"We don’t just want to challenge Wigan, we want to beat them. But we were masters of our own downfall. The game was there for us to win but we had a crazy 10 minutes.”",
      "To rub salt into the wounds, Bevan French scored another try for leaders Wigan with the final play, Adam Keighran slotting his second goal. Salford won at St Helens for the first time in 44 years six days earlier and looked set for a fourth straight win here. Wigan took a 10-0 lead after Smith converted Abbas Miski’s 46th minute try.",
      "But Sneyd’s perfect kicking set up tries for Sam Stone and Tim Lafai which he converted both times. However, Wigan gang-tackled Salford debutant David Nofoaluma to force him 10 yards back for that crucial drop-out. The depleted hosts were down to their last 17 fit and available players for this match but only trailed 4-0 at the break after Liam Marshall’s 39th minute try.",
      "They gave debuts to Ethan Ryan and new signing Gil Dudson but relieved Wigan boss Matt Peet admitted: “When Harry got binned I must admit I thought the game might get away from us. But those extra efforts, in the end they paid off. It was a big effort to force their guy back over the line for that drop-out.",
      "“I’m proud of it. It’s something we really celebrate. It’s an important trait: character over skill. But you have to admire how Salford play.”"

      "Gary Taylor-Fletcher has slammed Nemanja Vidic and admitted he doesn't think the ex-Manchester United defender was anywhere near the level of Virgil van Dijk, Rio Ferdinand and John Terry.",
      "Vidic spent eight successful years at United between 2006 and 2014 after joining from Spartak Moscow, making 300 appearances and winning 10 major trophies. The Serbian is generally renowned as one of the greatest centre-backs in Premier League history.",
      "However, Taylor-Fletcher, who came up against Vidic twice during Blackpool's top-flight campaign in 2010/11, hit out at Vidic and doesn't think he deserves the praise he receives.",
      "In reply to a tweet which hailed Vidic and his achievements, Taylor-Fletcher said: \"Yeah and I tore him apart twice for Blackpool in 2010/11 season. He was no where near levels of Ferdinand, Terry & VVD. He was the same level as [Martin] Skrtel. Solid good player. Not elite.\"",
      "Taylor-Fletcher retired from football in June 2019 following a spell at Welsh side Llandudno. The 42-year-old previously played for the likes of Blackpool, Leicester, Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield and Lincoln, scoring a respectable 136 goals in 637 appearances during his 20-year career.",
      "He spent six years at the Tangerines and notably struck against United on the final day of the 2010/11 season. Taylor-Fletcher lined up against Vidic at Old Trafford - and in the reverse fixture - as he put Blackpool 2-1 up, before they eventually fell to a 4-2 defeat and relegation back to the Championship.",

One said: \"Thank you for speaking nothing but facts.\" Another agreed: \"I'll buy you a drink whenever you're down next.\" A third admitted: \"This is true. He did. At Old Trafford as well.\" A fourth said: \"He's not lying.\"",

      "As reported by The Times, it is understood he received an eye-watering pay-off. According to the club’s interim financial report, Arnold was handed around £5,529,000.",

      "Manchester United's teenage sensation Kobbie Mainoo has not been called up to the England squad for the upcoming friendlies despite impressing manager Gareth Southgate",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been a shining light in an otherwise miserable season for Manchester United this term, but hasn't done enough in the eyes of England boss Gareth Southgate.",
      "The 18-year-old made his full Premier League debut for the club back in November and hasn't looked back since. Since then, he's made 22 appearances across all competitions and shown that despite his age, he is more than comfortable operating in the middle of the park for a club as big as United.",
      "Therefore, many fans and pundits alike were hoping to see Mainoo's name on the Three Lions squad-list for the upcoming friendlies against Brazil and Belgium. However, the teenager hasn't made the cut and is instead expected to feature for the Under-21s.",
      "However, ex-England international and Liverpool legend John Barnes has explained that Mainoo's omission may not be a bad thing, given United's poor form means the Red Devils academy graduate will only be subject to more scrutiny at international level",
      "Barnes told bonuscodebets : \"Should Mainoo be playing for England? Why don’t we give him time to develop? He’s playing in a team that’s not even in the top five or four.",
      "\"United aren’t playing particularly well so why are we going to put pressure on him. If he was playing that well, wouldn’t United be in the top four or five and they’re not.”",
      "\"So I’m not going to get carried away because he’s playing well and having a good breakthrough season. And he is playing very well but as with all young players, let them develop slowly and he’ll get his rewards later on.\"",
      "Southgate actually shed light on his reasons for overlooking Mainoo on this occasion and his sentiment was similar to the one shared by Barnes. The England boss highlighted the fact that the talented teen simply hasn't played enough games.",
      "\"I think that he's doing brilliantly for a young player and we're never slow to put a young player into seniors,\" Southgate claimed. \"But he's only had a handful of games and you have to be very careful development-wise in making those decisions at the right time.",
      "\"So we think ideally, we should allow him that space to develop at his own speed. He's not at the point in terms of number of games that Jude (Bellingham) and Bukayo (Saka) were when they came in for the first time.",
      "\"But I repeat: he's doing really well for a young player. He's a good footballer - you can see that. And he's getting some fabulous experience with Manchester United at the moment. And he looks a really good character.\"",

      "Ignoring the claims of young midfield stars - including Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo - could cost England manager dear as he again keeps faith with stalwart Jordan Henderson",
      "According to the official announcement from the Football Association, the 25-man England squad contains only five midfielders - Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Jordan Henderson, James Maddison and Declan Rice.",
      "Amongst the nine players listed in the forwards section, many of them do jobs in midfield so we should not take the categorisation too seriously. But surely there was midfield room for one of the most exciting prospects to emerge in that department this season?",
      "He has tried to explain but it remains hard to fathom why Southgate has decided not to take the chance to have a good close-up look at Kobbie Mainoo. Yes, he is relatively young and inexperienced but his club team-mate Marcus Rashford made his England debut at the age of 18 and Mainoo turns 19 next month.",
      "And in his 22 appearances for United - and there would have been more had he not suffered an injury in pre-season - one of the many qualities that have stood out is his maturity. It is clear Mainoo has a great temperament.",
      "While on the subject of midfielders, a resurgent Ross Barkley can also count himself unlucky not to be in this squad and the same can be said of Harvey Elliott, who was, arguably, the best player on the park in that titanic tussle between Liverpool and Manchester United on Sunday. But under Southgate’s and the FA’s demarcation lines, they might be considered attackers.",
      "What Mainoo would have given to Southgate is an alternative to Henderson and, boy, the England manager needs one. To the vast majority of England fans, what midfield three looks better?",
      "Rice, Henderson and Bellingham? Or Rice, Mainoo and Bellingham? Playing behind a front three of Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane and Phil Foden, the latter looks tasty. In his three tournament campaigns, Southgate’s approach has been underpinned by an insistence on giving his defence as much protection as possible.",
      "Rice and Kalvin Phillips, Rice and Henderson. That approach has taken England to a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final and a Euros final.",
      "But the players always repeat the mantra of taking the next step, taking the final step, winning trophies, and that is why Southgate should be duty-bound to keep searching for difference-makers. Mainoo, even at his young age, could be a difference-maker.",
      "He can offer the protection provided by Henderson but carry a more sophisticated attacking contribution. That may sound overly optimistic, that may sound over-the-top when Mainoo has played such a limited amount of top-flight games.",
      "That might well prove to be the case but would there have been any harm in Southgate having a closer inspection of Mainoo’s undoubted talents? The England manager’s retort to that sort of question is normally to ask who would you leave out to make room for someone such as Mainoo.",
      "Well, he has EIGHT defenders in this squad, so maybe one of those. Mainoo has big tests coming up in a Manchester United shirt and he clearly has a lot of developing to do.",
      "But you cannot help but feel that if he wants to dispel this idea he is a conservative coach, Southgate has missed a trick with Mainoo.",

      "After early exits from the Champions League and Carabao Cup, the FA Cup provides Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag with his last hope of silverware this season",
      "Manchester United's players must prove they want Erik ten Hag to stay - by knocking arch rivals Liverpool out of the FA Cup.",
      "Ten Hag's hopes of keeping his job hinge on the FA Cup and securing a Champions League spot, although with United eight points adrift of fourth place, that latter target seems unlikely. That leaves the FA Cup as Ten Hag's last shot at redemption, with United legend Lou Macari believing Sunday's Old Trafford clash could be a make-or-break encounter for the Dutchman.",
      "“People are saying it’s a huge game for Ten Hag,” said Macari, who played a key role as United beat Liverpool in the 1977 FA Cup final to deny their old foes the Treble. “But it’s a huge game for everybody - players, fans and the club itself. A convincing win against Liverpool could go a long way to persuading people Ten Hag is the right man to stay in charge. That's the crazy thing. The manager's position is always under threat, but all managers – including Ten Hag - rely on their players.",
      "“You'd like to think that those who like him – and I don't think there would be many who dislike him – will be out there on Sunday, playing for their futures and the manager's future. You have managers at a club, and everyone's got an opinion on them, but you look for decency and you look for honesty.",
      "“Ten Hag seems like a decent, honest fellow, who's got to live with the results week-in, week-out,which hasn't been easy. But now's the time to get a big win – with everything that's at stake.",
      "“We all know what it's like at United – a fully committed performance from everybody is accepted. If you haven't managed to win, you're disappointed, but most fans would look upon it and say 'they didn't leave anything behind and gave it their all'. That's what's required on Sunday – and I don't think they can afford to lose.”",
      "United are currently sixth in the Premier League, with failed assaults on the Champions League and EFL Cup leaving the FA Cup as their only remaining chance of a trophy. But Macari, 74, believes there is still time to rescue the season – by beating Jurgen Klopp's side and giving United supporters something to cheer after such a difficult campaign.",
      "“It's been a difficult season for everybody,” said Macari. “For the club, the manager, players and fans. “Thankfully it's not over yet and there is a chance to salvage something from it and I'm sure that's the main priority for everyone at United – to grab what's left.",
      "“What's left is the FA Cup. You've got difficult opponents, but getting to Wembley, as I experienced four times at United, is a great day out for the fans who follow the team through thick and thin.",
      "“I just hope the players realise that they can do it, because the history of the FA Cup – not just between the two biggest clubs in the country – is full of upsets. When we beat Liverpool in the 1977 FA Cup final, to stop them doing the Treble, they were favourites to win and we were the underdogs.",
      "“It’s the same on Sunday. Even though we’re home, at Old Trafford, we’re the underdogs. People say the team's not good enough, but I've seen United teams that are struggling, then suddenly they get a big scalp and things can change.”",

      "\"The only thing that's been lacking is those weekly results that means there's a real buzz about the place. But they're capable of doing that.",

There was never anything like that sort of money available to us. The money, the facilities available to the players now, so much has changed from when I played.”",

      "Opposing Premier League clubs have stated that no such vote took place because a number of members believe it is important to know what the new financial regulations will look like",
      "Premier League clubs will take a vote on the ‘New Deal for Football’ when there is clarity over what the new financial restrictions in English football’s top tier will be.",
      "On Monday, the 20 Premier League member clubs met to discuss a £900million deal that would see more money flow from the top level into the EFL in the hope that an agreement over the long-running saga could be voted on ahead of the arrival of a new regulator in the game.",
      "However, that vote did not take place, with reports claiming that as many as 10 clubs were considering ditching the plans, and were even reportedly going as far as considering legal action should the government’s soon-to-be football regulator impose a deal upon them. The clubs in question were reported to be Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham, Aston Villa, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth.",
      "Talks turned to focus on the requirement for new financial regulations to be agreed upon that would replace the current profit and sustainability (PSR) rules that have come under scrutiny, with the Premier League looking at leaning more towards a model in line with UEFA’s squad cost ratio, where spend on transfers and wages against revenue as a percentage is what is assessed.",
      "At present, PSR allows clubs to lose £105m over three years, although investment in infrastructure, the women’s game, community initiatives, and the academy can all be deducted. Over the past 12 months, Everton have been charged twice and Nottingham Forest once, with Everton having been handed a 10-point deduction for the 2021/22 charge that was reduced to six upon appeal. Both they and Forest face fresh independent commission hearings over the 2022/23 breaches.",
      "But Mirror Football has spoken to sources at clubs opposed to voting without the new framework to replace PSR in place. They have stated that no such vote took place because a number of member clubs believe it is important to know what the new financial regulations will look like before agreeing to any new deal, also rejecting the notion that any kind of legal action against potential government intervention was being considered.",
      "A number of the clubs are believed to be concerned at being asked to take a vote when not in possession of the relevant information, although sources stated that there remained a willingness to agree a deal and be ‘good citizens’.",
      "It was February 29 when Premier League clubs last met to discuss the issue, but with the desire to bring about changes to PSR having escalated in recent months, there is likely to be little tangible progress until that is resolved.",
      "After the UK government confirmed a new independent body for English football in February, with one of the main focuses being the fair distribution through the pyramid from the Premier League, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer recently warned that the new ombudsman would intervene if a deal was not agreed.",
      "It is likely that talks over what replaces PSR don’t reach a conclusion until the summer, by which time the clubs who declined to vote on a new deal until the new rules believe they will be in a position to do so, with one club source describing it as ‘essential’ that transparency over the new regulations is provided before a vote on the ‘New Deal’ takes place.",

His consistency at right-back, however, could be derailed against Liverpool this weekend.

Does he start two out-and-out full backs - a luxury he has not had in two months - or persist with Victor Lindelof as an auxiliary left back? And who partners Raphael Varane? Jonny Evans's stock is so high again that United hit the skids when he limped off in the Manchester derby. A diligent recovery and ice baths ensured he started six days later against Everton.

Erik ten Hag was quizzed on United offering up so many shots after last weekend's win against Everton when the Toffees had 23 attempts. So what? That was the summation of his answer.

I do feel like there will be some changes, particularly with some of the players, but I also think that they will give the manager time. It's a tough one – United have had some legendary managers over the past 11 years and are yet to really get back to where they want to be, but I’d like to see Erik ten Hag stay and try and build a team – his team.

If he's smiling then he's going to shine on the pitch and it's really important for us that he can perform like this. He did it really well, especially in the last two games.

'Olympiakos moment' has since entered the United lexicon. Van Gaal's was Midtjylland, Mourinho's West Ham and Solskjaer's Liverpool.",

      "Buttner is settled and enjoying his football in the winter of his career. He has a little boy with his pregnant partner and a girl will be added to their family in two months.",
      "He achieved his dream of having a career as a professional footballer, but taking a quick glance at his social media will tell you which club he is most proud of playing for.",
      "Buttner signed for Manchester United in the summer of 2012, meaning he joined in the same year as Sir Alex Ferguson lifted his final Premier League title and announced his retirement.",
      "\"Normally you play FIFA with these kinds of players, so it was the greatest time of my life,\" Buttner, speaking to the Manchester Evening News after a De Graafschap training session, said when asked about playing alongside Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney.",
      "\"Robin van Persie signed in the same summer as me and I was happy he was there, so I could speak Dutch with him and it was great to play with these kind of big stars.",
      "\"Robin was one of the best in training. He scored lots of goals when we won the league and you could see he was special. He is one of the best players I've ever played with.\"",
      "Buttner was signed from Vitesse for £3.9million and Ferguson said at the time: \"Alexander is one of the best young left-backs in Europe and we're delighted to sign him. He's someone we've been watching for a while now. He gives us some really exciting options in that position.\"",
      "He was 23 and he was brought to the club to play a backup role to Patrice Evra, who was first choice at left-back. \"Patrice was a good friend of mine,\" Buttner explained. \"He tried to help me and I really appreciated that each day, trying to help me get better. He didn't see me as competition and we both tried to support each other and make the level higher.\"",
      "Buttner made his United debut in the third game of the 2012/13 campaign, and he scored and assisted against Wigan at Old Trafford in a comfortable 4-0 victory. The game represented Ferguson's 500th home league match and Scholes made his 700th appearance in a United shirt.",
      "\"It was special,\" Buttner said about his debut. \"Normally something like this only happens in a dream and for me, it was the best day of my life.",
      "\"My relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson was really good. He brought me to United and I was grateful for that. He was a really special coach and he knew everything about the players. He talked a lot with me and tried to make you feel at home. He was obviously really important for me and my time there.\"",
      "Buttner made 13 appearances in all competitions in his first season and five of those came in the Premier League, which meant he was entitled to a winner's medal. From the start of that campaign, the Premier League reduced the minimum number of appearances required for a league winner's medal from 10 to five.",
      "\"They [fringe players] will get medals, it's changed now,\" Ferguson said. \"Buttner's been great because he's travelled to every away game with us and been involved in every training session.\"",
      "A few weeks after United became champions for the 20th time, Ferguson gathered the players at Carrington to announce that he was retiring from management.",
      "The news leaked the night before, but hearing it from Ferguson's mouth still shocked the players. \"Normally he wouldn't come into the dressing room and the time he told us he was stopping was a moment that stunned us all. Everybody was quiet,\" Buttner said.",
      "\"Nobody talked and that reaction showed how important he was to all the players, so it was not a good moment for us because he is the greatest coach ever, albeit we understood it.\"",
      "Ferguson's last match was an enthralling 5-5 draw against West Brom, a game which Buttner scored in. \"This was a crazy game and the Boss' last before leaving,\" he said.",
      "When asked about the trophy parade in Manchester a week before that game at the Hawthorns, Buttner added: \"It was like we were living in a dream. Everything was perfect and when we won the league, it was crazy, everybody was celebrating and the whole city was red. The players, the fans, our families, we all came together to celebrate.\"",
      "In the spring of 2021, just after Buttner's stint with the New England Revolution in the States, he shared a photo on Instagram of a mural to honour Ferguson in his house.",
      "He was pictured holding the Premier League trophy with Ferguson in the dressing room during the title celebrations and he decided to commission a mural to commemorate the image, but it went viral on social media and the reaction among United fans was mixed.",
      "\"I remember when I posted the picture and it had thousands of comments,\" Buttner said. \"Most people said it was nice and of course, you got some who said it wasn't.",
      "\"For me, it's a special moment and he gave me the chance to play for this big club. I wanted to do something in my house for Manchester United on the wall and it was as one of the best pictures I had.\"",
      "David Moyes took over the reins and Buttner was diplomatic when quizzed on what went wrong for 'The Chosen One'. \"It's a really long time ago and it's a difficult one because I don't remember everything anymore,\" he said. \"I didn't put my focus on that because I just wanted to play football and I didn't speak about the coach and things, I just trained hard and played my games.\"",
      "The MEN caught up with Rene Muelensteen, Ferguson's former assistant, two weeks ago and he was asked for his memories of Buttner ahead of this interview being published.",
      "\"He’s a great guy, I loved my time when he was working with me at United,\" Muelensteen said. \"He’s an honest player and had really good attributes as a left-back.",
      "\"He had a strong left-foot, he was powerful and strong. Was he at the United level? He wasn’t the standard of Evra, but he was a fantastic person and he's still going strong.",
      "\"He's very good for the dressing room and I think when I left United, he took my car. I think it was one of those Chevrolet sports cars and f***, they were dangerous!\"",
      "Buttner laughed when he was informed of Muelensteen's motoring anecdote and although he struggled to recall it, he didn't have that problem when he was asked about playing against Liverpool at Old Trafford in September 2013.",
      "Unfortunately, Buttner didn't play for United in a Manchester derby during his time at the club, but he did get the opportunity to start against rivals Liverpool in the League Cup.",
      "\"I remember this game, it was really good,\" Buttner said. \"We won at home against Liverpool and it was great to win this match, also because we had one of the best teams around.",
      "\"Liverpool is a really good team too, and the games are never easy for United. I knew it was a really big game and during the time I was there, I felt the importance for the fans, players and club.\"",
      "Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard famously didn't win the Premier League and many have pointed out that's something Buttner has over the former midfielder. Buttner smiled and said: \"It's amazing to win the league and it's not easy because Gerrard, one of the biggest players in the world, didn't win it, which shows it's difficult.",
      "\"I still have the medal at home and nobody can take it away from me. I have it decorated in my house and I also have a small copy of the Premier League trophy.\"",
      "Buttner continued to be sporadically involved during Moyes' 10 months in charge and he left United in the same summer as fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal was appointed.",
      "\"I moved on because they signed Luke Shaw,\" he said. \"I wanted to play minutes somewhere else. I think it was a good choice to move, to make another step for my career.\"",
      "The defender spent three seasons at Dynamo Moscow after leaving United and eventually returned to the Netherlands, while he also had a spell with New England in the MLS.",
      "\"Yeah, I'm proud,\" Buttner said about his career. \"It's a dream for every player to play for Manchester United and it was also my dream. Nobody can ever take away those years.",
      "\"Every day that I played for such a big club was special and that's why I put Ferguson in my house - he gave me the chance to do it. I've played for big clubs and I'm finally home now.",
      "\"I play in my hometown, where I was born, and when I quit football, I'm going to watch one game at every club I played for, stay a little bit in those places, and see people again because I don't have time for that now. For sure, one day, I will come back to Manchester.\"",
      "Buttner briefly but warmly spoke about his family at the end of the interview. He will show his children his Premier League winner's medal when they're old enough.",

      "Man Utd face Liverpool in a crucial FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford this weekend, 25 years after their meeting in this competition sparked United's run to an historic treble.",
      "The idea of Manchester United winning the treble was almost over before it had even taken hold. It was January in 1999 and inside Old Trafford it was 8,000 Liverpool fans making all the noise.",
      "Michael Owen's third-minute header had Gerard Houllier's team on course for an FA Cup fourth-round win, leaving United to focus on a tense title race and their ongoing efforts to conquer Europe. Just two minutes were left to play.",
      "At this stage of the season. nobody was really talking about the treble. United had won just five of their last 14 games in all competitions and in the third round of the cup, they had been 1-0 down to Middlesbrough with 22 minutes to play before winning 3-1.",
      "Old Trafford wasn't on the edge of its seat because the treble dream was dying. The fans were going through the mill because of the prospect of Liverpool winning on enemy territory in a knockout game. But then, everything changed.",
      "Alex Ferguson, pre-Knighthood, had thrown on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to play alongside Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole, moving to three at the back. As United piled the pressure on, Yorke equalised after 88 minutes and Solskjaer won it just over a minute into injury time. At the time, little did anybody realise just how important that win - and the manner of it - would turn out to be.",
      "***",
      "\"The season really started with the Liverpool game,\" said Gary Neville. Looking back, it is the moment the dream of winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League began to crystalise. It is a valuable barometer not just for surviving in the cup, but for showing that ability to rescue games from almost impossible situations that would prove so invaluable as the season progressed.",
      "The start was a nightmare, however. Owen rising unmarked in front of the Stretford End to head in Vegard Heggem's cross. On the touchline, Ferguson was furious that a 5ft 6ins striker would be allowed a free header so early in such a big game.",
      "Liverpool had their chances on the break but United bean to turn the screw. Roy Keane hit the post twice, had one shot deflected narrowly wide and then a young Jamie Carragher blocked a Ryan Giggs effort that looked destined for the corner. \"This is Liverpool's day,\" roared Andy Gray on commentary. Denis Irwin said United had \"thrown the kitchen sink at it\" and Yorke later said he felt was going to be \"one of those days.\"",
      "Not so fast.",
      "Liverpool had already lost Paul Ince, who asked to come off with a back injury with 20 minutes left. The former United midfielder cupped his ear to the Old Trafford faithful but in the technical area, his manager was even more unhappy. Houllier felt Ince should have played through the pain barrier and it was an early strain in a relationship that never warmed up.",
      "With nine minutes to play, it was Ferguson's time to make a change. Irwin saw his number go up. It wasn't a surprise. The full-back had become accustomed to Ferguson always taking the gamble to win a game. On this occasion, it was Solskjaer who replaced him in a move that quite clearly signalled all out attack. It was Giggs, Keane, Paul Scholes and David Beckham behind Solskjaer, Yorke and Cole.",
      "It eventually paid off. Jamie Redknapp was adjudged to have fouled Ronny Johnsen, although Liverpool were furious at the decision. Beckham floated the free-kick to the back post, Cole headed it across goal and Yorke tapped in from a couple of yards out. On the touchline, Ferguson jumped up in delight and then raced back to the dugout, up the steps and into the arms of assistant Jim Ryan.",
      "The atmosphere was electric now but a replay at Anfield was the last thing on United's minds. Jaap Stam floated a ball in from deep, Scholes managed to control it towards Solskjaer, who took a couple of touches and then slotted past David James with his left foot. The Norwegian felt it was the only time he touched the ball in his match-winning cameo.",
      "\"After we’d equalised, we just go straight up again. Jaap hoofs a ball up in behind, Scholesy gets it, so I run into his path, really, and just take the ball off him,\" Solskjaer told United's website.",
      "\"I use one touch to take it off him, one touch to set myself, and then another to shoot through Jamie Carragher’s legs. Those are the only touches I had in that game, I think.",
      "\"Sometimes you’ve just got to make the most of it as a sub. That was my job whenever I came on: to be in and around the box. I wasn’t there to create chances for everyone else, I was just there to smell where the ball was going to land and that’s where I was probably better than most.\"",
      "After the game, Ferguson was already talking about coming back in matches and the character within his team, traits that would both prove vital to the treble that would eventually be delivered at the end of May.",
      "“We had witnessed a demonstration of the morale that was to be every bit as vital as rich skill in the five months that lay ahead of United,” he later wrote in his first autobiography. “Tactics are important but they don’t win football matches. Men win football matches.",
      "\"The best teams stand out because they are teams, because the individual members have been so truly integrated that the team functions with a single spirit. The Manchester United of 1999 had talent by the bundle but there was nothing about them that I admired or valued more than their team spirit.\"",
      "\"We had some magical moments within that season, but that was incredible,\" said Yorke. \"We were one-nil down with two or three minutes to play, we were just pushing and thought it was one of those days and we weren’t going to score at all. But then everything changed. Liverpool had played well, defended well and they thought they’d won, but then we snatched it from them.\"",
      "The atmosphere in the dressing room afterwards was a mixture of relief and euphoria. It became the kind of game synonymous with United's 1998/99 treble, when they would constantly rescue games from losing positions or win matches in the most head-scathingly incredible circumstances.",
      "More remarkable comebacks would follow, most notably in Turin against Juventus in the Champions League semi-final second leg, against Tottenham on the final day of the league season and then in the Nou Camp on Wednesday, May 26, 1999, when they left it even later than they had against Liverpool. By now the muscle memory was so strong that they always had the belief a turnaround was on the cards.",
      "“To beat Liverpool this way is better than beating them 5-0, I think,\" Solskjaer said when interviewed on TV straight after the FA Cup win. \"It’s the best way to win a football game in the last minute.”",
      "You didn't yet know the half of it, Ole.",

      "Manchester United's wastefulness in the transfer market has been laid bare",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United, but quite how long it will be until some real green shoots of recovery will appear is an unknown.",
      "There hasn’t been too many cases of a minority stake in a football club being acquired as there has been with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s purchase of 27.7% of the club, a deal that was ratified in January.",
      "The reason for that, of course, is that Ratcliffe and his INEOS team have been handed football oversight as a result of the deal, the absentee ownership of the Glazer family seemingly more than happy to pass over that particular baton.",
      "The last time that Manchester United won a Premier League title was in 2013, the final season of Sir Alex Ferguson’s illustrious reign.",
      "Since then the club has seen David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, Ralf Rangnick, and now Erik ten Hag in the dugout. Aside from the odd bright spot here and there, it has been a case of rinse and repeat, where the club pivots from manager to manager and hopes for a different outcome without addressing the root cause of the problem why there has been such failure.",
      "Football has changed immeasurably even since when Ferguson was at the helm last. For many years now clubs have invested in putting the right people in the right places behind the scenes to focus on the underlying numbers and data when entering the transfer market. United have flirted with it, but it has never been the identity of the club or a thread that can be pulled through regardless of who is in the hot seat.",
      "A lack of a sporting director has been one of the many things that the Glazers have neglected to address. That is something that Ratcliffe has sought to do immediately, with the man who was key to Brighton & Hove Albion’s successful recruitment policy, Dan Ashworth, likely to arrive from Newcastle United once a deal is agreed. The hiring of one of the men who helped shape Manchester City's transfer strategy, Omar Berrada, as CEO is also a sign of what is to come.",
      "United’s recruitment policy has not moved with the times, and Ten Hag is proof of that.",
      "The Dutchman has leaned towards players that he knows, with three of those coming directly from the Eredivisie and several others having spent time playing in Dutch football’s top tier. It has been a case of the manager largely determining transfer policy, and that, while something that was commonplace some years ago, is no longer the path to success.",
      "Managers come and go, and when such churn occurs it forms a squad of players who were favoured by former bosses that have been foisted on a new one, and so the cycle continues ad nauseum.",
      "At the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London last month, where the MEN were present, data was presented that gave a breakdown of how much spend per minute the biggest clubs had in terms of the output of their squads, and it gave insight into United’s flawed approach.",
      "Transfer spend has long been used as a yardstick for social media to equate ambition. Liverpool’s transfer spend has been considerably lower than their rivals under Fenway Sports Group, and that is largely the biggest gripe of supporters towards the owners on Merseyside. But Manchester United have spent in the transfer market under the Glazers, and the wage bill has risen to huge levels also. The lack of success has continued, however.",
      "The FT data pointed to the clubs that had a defined strategy spending less per minute on their players, largely through better use of data to determine whether or not a player fits into a system as well as how injury-prone they are. In the case of someone like Mohamed Salah, he has rarely had to suffer a spell on the sidelines.",
      "Liverpool, the data showed, £4,524 per minute played, based on share of maximum minutes played by signings since 2015/16. The real successes were Salah, Alisson Becker, and Virgil van Dijk, while the misses were the likes of Naby Keita and Christian Benteke.",
      "Arsenal came in as having a £5,410 per minute played spend, while Manchester City’s stood at £6,927 per minute played. In the case of City, it is worth pointing out that the City strategy is to run with a large squad of world-class players across the positions.",
      "United came in at £7,624 per minute played, the second highest among the ‘Big Six’. The success stories in terms of players featuring, in terms of percentage, were the likes of Andre Onana and Bruno Fernandes, but there were several big-name players where price versus playing time fell well below the 50% mark.",
      "Of those to be below the 50% mark, Donny van de Beek, Antony, Mason Mount, Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Jadon Sancho, and Paul Pogba all featured prominently. Big ticket players who offered little value in relation to how often they found minutes on the pitch.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Chelsea’s £1bn splurge on players since they were taken over by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, has them at a £10,801 per minute played spend, a figure more than double that of the likes of Liverpool, a club they are seeking to chase down and overtake in years to come.",
      "For United, the figures show just why Ratcliffe is so keen to address the wastefulness of the club in the market, and why he wants to waste little time getting the people in place that can help achieve that goal.",

The Merseysiders have already scooped the Carabao Cup and are still in the conversation to win the Premier League title and the Europa League, in addition to the FA Cup.",
      "For United, the FA Cup represents their last hope of winning any silverware this season, meaning it is being dubbed as the biggest game of their season so far by some. With their top four hopes fading, winning the FA Cup may represent their only hope of this season being considered a success.",
      "United are unbeaten in two of their three matches against Liverpool under Erik ten Hag, drawing 0-0 at Anfield in the Premier League in December and beating them 2-1 at Old Trafford in the third game of last season, securing the Dutchman his first win as Reds manager. No doubt mindful of those previous meetings, Van Dijk is not underestimating United.",

      "\"We always have difficult games against them and I expect a difficult one on Sunday as well. They are finding ways to win but I focus on what we have to do against them. It's always difficult, it's always intense.",

      "United set up with a defensive-minded approach when they travelled to Anfield shortly before Christmas, no doubt mindful of the 7-0 drubbing they had experienced on their last visit to the red half of Merseyside. They shut up shop that afternoon, making it difficult for Liverpool to find a way through.",
      "Van Dijk does not believe they will be able to use the same approach on Sunday, adding: \"I think the game here was, I wouldn't say one-sided but we had a lot of the ball. They created a couple of dangerous moments on the break and we have to be aware of that but if they would do it exactly the same when they play at home, I have no idea.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe branded Newcastle \"silly\", \"stupid\" and \"absurd\" for reputedly demanding a fee as much as £20million for Ashworth. United sources said last month they would not pay £10m to recruit the 53-year-old.",
      "Although Ashworth's move from Brighton to Newcastle in 2022 was widely reported as £4m, a well-placed source said Newcastle paid \"significantly less\" than that figure for the former FA director of elite development.",

      "\"I think Dan Ashworth is clearly one of the top sporting directors in the world, I've no doubt,\" Ratcliffe said last month. \"He's a very capable person. He's interested in the Manchester United job because it's probably the biggest sporting director job in the world just now, with the biggest challenge.",

      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "Man Utd showed character to hold on and get a good point away at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Ryan Giggs will be forever etched into the Manchester United history books, but his chapter is not without blemish.",
      "Cowbridge Road in west Cardiff plays a significant role in Manchester United's history, although you would hardly know it today.",
      "Walk along the street and you will eventually come to a Grade II Listed building that now houses a number of residents. The original site of St David’s Hospital has been turned into accommodation but just over 50 years ago it was the birthplace of a United pioneer.",
      "Ryan Wilson, the grandson of a Sierra Leone national and the son of a Welsh rugby professional, was a typical sporty child of his era. He was often seen playing both football and rugby outside of his Pentrebane home.",
      "He moved to Manchester aged six when his father changed codes, transitioning from rugby union to join rugby league outfit Swinton FC. The youngster found the changes tough and often visited his grandparents back in Cardiff but Manchester was where he would forge his own name.",
      "At the age of 16, the teenager’s surname changed to Giggs after his mother remarried following the split of his parents. By then, he had left any rugby league ambitions behind and was more than catching the eye on the football pitch.",
      "A few years earlier, he had been scouted into the Manchester City academy by milkman Dennis Schofield but United has caught wind of the Welsh talent and snapped him up on his 14th birthday on 29 November 1987 after impressing in a trial the year prior.",
      "“I enjoyed [Man City] but I was a United fan!” Giggs later admitted. “I remember turning up in a red top and was made to take it off! I’d wanted to play for United from an early age.”",
      "During his early schooldays, Giggs had played for Salford Boys and scored a hat-trick as Sir Alex Ferguson watched on from his office at The Cliffe. Before signing on for United, he had won man of the match while captaining his side to the Granada Schools Cup trophy at Anfield, being handed the cup by Liverpool FC chief scout Ron Yeats.",
      "He went on to skipper England schoolboys and played against Germany at Wembley in 1989. Rules at the time would not allow him to play for the England senior side but school-level criteria was purely based on where a child was having his education.",
      "International eligibility rules would change some 30 years later but Giggs was always adamant that \"I'd rather go through my career without qualifying for a major championship than play for a country where I wasn't born or which my parents didn't have anything to do with\".",
      "In his 12 months with England schoolboys, he captained the side to seven wins in nine games, one of which came in a 4-0 triumph over Wales, against players whom he would play with the following year.",
      "After continuing to impress at United, Giggs penned his first professional contract on 1 December 1990, two days after his 17th birthday. His league debut came 15 months down the line when he came on for an injured Denis Irwin against Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Giggs officially recorded his first goal in the May 1991 Manchester derby, despite ambiguity after a big deflection. That October, he became the youngest ever player to feature for the Wales national team at 17 years and 321 days when he played the final six minutes away in Germany, a record that would stand for eight years.",
      "He had become a regular for United at that stage, although remained part of the famous youth squad that went on to lift the 1992 FA Youth Cup.",
      "Giggs clasped hands on his maiden piece of senior silverware in April of that year when he set up Brian McClair for the 1-0 League Cup final win over Nottingham Forest, having scored the winner against Middlesbrough in the semi-final.",
      "In 1993, Giggs became a fixture in the starting XI and helped United win their first top-league title for 26 years in the inaugural Premier League campaign. A few months earlier, he had bagged his first goal for Wales by scoring in a 3-0 World Cup qualifying fixture against Belgium, a match in which Ian Rush netted for a record 24th time.",
      "Squad inclusions became a hot point of discussion for Wales fans amid frequent squad withdrawals in the years afterwards. Giggs later explained: \"At that time, whenever I played two games in one week I always seemed to pick up an injury, so [Alex Ferguson] and I sat down and looked at it game by game. If the international was a friendly, the feeling was that I didn't have to play.”",
      "Sir Alex was fairly protective of Giggs in his early days, and only allowed him to do his first interview aged 20 when he spoke to the great Des Lynam for Match of the Day in the double-winning 1993/94 season.",
      "Perhaps he saw what was coming down the track. The Premier League had started to take a life of its own where footballers were now becoming celebrities and being offered lucrative commercial opportunities.",
      "Giggs was offered the chance to host his own TV show - Ryan Giggs’ Soccer School - in 1994 and shortly afterwards released a book on the series. Magazine covers, more TV interviews and wall posters all added to the new-found razzmatazz he and the game acquired.",
      "Later on, Giggs would be on the cover of the console game FIFA 2003 alongside Edgar Davids and Roberto Carlos, and his profile was a great asset for UNICEF, for whom he became an ambassador in 2006.",
      "On the pitch, the superlatives continued to flow for a young Giggs. He was likened to Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best, both of whom described Giggs their favourite player and how it was a joy to watch him in training.",
      "\"One day they might even say that I was another Ryan Giggs,” Best was once quoted as saying. Giggs would soon etch his name into not just United history but football folklore.",
      "His most famous goal was THAT solo effort against Arsenal in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay - a crucial moment in the Treble-winning season and the last ever goal in a semi-final replay, which were scrapped after that campaign.",
      "Giggs, of course, played his part in the unforgettable Champions League final comeback too, setting up Teddy Sheringham’s equaliser. Three years on, he bagged his 100th goal for United against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the first many personal milestones.",
      "It wasn’t all dandelions and flowers, though. He was one to be booed off the pitch in the 2003 League Cup semi-final first leg draw with Blackburn, and soon heard sneering chants of “give it to Giggsy” from Arsenal fans after missing an open goal in the 2-0 FA Cup defeat.",
      "Not a week later, then-United CEO Peter Kenyon refused to rule out an exit for Giggs amid outside views that the winger’s best days were behind him. Reports at the time speculated that a rift had formed in the dressing room.",
      "However, Giggs responded by netting twice in a 3-0 Champions League win over Juventus in a match that would be one of his best personal games. Giggs insisted he wanted to stay at United the following summer and a year later lifted his fourth FA Cup.",
      "It was no secret that injuries had worried staff in yesteryear but his hamstrings problems had seemed to reside in recent seasons - something Giggs credited as down to his yoga sessions.",
      "Ahead of the new season, he would sign a two-year extension, causing United chief David Gill to go back on his stance of not giving contracts longer than a year to players north of 30. The following February, he produced perhaps one of the most bizarre moments of his career.",
      "In a Champions League knock-out game against Lille, Giggs took a quick free-kick with the home players not yet set. The goal stood and Lille players walked off in protest, seething at the referee and leaving Giggs and his teammates baffled. UEFA backed United and said the goal was legitimate.",
      "Giggs would then set a new record of nine English league titles when he lifted the Premier League trophy in 2007. That same May, he announced his retirement from international football as he put his full focus on United.",
      "His Wales playing career came to a close on 2 June 2007, captaining his team in a goalless draw with the Czech Republic. He earned 64 caps for his country, scoring 12 times.",
      "By 2009, after the 2008 Champions League triumph in Moscow, Sir Alex had started playing Giggs more centrally behind the striker as he ticked past his 35th birthday. “At 25, Ryan would shatter defenders with his run down the flank, but at 35, he will play deeper,” Sir Alex explained.",
      "By then, Giggs had started thinking about a career in coaching. But it was a poignant playing year for the veteran. He was named PFA Player of the Year and won Sports Personality of the Year within a few short breaths.",
      "Within the preceding months to those accolades, he netted his only hat-trick for United in a pre-season friendly against Chinese outfit Hangzhou Greentown before notching his 100th Premier League goal in November's 4-1 win over Portsmouth.",
      "All that and it was only in November 2010 at age 36 did he score his first penalty for United - scoring two of them in the same match against Tottenham. That season, he would play in his last Champions League final, as United lost 3-1 to Barcelona at Wembley in May 2011.",
      "While Giggs' exploits on the pitch were public knowledge, he fought to keep his private life out of the public eye, in sharp contrast to his old team-mate David Beckham. Celebrity was not for him. He wedded long term partner Stacey Cooke, in a low key ceremony at the Lowry Hotel in 2007. the ceremony attended by close friends and family only.",
      "Rumours of Giggs' infidelity became a feature of tabloid speculation, however. It was one such tabloid story which was the catalyst for Giggs fighting an extraordinary legal battle to try and keep an alleged affair secret. In 2011 Giggs took out an injunction at the High Court in a bid to stop a national newspaper revealing details of an alleged fling with the ex-Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas.",
      "After the paper ran a story without naming the Premier League footballer alleged to have conducted the affair, rumours spread like wildfire on Twitter. Eventually Giggs was named in Parliament by an MP as the footballer, using parliamentary privilege which protects MPs from libel claims.",
      "Even more shocking, however, was the revelation that he had been involved in a secret affair with brother Rhodri’s wife Natasha for eight years. Rhodri said in 2019 that his relationship with his sibling and family had shattered as a result. Giggs later divorced his wife of 10 years Stacey Cooke in 2017.",
      "It was another twist in a complicated family life. Originally born in Cardiff to his father Danny Wilson, a rugby player, and his mother Lynne, a nurse, the family were uprooted to the North West after his dad signed for the Swinton rugby league team.",
      "\"Ryan wasn’t planned but I was happy when he came along,\" recalled Danny last year. \"But I was 18, still going out with my mates. I wasn’t ready for fatherhood.\"",
      "Danny eventually moved out, after a number of affairs, in 1985 when Ryan was just 12. His parents reconciled briefly, before separating again in 1988. Ryan eventually changed his surname from Wilson to Giggs, his mother's maiden name, and has only seen his father once in 34 years.",
      "Despite the tumultuous personal life, his career continued to go from strength to strength. The 2012 London Olympics offered Giggs a unique opportunity. He captained Team GB’s first men's side at the Games since 1960 as one of three over-aged players, and became the event’s oldest ever goalscorer aged 38 and 243 days when he headed home against the UAE.",
      "A year later, he made more fresh steps, this time away from the pitch. He partnered up with United colleague Gary Neville to form a vision of building a series of football-themed hotels and cafes around the UK with Hotel Football in Stretford opening in March 2015.",
      "Beforehand, he had reached a huge and historic football milestone in 2013, earning his 1,000th competitive career appearance in a 2-1 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in what is an astonishing achievement. But that summer, Sir Alex would retire and Giggs was not too far behind either.",
      "His dreams about coaching became reality sooner than expected when successor David Moyes made him player-coach. Giggs would step in as interim when Moyes was sacked the following April and managed two wins, a draw and a loss in his four games.",
      "He later admitted that he heavily felt the pressure of being a United manager and at one stage broke down in tears after many sleepless nights. But that did not stop him from becoming a part of Louis van Gaal’s backroom staff in 2014 after announcing his playing career was over.",
      "Thirteen titles make him the most successful Premier League player of all-time to this day. He remains United’s all-time top appearance-maker on 963 games and has a cabinet of four FA Cups, three League Cups, two Champions Leagues, a Club World Cup, a UEFA Super Cup and nine Community Sheilds. Giggs would leave United's backroom staff in 2016 upon the appointment of Jose Mourinho.",
      "In the same year of his retirement, he became part-owner of Salford City - scoring a subsequent panenka penalty in a Class of '92 & Friends XI friendly at a sold-out AJ Bell Stadium. The club eventually accomplished their goal of reaching the Football League for the first time in 2019.",
      "In September 2017, Giggs, Neville and other Class of '92 stars proposed the idea of a university in Greater Manchester which would offer \"broader courses than traditional degrees\". The University Academy 92 first opened in September 2019.",
      "Giggs got his full-time coaching break in 2018 when he was appointed Wales head coach in the January. His first match that March saw Wales romp to a 6-0 win over China, in which Gareth Bale surpassed Ian Rush’s previous national goal record in a real full-circle moment.",
      "His final game in charge was the 2-0 win over Hungary in November 2019 that saw Wales qualify for Euro 2020, which ultimately became delayed due to the Covid pandemic.",
      "Giggs would never manage the side at the competition after being arrested in November 2020 on suspicion of two counts of assault against ex-girlfriend, PR executive Kate Greville, and her younger sister Emma. He always denied the charges against him, which were officially levelled in April 2021.",
      "Rob Page took over Wales on a temporary basis before being made a permanent appointment when Giggs - who has won 12 of his 25 games - stepped down in June 2022.",
      "His trial began on 8 August 2022 and on 31 August, the 11-person jury were discharged after being unable to reach a verdict. In July 2023, two weeks before Giggs was due to face a retrial, The Crown Prosecution Service said that charges had been withdrawn, with the complainant unwilling to give evidence in the said retrial.",
      "The trial, however, had been a PR disaster for Giggs. In court, he confessed that he had never been faithful either to his ex wife Stacey, with whom he has two children, Libby, 20, and Zach, 16, or to any of his other girlfriends. His reputation was in tatters, a liar and a cheat by his own admission.",
      "He was last seen out dating model Zara Charles, who he began a relationship with in 2021, but has mainly kept a low profile since the court case. He has been carrying out some speaking arrangements in private functions.",
      "Giggs is now back in football, having been appointed as a football director at Salford City. His son, Zach, is currently playing in Sheffield United’s youth system having made the switch from United’s academy last summer.",
      "The next academy debutant will be the 250th youth graduate to have made the transition to the first-team. Giggs stands out as one, if not the, most memorable. Not always for his performances on the pitch now, unfortunately."

      "All the latest Manchester United gossip as Sir Jim Ratcliffe plots his first transfer window since taking the reins at Old Trafford",
      "The January transfer window may have slammed shut a couple of months ago, but there's still plenty of life left in the rumour mill at Manchester United. With Sir Jim Ratcliffe determined to relive the glory days at Old Trafford, United are expected to undergo a spending spree in the summer.",
      "Numerous players have already been heavily linked with moves to Manchester United – some of which could command a hefty fee. Elsewhere, Erik ten Hag currently faces an uncertain future with his contract at Carrington set to expire at the end of next season – and a few big-name replacements have been mooted.",
      "In the meantime, the Dutch will be determined to prove himself to Ratcliffe and deliver a maiden piece of silverware. Manchester United face Liverpool in the FA Cup quarterfinal this weekend and, with top four unlikely at the moment, this could be Ten Hag's last chance to impress.",
      "So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at some of the latest transfer news coming out of Old Trafford.",
      "Erik ten Hag has insisted Marcus Rashford it not for sale. The 26-year-old forward has been heavily linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain for a while now as the French giants look to replace Kylian Mbappe, who's set to leave Les Parc des Princes in the summer.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Friday afternoon, the Manchester United boss ruled out Rashford's departure. He said: \"We did not sign him last season for four years with the intention to sell him now. He should be part of this project. It is not a subject we don't talk about.\"",
      "In the summer, Rashford penned a new contract which keeps him at Old Trafford until 2028. And, in December 2020, he also claimed that he can only see himself playing for Manchester United, insisting it 'wouldn't sit right' with him to wear another club's shirt.",
      "Gareth Southgate has revealed that he has 'shelved' contract negotiations with the FA, at his request, until after the European Championships this summer. The England boss, who sees his contract at Wembley Stadium expire in December 2024, has been linked with replacing Erik ten Hag at Manchester United.",
      "\"I think we would have to sit and think about that at the end of the tournament,\" said Southgate, when quizzed on his future in the Three Lions setup. \"I’m happy to talk about it briefly now, but I’m not going to talk about it for the whole summer, what’s next?",
      "\"We’ve consciously shelved any discussions internally about what might be next because I think if we had sat and signed a new contract and done that before the tournament, everybody would have said, 'Well, you did this with Capello and you should be proving yourself before you sign'.",
      "\"So, look, I’m completely relaxed about that and I have no idea where we’ll be in the middle of July, other than I hope it’s Trafalgar Square and let’s get the party on.\"",
      "According to Spanish publication Marca, United have given Mason Greenwood a €50million (£42.8m) asking price ahead of the summer transfer window. The report states that the 22-year-old forward has courted the interest of Barcelona, who are said to be long-term admirers.",
      "Greenwood, who sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in 2025, has featured 23 times for Getafe in La Liga this season, scoring six goals and providing three assists. While he's managed to catch the Catalan side's eye, Marca claim that United's valuation has all but ruled out a move to the Camp Nou.",

      "Onana was late joining up with his international teammates in January after staying on to play in Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham at Old Trafford. Cameroon kicked off less than 24 hours after the full-time whistle and the goalkeeper took a private flight over to host country the Ivory Coast.",
      "Weather delays meant Onana only joined up with the squad a few hours before kick-off against Guinea and, despite his long and rushed travels, the shot-stopper was left out of the team. Onana played in the 3-1 defeat to Senegal but was benched for the final group win over The Gambia and last-16 defeat to Nigeria.",
      "Onana had reversed his retirement decision earlier this season, after his arrival at United, having previously fallen out with Song. The manager - who guided Cameroon to a shock 1-0 win over Brazil at the 2022 World Cup - has since been dismissed from his role.",
      "Senegal star Diouf has blasted Song for his treatment of Onana - who has eight league clean sheets this season, the second-highest tally - and accused him of being disrespectful to the 27-year-old. He told Canal+, as per Afrique Sports: “André Onana is someone I respect a lot and I congratulate him for what he does and his commitment to his team.",

      "His scathing assessment contrasts to his comments made during the tournament about Onana’s late arrival. “Cameroon have gone backwards,” he said as quoted by Foot Mercato.",

      "In July 2023, Rashford signed a new contract which keeps him at Manchester United until 2028. The 26-year-old earns around £325,000 a week, making him one of the club's highest earners.",
      "In December 2022, Nasser Al-Khelaifi admitted that PSG are long admirers of Marcus Rashford. The Parisians' president told Sky Sports News: \"He's another player that is really amazing. And for free?",
      "\"To have Rashford for free, every club would run after him, definitely. We're not hiding it, we spoke before and… interest. But the moment was not a good moment for both sides. Maybe, summer, why not?",
      "\"Today if he's a free agent of course we can talk to him directly but we are not going to talk to him now. Let him focus on the World Cup. Then after in January, hopefully, if we're interested we will talk to him.\"",
      "Back in December 2020, Rashford claimed he can only see himself playing for Manchester United. Upon winning the Sport for Social Change award at British Sports Awards for his campaign against child poverty, the Englishman insisted it 'wouldn't sit right' with him to wear another club's shirt.",
      "\"For me, I never look beyond Manchester United,\" he said. \"As a kid I've never looked beyond Manchester United in my mind, it wouldn't sit right for me to be pulling on another shirt. I just want to do the best I can for the club whilst I'm here, so hopefully I'm here for the long term.\"",
      "Last month he reaffirmed that commitment in an article for The Players Tribune.",
      "\"Listen, I’m not a perfect person. When I make a mistake, I’ll be the first one to put my hand up and say that I need to do better,\" he told The Players' Tribune. \"But if you ever question my commitment to Man United, that’s when I have to speak up. It’s like somebody questioning my entire identity, and everything I stand for as a man. I grew up here. I have played for this club since I was a boy. My family turned down life-changing money when I was a kid so I could wear this badge.\"",
      "He added: \"I promise you, the world has not seen the best of this United squad and these players. We want to be back playing in the Champions League, then we have a massive international tournament at the end of the season. We will be back where we belong. We just have to keep working, and that starts with me.",
      "\"If you back me, good. If you doubt me, even better.\"",
      "With Ten Hag's comments that Rashford 'should be part of this project', the forward may just get the chance to keep his promise of getting United 'back where they belong'.",

      "The two rivals meet on Sunday in a 3.30pm kick-off with the Anfield side coming off the back of a thumping Europa League win over Sparta Prague on Thursday night. United, meanwhile, will have had eight days between games, having beaten Everton 2-0 in their last encounter.",
      "Klopp says that Erik ten Hag's preparations will have been detailed, with extra time to work on a gameplan and the return of key men like Rasmus Hojlund, Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. However, he believes the return of his own star player, Mo Salah, to form and fitness could be the deciding factor in front of a full house at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We can have 90,000 people, Manchester United, yeah, ask me after it if I enjoy,\" said Klopp. \"We will try to prepare. Again we have a situation where we have played Thursday and we handled it.",
      "\"United have had a full week to prepare. Ten Hag knows how to play so he will line-up some challenges but we have to be ready anyway. As much as it's possible, I enjoy [these games].",

      "For the first time since New Year's Day, Salah was named in the starting line-up on Thursday night for Klopp's side. The Egypt international made his first start since sustaining an injury while away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations, having been brought off the bench against Man City on Sunday.",
      "He had an impact in midweek, netting Liverpool's third and playing the full 90 minutes. He now looks set to start against United and Klopp warned he is raring to go.",
      "“Mo is pure quality,” he said. “Ask him what he likes against Manchester United but the more we talk about it the less likely it is going to happen so I don't like to talk too much.",
      "\"An unbelievable player. The boys did well [without him] but it's better to have him around the pitch.",
      "\"Mo is definitely ready [for Sunday]. Konate hasn't trained today, we'll have to see if he can train tomorrow. A tight, tight race that we will probably lose. Bobby Clark has some swelling, Gravenberh trained today so he is ready. Others after the break.\"",

      "A new transfer policy will be high on the agenda for Omar Berrada as soon as he arrives at Man Utd.",
      "A key issue for Manchester United this summer will not only be to overhaul their playing squad, it will also be to overhaul their wage bill, with a number of high-earning players set to be moved on.",
      "Raphael Varane, Anthony Martial, Christian Eriksen and Aaron Wan-Bissaka could easily be sold this summer while they could also field offers for Casemiro and a senior defender like Harry Maguire or Victor Lindelof.",
      "According to Spotrac, they are among the highest earners at the club and could cut as much as £77million off the annual wage bill, though it must be said that those figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the very nature of the speculation.",
      "It certainly offers plenty of food for thought, particularly for Omar Berrada, United's new chief executive, who will be tasked with ensuring the correct structure is implemented across all areas of the club.",
      "Berrada's job will not be to tell the club how to spend their money or which players to target, but he will be in charge of enforcing their negotiating power and ensuring that United do not overpay for players.",
      "It will likely be up to him to evaluate the value of a prospective new signing and ensure that United stick to their principles and are not taken advantage of by overpaying for individuals.",
      "Speaking ahead of taking the Old Trafford role, he warned why overpaying clubs, players, and agents in the transfer market can lead to teams finding themselves on a \"slippery slope\". United have been sliding for a decade.",
      "While United will certainly be looking to initially cut their wage bill this summer, it does not mean that they will be cautious to spend it as a result. Berrada is happy to sanction big deals if they represent value for money; just look at his time with City.",
      "Last season, City became the first club in British football history to spend more than £400 million on annual wages, in part due to the mammoth £45 million annual salary of Erling Haaland. United's was £91.8 million lower, but that does not mean that they had spent it well.",
      "\"If you have a very solid rationale as to why you're offering the fee, the salary and the commission, they might not agree with it but they will accept it,\" Berrada told the Financial Times two months ago.",
      "\"Once you start overpaying then you lose that argument and that puts you in a much more difficult position to say to the next one, 'I can only offer you this.'\".",
      "United have long been accused of spending recklessly in the transfer market and operating without a long-term plan in mind. They will quickly fluctuate between different targets and end up paying far more money than a player is worth. A 'United tax' is something they have to contend with, but Berrada has already had to operate with a 'City tax' working against him as well.",
      "A key part of his success at the Etihad Stadium was the work done by Txiki Begiristain, who would oversee the football side of things, before Berrada's business brain was engaged.",
      "For him to have half as much success on the red half of Manchester, another leading sporting director will be required, and that is exactly what United are trying to do with their pursuit of Dan Ashworth.",
      "As well as the record wage bill for the triumphant 2022–23 season, Berrada also helped deliver annual revenues of £712 million, more than United's, which stood at £648 million.",
      "He believes the on-field success of Pep Guardiola's side was a key reason behind that, but the two are deeply interlinked, given that the success was built upon their successful sporting structure and recruitment policy.",
      "\"The commercial growth of the clubs is predicated or underpinned by success on the pitch,\" he explained. \"If you have a really good business strategy alongside it, then it just turbocharges the growth off the pitch.\"",
      "Berrada will only be a success as part of a wider structural overhaul, and that structural change will only be a success if he is given the power to do his job.",
      "He won't tell them how to spend their money, but he could give them an immediate £77 million boost to help.",

      "Mainoo, 18, made his full Premier League debut on November on November 26 and he has appeared 22 times for Manchester United since his debut in January 2022.",
      "The midfielder was touted for inclusion in Southgate's squad for this month's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium but Mainoo is set to figure for the Under-21s instead.",

Okay, only one is going for a league title as part of an assault of four trophies this season, but both are going through sizeable shake-ups as an organisation with a degree of uncertainty about what the future holds.",
      "Liverpool know they need a manager this summer to replace the one employee they were desperate not to lose. Manchester United know they might need a new manager this summer if Erik ten Hag cannot salvage something from this season.",
      "Both have lined up new sporting directors to come in and start work at the same time as the potential change in the dugout, with Richard Hughes set to move to Liverpool from Bournemouth and United still working on a deal that will see Dan Ashworth end his gardening leave from Newcastle and get to work.",
      "Those changes are being overseen by people newly placed in charge of overhauling the football structure at Old Trafford and Anfield. It is here where the contrast exists.",
      "After Ineos completed their investment into United it is Sir Dave Brailsford who is essentially overseeing the changes in the football department at United. The king of cycling's marginal gains has dipped his toe in the water in other sports, including elsewhere in Ineos' football empire, but this is a huge challenge for someone who has admitted he doesn't know an awful lot about the sport.",
      "“I will never be a domain expert in football. Never. And I am in cycling,\" Brailsford has said previously.",
      "\"If we watch a cycling race I’ll be watching in colour television, you’ll be watching in black and white, the same thing. What I’m seeing and you’re seeing would be different, I guarantee you.",
      "“But in football, I’m watching in black and white telly, and there are a lot of people watching in colour, and I’ll never get there. And I recognise that. But how am I gonna get better? There are areas in my role at the minute I can definitely improve and I’m gonna work on getting better.”",
      "While Brailsford is an outsider when it comes to football, Edwards is very much an insider. A former player who worked his way up through the ranks with jobs at Portsmouth and Liverpool, before landing at Liverpool as sporting director.",
      "Edwards left Anfield in May 2022 but has been tempted to return by the title of chief executive of football, a remit as wide as Brailsford's, who now sits on the United board and is a regular presence at Carrington. There are clear similarities in their role.",
      "Brailsford is also the high-profile figure. He is instantly recognisable and has rarely shirked the media. Whether that is through interviews or podcast appearances, he was visible as the leader of British Cycling and Team Sky and has almost become a kind of performance guru in recent years, offering leadership thoughts and deep thinking assessments in an industry that has become more open to such detailed talk.",
      "Edwards is a very different figure. Despite being the architect of Liverpool's Champions League and Premier League winning squad under Klopp, he kept a low profile and has done so since leaving the club. He doesn't do many interviews and if you asked neutral fans to pick him out of a line-up, they might struggle to do so. His breadth of work has done the talking for him.",
      "United were one of several clubs to try and tempt him back into the game, but he was never interested in another sporting director position. With Brailsford overseeing football, that was all he could get at Old Trafford.",
      "He initially rejected Liverpool's advances to bring him back, until they created a role for him, one that gives him the oversight of not just Liverpool, but the attempts of Fenway Sports Group to branch out into multi-club ownership.",
      "\"With Liverpool, I will oversee the required reinforcement of football operations, with a number of essential leadership positions needing urgent attention,\" Edwards said this week in the press release confirming his return.",

Brailsford and Edwards are the most powerful figures at both clubs and the brains behind the operation.

      "In football terms, a case can be made that Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool fit the mould. Two excellent teams with slightly differing approaches that make for watchable and enthralling games. But at Old Trafford this weekend there will be another contrast of styles, between a team happy to let opponents take shots at their goal and a team more than happy to do exactly that.",
      "Only Sheffield United have had more shots against them in the Premier League this season than Manchester United - and nobody needs reminding how that has panned out for the Blades, least of all Chris Wilder. Conversely, no team has tried their luck more often than Liverpool. They are capable of blowing teams away.",
      "We've already had one example of how these approaches can play out, back at Anfield in December. That Sunday afternoon saw Liverpool rack up 34 shots, but it ended goalless and Klopp was praising United's defending after the game.",
      "This weekend it is the first of two Old Trafford rematches, this one in an FA Cup quarter-final that must be settled on the day. It seems certain United will go in with the same approach and hope that a combination of blocks, saves and inaccuracy keeps their goal intact once again.",
      "That seems likely to be the plan, anyway. Erik ten Hag was quizzed on United offering up so many shots after last weekend's win against Everton when the Toffees had 23 attempts. So what? That was the summation of his answer. The Dutchman called them \"low quality\" chances but most revealingly said he had players more comfortable with defending in a low block.",
      "Ten Hag had abandoned any attempt to play a high line as injuries ripped his defence apart. It is likely to once again be Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans in unison on Sunday and the last thing they want is to be defending space in behind with the likes of Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah on the prowl.",
      "So instead, they will defend the penalty area. They will let the shots rain in and take the blows on their body, all the while knowing that their own team will carve out fewer opportunities, but hoping they are better quality chances and that they will be taken.",
      "Defensively it is a game plan that does rely on a little bit of good fortune. United have faced 198 shots in their last 10 games, including more than 20 in five of their last seven. By hook or by crook, they have won seven of those games.",
      "If they are to make it eight, then it seems pretty likely that Andre Onana will again be busy. He has played in nine of those 10 games and has made 39 saves in those matches. He has been in excellent form and it seems likely he will have to be again at Old Trafford.",
      "Then there are the centre-backs. With a low defensive line, it is essential Evans and Varane get blocks in. Evans made seven blocks in 156 minutes of football against Manchester City and Everton.",
      "It seems certain that Liverpool will be racking up the shots. Not only will United's defensive set-up let them do just that, but in Diaz, Salah and especially Nunez, they have players who are more than willing to try their luck.",
      "It means this FA Cup tie will be a contrast of styles. It might not make for a classic, but if United are to triumph then Onana, Varane and Evans might be key to how they do so.",

      "Man United are monitoring Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite ahead of this summer's transfer window.",
      "When Jarrad Branthwaite returned from his season-long loan spell at PSV Eindhoven last year, he probably didn't think he would be generating interest from Manchester United and being linked with Real Madrid the following season.",
      "The Everton centre-back has enjoyed a sharp rise this season, establishing himself as one of the best young defenders in the Premier League. The Manchester Evening News understands United are monitoring him ahead of the summer transfer window amid plans to strengthen their defensive options.",
      "A lot of uncertainty currently surrounds the centre-back department in M16, with only Lisandro Martinez, in the eyes of many, guaranteed a place in the club's long-term plans. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are both out of contract this summer and it is possible that Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof could both be sold.",
      "Should Varane's contract not be renewed, United will almost certainly have to target the addition of a star-studded right-sided centre-back. They have been linked with a cluster of names in addition to Branthwaite, such as Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo and more recently Jules Kounde of Barcelona.",
      "Unlike Todibo and Kounde, Branthwaite is left-footed, meaning United's pursuit of him could prompt questions about their decision to chase a left-footed centre-back when Martinez is already their left-sided central defender-in-chief. The Argentinian is key to United's style of play, helping them progress the ball from deep, meaning he is assured of keeping his spot in Erik ten Hag's first-choice starting line-up when fit.",
      "Branthwaite, however, is capable of playing on the right side of a centre-back partnership, though he has played on the left alongside James Tarkowski for Everton this term. The 21-year-old, who joined the Toffees from Carlisle United in 2020, suggested earlier this season he would be comfortable playing on the right, such is the quality of his weaker foot.",
      "He told Everton's club website: \"I am left-footed, but I've got a five-star weak foot on the new FIFA! If I'm hitting a long pass, I'll go with my left; short passes with my right.\"",
      "Branthwaite's ability to progress the ball, though Everton are not a heavy possession-based team, has shone through at certain junctures this season, just as it did during his time on loan at PSV in 2022/23.",
      "During his stint at the Dutch giants, Branthwaite's development was overseen by former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was head coach for almost all of last season. The Dutchman described him as a 'two-footed' player, suggesting he could operate either on the right or the left.",
      "Van Nistelrooy said: \"He is a great talent. The boy is young, but he has a future.",
      "\"He is good on the ball, can play on the left or the right of centre-back because he is two-footed. He has height and speed, so he is very complete.\"",
      "Though Branthwaite has enjoyed a stellar season up to this point, it is important to remain mindful that he does not turn 22 until late June, meaning he is still in development. At the same time, United, should they be hell-bent on signing him, would be securing a player with room for growth and one that can be sold for an even higher fee in years to come.",
      "In a world where versatility and ball-playing credentials are key in any centre-back's game, Branthwaite ticks several boxes, especially when Ten Hag is so keen on his defenders being expert ball-players.",

      "The EFL have issued a statement after Premier League clubs rejected the government's offer of a financial package to help the football pyramid",
      "The English Football League (EFL) has asked for a football regulator to be introduced after Premier League clubs rejected a deal to increase payments down the pyramid.",
      "The EFL expressed their disappointment at the 'repeated failures' by Premier League clubs in light of this week's no-deal. Two years ago, the government told Premier League teams to give more money to help keep football going at all levels.",
      "After the decision on Monday, the EFL said they were upset and call on the government to bring in an independent regulator. The Daily Mail claims that Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham, Aston Villa, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and AFC Bournemouth were the teams to object.",
      "The EFL issued a response in a strong statement, they said: \"The EFL Board met today and considered its position in respect of recent discussions by Premier League Clubs and is clearly disappointed at their repeated failure to put forward any new funding offer for EFL Clubs that would have significant benefits for the entire football pyramid.",
      "\"Over the last two years, following the recommendations of the Fan Led Review, the League and its Clubs have been pushing for a new funding offer from the Premier League and remain ready and waiting to consider and conclude a new arrangement.\"",
      "\"Whilst it has been expected on a number of occasions, the lack of positive progress once again demonstrates how difficult an issue this is for football to address, without independent input.",
      "\"Despite pressure from government, fans and united voices across the professional game, the latest development represents a further setback, and the League now awaits a formal update from the Premier League as to how it proposes to re-engage on its latest commitment to deliver \"a sustainably funded financial agreement with the EFL.",
      "\"The EFL has repeatedly said that financial redistribution coupled with enhanced cost controls are needed to help achieve its over-riding objective of making EFL Clubs financially sustainable and competitive, so that they can continue to serve their supporters and communities long into the future, no matter what level of the pyramid they play in.",
      "\"The league eagerly anticipates the introduction of the Football Governance Bill given it is now more important than ever that the Independent Regulator is provided necessary powers to secure the long-term sustainability of the pyramid.",
      "\"We look forward to continuing further engagement with Government and MPs and Peers from all parties. In particular, it is really important that work commences on the much-needed State of the Game Review at the earliest possible opportunity as this will provide the objective basis for a sustainable football model.\"",
      "Recent events have shed light on the financial trouble faced by clubs across various leagues. Bury FC and Macclesfield Town had to dissolve due to financial crises, while other teams, such as Southend United, Scunthorpe United, Bolton Wanderers, and Reading FC, have had close brushes with administration.",

      "The creator and scorer of Manchester United's first goal against Liverpool under Erik ten Hag are both long gone. Anthony Elanga was sold and Jadon Sancho exiled and then loaned.",
      "Marcus Rashford slotted in the winner on that balmy and uproarious evening in August 2022. It was the night of Ten Hag's first win as United manager and Liverpool's first domestic defeat that calendar year.",
      "Ten Hag said on live television afterwards: \"They (the players) can play f-----g football.\". Away from the cameras, he used the same expletive: \"F-----g hell.\" He used the same words nine days earlier when he was reeling from United's generational nadir at Brentford. The words now had a different meaning.",
      "United players were hauled in for training the day after the Brentford debacle and Ten Hag joined them on a punishing 13.8 kilometre run in 30-degree heat. An eyewitness said the players were \"ruined\".",
      "He then decisively settled on four changes to the team: Raphael Varane, Tyrell Malacia, Scott McTominay and Anthony Elanga in for Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Fred and Cristiano Ronaldo. The demotions of captain Maguire and talisman Ronaldo were especially significant. It marked the beginning of the end for Ronaldo at United and Maguire was stripped of the captaincy 11 months later.",
      "Sancho's goal elicited a roar unlike any other this correspondent has heard at Old Trafford. The online footage does not do it justice. One of the United analysts celebrated so wildly he punched a desk and sent a colleague's coffee cup flying.",
      "Casemiro was unveiled on the pitch that night and the £70million signing was an afterthought post-match. United fans taunted Jordan Henderson with a chorus of \"You're just a s--t Casemiro\".",
      "That defeat signalled the start of Liverpool's malaise last season. They return to Old Trafford on Sunday with their aura restored. One cup already sits atop a plinth in the Anfield museum and three more may be required as Jurgen Klopp continues his farewell tour.",
      "Scuppering a City treble, and safeguarding United's 1999 vintage, was an incentive for supporters at last year's FA Cup final. Kiboshing a Klopp quadruple is another in the first cup quarter-final between United and Liverpool.",
      "Ten Hag will not frame it that way. Returning to Wembley with a victory against United's nemesis would do wonders for his approval ratings. A successful season would still be possible with progress to the semi-finals.",
      "The brief exposure Ten Hag granted Toby Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye and Dermot Mee is set to end as United should have a fuller squad again. Maguire, Mason Mount and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are back in training. Rasmus Hojlund could be before kick-off, too. United will still have 50 hours to assess Hojlund after Ten Hag's 1.15pm press conference ends today, should there still be a doubt over the Dane's fitness.",
      "With Hojlund, United are only two players short of their strongest XI. As much as some pseuds try to complicate football, it is an uncomplicated game. With their striker scoring, United embarked on a five-game winning streak, racking up 15 goals.",
      "Without Hojlund, they have lost two of their past four games and scraped five goals. A defender and a defensive midfielder have scored, Rashford hit the goal of his life at City and there were two penalty conversions against Everton.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, colossal in his breakthrough performance against Liverpool 19 months ago, is a loss. As are Luke Shaw and Jonny Evans, both disciplined in the goalless draw at Anfield in December.",
      "As staid as United were against Everton, the early kick-off time and anodyne opponents had a bearing on the performance. Liverpool at home in the FA Cup quarter-final is not a mere fixture or cup tie but an occasion. The United players have to rise to it.",
      "They did for 70-odd minutes at City the other week. United were compact and diligent against \"the best team in the world\", in the words of Ten Hag. After reticence against City United have to be relentless against Liverpool.",
      "Lose and United will have regressed to two years ago. Ejection from the Champions League by Atletico Madrid was the death knell for their campaign even though they were only three points off fourth place.",
      "The mood was corrosive at the time. A fan turned on technical director Darren Fletcher during United's listless home draw with Everton at the start of April and the month was marred by defeats on the blue and red sides of Stanley Park, as well as at Arsenal.",
      "United's sole win that month against Norwich was overshadowed by protests outside Old Trafford. Inside, Paul Pogba's final appearance at the stadium was soundtracked to 'F--k off Pogba' from the boisterous section of the Stretford End. A Ronaldo hat-trick did not take top billing.",
      "The day after the Atletico loss, this newspaper reported Ten Hag was United's preferred candidate to replace Ralf Rangnick. The March internationals are an ideal time for forward planning and the Ineos power brokers are assessing potential replacements for Ten Hag.",
      "A second United Dutch manager could feasibly finish outside the Premier League top four, lift the FA Cup and leave the club premises. Louis van Gaal barely celebrated United's last FA Cup in 2016 as it belatedly dawned on him he was about to be replaced. Van Gaal's departure was announced just over 48 hours after he paraded the cup in front of journalists in the Wembley press conference room.",
      "There is not an obvious successor waiting to ascend the throne as there was back then. Lose to Liverpool and the red-top headlines have an easy headline: 'Erik ten games' - in the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham and Aston Villa both play this weekend. If Spurs beat Fulham and Villa prevail at West Ham, United will be nine points adrift of fifth, a demeaning but potential route back into the Champions League. Sancho is likelier to be playing in it next season.",

PSG, however, never submitted an official offer for the England international. There was suspicion the rendezvous with PSG was a negotiating tactic to put pressure on United to offer Rashford a new contract, which he earned in July last year, keeping him at the club until 2028.",
      "Rashford was worthy of earning a new long-term deal last summer after plundering 30 goals. It was the first time he had reached such landmark in his career and he became the first United player since Robin van Persie a decade earlier to reach such an illustrious figure.",
      "This season, Rashford is running out of time to reach double figures. His penalty in last weekend's 2-0 win over Everton marked just his seventh goal of the campaign in all competitions.",
      "Like so many of his teammates, the 26-year-old has failed to perform at the peak of his powers this season, getting nowhere remotely close to the levels he hit last term. Erik ten Hag, somewhat ambitiously, said at the end of last season he felt Rashford was capable of scoring 40 goals a season.",
      "There is no doubt Rashford is an outstanding talent. His goal in the derby against Manchester City earlier this month was a reminder of his capabilities.",
      "That is why it is hard to make a firm judgement on whether or not United should cash-in this summer in the event of PSG knocking on their door with a lucrative offer. His contract situation means the Reds will be within their rights, as they should, to demand a big-money fee if PSG select him as their top target to replace Mbappe.",
      "However, as much as a big-money cash injection could be useful for United in the event of them missing out on Champions League qualification for next season, Rashford is still a player who has the capabilities to flourish at Old Trafford and continue with his quest to leave a lasting legacy at his boyhood club. Last season demonstrated what he is capable of producing.",
      "As United prepare to embark on a new era under Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, Rashford should be thinking he can cement himself as one of the players the club can be rebuilt around. He is United through and through and, just like Ratcliffe, will want the very best for the club to enable it to move forward.",
      "At the same time, he is one of the most valuable players in the squad that will command a fee capable of assisting with balancing the books in relation to Financial Fair Play [FFP]. United need to cut their cloth this summer and outgoings are set to be more forthcoming than in previous years.",
      "Looking at Rashford's situation and his role at United in isolation, there is no right or wrong answer. There are huge benefits in keeping him, but there are also arguments to suggest a high profile sale has its pluses, provided United are presented with a good price.",
      "Rashford is better than both Jadon Sancho and Antony, who cost United north of £70m and £80m each respectively, meaning United could demand £100m plus. It could be a hard call to make and only time will tell what the best decision is.",

      "A Manchester City executive has welcomed Sir Jim Ratcliffe's plans to turn Old Trafford into a 'Wembley of the North' - but he hopes that United will learn lessons from their rivals. Marty Edelman, who is a member of the City Football Group board, told an audience at the MIPIM property conference in the French Riviera on Tuesday (March 12) that the move by Manchester United is 'excellent'.",
      "It comes after the club's co-owner Sir Jim announced his ambitions to replace Old Trafford with a ground that could be used as a national venue and redevelop the area around the stadium. The club has set up a new task force to explore the options available.",
      "Speaking at MIPIM, Mr Edelman reflected on Man City's success in regenerating parts of the city, most notably Ancoats. He said the club teaming up with Manchester council to redevelop the 'rundown' area was, in part, motivated by the social impact it would have.",
      "He also made an 'admission' to the audience, saying that when the club was first taken over, its bosses looked up to its rivals at Man United as role models. Asked about United's plans to redevelop Old Trafford, Mr Edelman said: \"We think it's great. Why wouldn't we?\"",
      "But he went on to say United should now learn from City. He said: \"The value of the rivalry is important to both clubs actually and it's important to Manchester. We'd rather be the one who wins all the time, but other than that, it's not good for any of the clubs to fail.",
      "\"And I think the description of Old Trafford by its owners is accurate. So I think the fact that the new lead owner is going to make a dramatic move is excellent. I think it's going to balance out the city and I hope, just as we tried to emulate them on the pitch, I hope they do some of the things we've done for the city and with the city because it's going to make it a better place for everybody.\"",
      "Earllier in the event, Mr Edelman said that the club is 'full of ideas' for its next steps that will follow the extension of the Etihad Stadium's North Stand. The plans include a new hotel, office space and a 'fan experience' offering food, drink and entertainment.",
      "He also spoke of the new Co-Op Live arena opening nearby. He said the club is now considering creating an 'apprentice school'.",
      "He said: \"We have a destination. We know the destination can provide entertainment. And now can we also have it provide an educational opportunity, particularly in East Manchester where we can give people part-time jobs and they can also learn.\"",

      "Ignoring for a while the fact that in capacity terms, Old Trafford is already that stadium, it's just been neglected by the owners that Ratcliffe has now cosied up with, there is also the debate over whether it is really accurate.",
      "When Everton move into their new Bramley Moore home and when Manchester City's Etihad redevelopment is completed for the start of the 2025/26 season, Manchester and Liverpool will have four football stadiums with a capacity of more than 50,000 and three with a capacity of more than 60,000. Does it need public funding to build another? That is a question that doesn't need answering.",
      "Part of Ratcliffe's pitch is to give the north a stadium that can host a Champions League final or an FA Cup final. But Old Trafford hosted an England international last year and the FA Cup is never leaving Wembley.",
      "As for a Champions League final, the Etihad will be able to offer UEFA what they want before United when it comes to bringing the showpiece game back to Manchester after Old Trafford hosted the penalty shootout success for Juventus back in 2003.",
      "UEFA demands at least a 60,000-capacity stadium for a Champions League final and when City's North Stand redevelopment is complete, it will come in at more than 61,000. It will also be able to offer an on-site hotel and a sizeable fan zone, as well as outstanding transport links to the city centre.",
      "Since 2009 there have been finals held at stadiums offering an attendance of between 60,976 and 65,842 on six occasions - in Rome, Munich, Lisbon, Cardiff, Kyiv and Madrid. The Etihad would fit the bill.",
      "Perhaps the biggest thorn would be City's relations with UEFA, although that is a separate issue. The Etihad would be big enough, modern enough and with enough facilities on-site to host European finals, England games, even FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "There is no doubt United's home ground needs some major investment. That point was made forcefully by City fans when they won 3-0 there in October, with a chant that began with \"Old Trafford is falling down\" now plagiarised by visiting supporters on an almost weekly basis at Old Trafford.",
      "But it's not the case that it can be a flagship stadium for the north. The area already has some outstanding stadiums that are capable of hosting big events. Ratcliffe can glance across town to see that is the case.",

      "For many years now, match-going supporters have criticised the experience of attending fixtures at Old Trafford with the stadium looking like a shadow of its former glory. The standard of the stadium is so low that the FA overlooked it for their UEFA Euro 2028 stadium venue list for the UK and Ireland tournament.",
      "Instead, Manchester City's Etihad Stadium and Everton's Bramley-Moore Dock have been chosen in the North West. Upon Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival at United, he committed to improving Old Trafford and it was announced this month that the plan is to build a brand-new ground in the vicinity of the current Old Trafford.",
      "Reflecting on this news, Neville took aim at the current owners and concentrated on what Ratcliffe and himself, who has been appointed in an advisory role for the project, must do next. Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, brought to you by Sky Bet, he said: \"I think the Glazers have been negligent in the past 10 years in not appointing the right people.",
      "\"We think Sir Jim Ratcliffe coming in is amazing because he’s appointed sporting director and a CEO – it’s unbelievable really, it’s just like normal practice. My biggest thing is the stadium and regeneration.",

Manchester City have invested in the Co-Op Arena that’s going to open in a month or two, they own half of that. They’ve invested in other things that have made money around the ground and invested in the place.",

      "Dan Ashworth has plenty of time to finetune his plans for Manchester United as he wiles away his hours in the garden, waiting for the club that wants him as their new sporting director to agree a deal that will take him away from Newcastle.",
      "The two clubs continue to try and reach an agreement that will see Ashworth take control of the Ineos project at Old Trafford sooner rather than later, but Newcastle's demand for upwards of £15million has been laughed off publicly and privately in Manchester. While a stalemate ensues, Ashworth remains on gardening leave, catching up on Netflix perhaps, or more likely dreaming up the ideas that he believes will take this club back to the top.",
      "You can see why running the football operations at Manchester United would appeal. It doesn't quite feel right to describe United as a sleeping giant, but this is a behemoth of a football club that is significantly underperforming, based on reputation, history, investment and potential. The rewards for those who finally get it right will be golden.",
      "Ashworth will head up a much more detailed football structure that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford are putting in place, with the 53-year-old then reporting to new chief executive Omar Berrada, who will start in the summer when his period of gardening leave ends.",
      "Having held similar roles with West Brom, Brighton and Newcastle, as well as being the technical director at the Football Association, Ashworth's methods aren't entirely a mystery, even if some of his philosophies will have to change when he is in charge of a club of this size. One area he is always keen to focus on is a club's academy and at United it is a rich source of potential.",
      "Erik ten Hag has promoted Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho to the first team and others have got their chance this season thanks to an injury crisis. But United still carry a bloated squad and there could be an exodus this summer, with as many as a dozen senior players potentially departing.",
      "Don't expect all of them to be replaced. For starters, they don't need to be replaced, while Ashworth's view, as laid out in a fascinating interview with the Training Ground Guru in December 2020, when he was at Brighton, is that Premier League clubs should look to youth more and avoid the temptation of using the financial resources they have compared to other European leagues.",
      "\"Of all my roles, the one I’m most passionate about is opening up pathways for young players. Sometimes I've seen clubs work in silos and the academy is working all hours god sends to try and develop players for the first team and the recruitment department is working all hours god sends to try and sign players,\" Ashworth said.",
      "\"In that scenario the recruitment department might be busy looking at a right-back from overseas when there's one right under their noses in the Academy.",
      "\"From a Premier League point of view - and I have been guilty of this - because you have so much money in relation to the majority of the other leagues in the world you can compete for most players in the world. That applies to Brighton too, even though we’re not a top six club.",
      "\"When you are trying to put together a squad that can survive and thrive in the Premier League, the temptation is to go with proven players that are able to come in and are ‘here and now ready.'\"",
      "United's academy will be confident of being able to supply players who can fill gaps in the squad. Willy Kambwala has had first-team experience this season and might be able to fill the role of fourth or fifth-choice centre-back next season, for example.",
      "Finding gems from the academy is even more valuable in an era of strict financial controls. United are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules at the moment, so promoting from within after a sale might be an area they can benefit from this summer.",
      "Ashworth won't be directly in charge of recruitment, but he will overseeing football operations at the club, which essentially means everyone will be reporting into him. He can set the tone for a club that should be focusing on signing star players and then bolstering the squad with the pipeline of talent that Manchester United has always produced.",

      "He made no suggestion that an imminent return to management was on the cards, however bookmakers have now surprisingly thrown Solskjaer into the hat to take over on Wearside. According to gambling.com, the 51-year-old arrives at a solid 5/2 third favourite for the Black Cats job, aligned with a 28.6 percent probability of this becoming a reality.",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag could be forced into a really difficult selection decision in the FA Cup against Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "For all of Manchester United's injury problems this season, Diogo Dalot has been an almost ever-present figure for manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Portuguese international has featured in all but two of United's 39 matches in all competitions so far this season, only failing to make the matchday squad once. That was as a result of a red card he received in the dying stages of December's goalless draw with Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "With the exception of the 2-0 defeat to West Ham United that followed the aforementioned stalemate with Liverpool, Dalot's name has always been visible on the teamsheet, either as a starter or as a substitute. Even when he has been named on the bench, he has only failed to step off it once - the opening weekend win over Wolves at Old Trafford in August.",
      "Dalot was beaten to the right-back spot against the Black Country outfit after Aaron Wan-Bissaka won the battle between the duo in pre-season. The duo fought tirelessly in the second half of last season and during pre-season to become Ten Hag's first-choice right-back.",
      "After Wan-Bissaka got the nod at the start of the season, Dalot soon reclaimed top spot in the pecking order. The former AC Milan loanee has, perhaps subtly, has been one of United's best players this season, often proving reliable and consistent without generating too much attention outside of those who do not watch the Reds religiously.",
      "Since January, a juncture which marked an admission to the treatment room for Wan-Bissaka, Dalot has made the right-back spot his own, producing a series of consistent performances that have been worthy of sevens or eights of ten. As a result, he has made the right-back spot his own, meaning United, when it comes to settling on future plans, may offload Wan-Bissaka to accommodate the addition of a new right-back.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has missed each of United's last nine matches, meaning Dalot has had a free run at right-back. He has not failed to disappoint, churning out consistent, solid performances. As per FotMob, Dalot's ratings have been consistent, earning a player rating north of seven in five of his last seven games, including a score of 8.3 in the 2-1 win at Aston Villa last month, where he provided the assist for Scott McTominay's late winner.",
      "His consistency at right-back, however, could be derailed against Liverpool this weekend. Wan-Bissaka is in contention to feature in the FA Cup quarter-final clash, meaning could be recalled to the starting line-up, forcing Dalot to switch to left-back.",
      "As a result of Luke Shaw's and Tyrell Malacia's ongoing absences, United are currently without a senior left-back, meaning Victor Lindelof and Sofyan Amrabat have deputised in recent weeks. Had Wan-Bissaka been fit, Dalot would have almost certainly picked up the baton from Shaw.",
      "Now that Wan-Bissaka is poised to make his comeback, it is very much possible that Dalot will fill the vacancy that Shaw has vacated. The Portuguese ace has played at left-back several times under Ten Hag, often carrying out the duty with minimal fuss. As per Transfermarkt, he has played on the left of the back-four eight times already this season.",
      "Despite not being left-footed, Dalot can provide more balance at left-back than Lindelof has, such is the way he is more equipped to make forward runs and support the attacking play. He has also scored from the left-back berth this season, albeit against League One side Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup.",
      "Dalot has previously admitted he is only too happy to play at left-back, meaning he is unlikely to kick up a fuss if Ten Hag requires him to switch flanks this weekend. He has earned the right to be trusted by Ten Hag after a string of impressive performances under his watch.",
      "Alternatively, Wan-Bissaka could also play at left-back, though that feels a lot less likely. The former Crystal Palace man started on the left in his last appearance, which was the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in January, and that was his very first time in that position in United colours.",
      "Given the calibre of the opposition United are up against this weekend, and Dalot's experience at left-back, he is far more likely to get the nod, provided Wan-Bissaka is fit enough to start at right-back. Should that come to fruition, United's back-four could have the most balanced look to it has had since Shaw was reassigned to the treatment room.",

      "He has, of course, already made several steps towards a change in structure. Omar Berrada’s forthcoming arrival as CEO from Manchester City showed an initial statement of intent while his plans for a revamped Old Trafford proves he is thinking about the long-term as well as the near future.",
      "Despite becoming the second-wealthiest owner in the English pyramid upon his minority stake purchase - only behind the Saudi Public Investment Fund of Newcastle - he too is beholden to Premier League spending rules.",
      "Financial Fair Play is no stranger to Ratcliffe, having had to balance the books at OGC Nice since his 2019 acquisition. He will have a higher threshold to play with at United given the revenues the club generates but the possibility of missing out on Champions League football next season will still stir worry within.",
      "Qualification is obviously not something he can directly control for the remainder of this season, with an Erik ten Hag dismissal very unlikely before then. However, Ratcliffe and INEOS will start to be scrutinised more closely this summer, by which time three decisions will have had to be made.",
      "The first of which is brokering a deal for Newcastle sporting director Dan Ashworth. United are adamant that they will not pay the £20 million compensation fee demanded by the Magpies, who paid Brighton less than £4m for him two years ago.",
      "Ashworth is currently on gardening leave after telling the club of his wish to exit and Ratcliffe says Newcastle would be “silly” to prolong the inevitable. That said, the 71-year-old will know his arrival will not be cost-free.",
      "Ratcliffe is unwilling to fork out £20m, despite him knowing that the former FA chief is perhaps worth 10-times as much in the long-run, due to short-term considerations and what impact any compensation fee would have on FFP thresholds.",
      "Sacking compensation counts towards spending costs and the amount paid out to Ashworth would be deducted from the summer transfer spending allowance. The same issue occurs if Ten Hag is sacked.",
      "Ratcliffe has remained ominously tight-lipped about his assessment of Ten Hag, which could mean many things but definitely signals that his job is not secure. MEN Sport understands that Ratcliffe is indeed not totally sold on the Dutchman, despite last season’s success.",
      "Any estimation on how much compensation United would shell out upon a dismissal would be merely speculative but it would absolutely eat into the summer budget. A lack of Champions League football and a squashed wallet does not spell out a marquee summer for Ratcliffe.",
      "The INEOS chief is expected to show a number of players the door this summer, maybe stretching into double figures, perhaps fulfilling the ‘open-heart surgery’ prophecy given by Ralf Rangnick in 2022.",
      "However, this potential mass exodus of players is not all down to Ratcliffe. He will naturally have precedence over those whose contracts are running out, such as Anthony Martial and Raphael Varane, but when it comes to sales, that depends on how much clubs are willing to pay.",
      "United have been woeful at getting returns or low-loss fees for their players for at least a decade. Donny van de Beek at Frankfurt and Hannibal Mejbri at Sevilla have combined buy-out clauses of £29m in their loan agreements.",
      "The problem is, both are enduring underwhelming spells to say the least and neither is likely to be taken in permanently. Jadon Sancho - with no purchase option in his loan - would look more likely to stay at Borussia Dortmund if the club had not already said they cannot afford him.",

Time is very much of the essence now with the saga being drawn out longer than many would've hoped for at the Theatre of Dreams. Liverpool have already moved to welcome Michael Edwards back to Anfield in a senior role within the Fenway Sports Group ownership.",

      "Erik ten Hag has incorporated numerous exciting young players from the Man United academy into first-team training recently",
      "Bendito Mantato will be looking to impress Erik ten Hag in training ahead of Manchester United's clash against Everton this weekend. The 16-year-old winger has been the latest player to join first-team training at Carrington as the Reds Devils continue to nurse an injury crisis.",
      "Manchester United will welcome the Toffees to Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and, with several attackers ruled out, Mantato will be hoping to earn himself a place in the matchday squad. Ten Hag hasn't been afraid to hand out opportunities to the next generation this season, giving three academy prospects their senior debuts.",
      "Daniel Gore was handed his first-team debut on his 19th birthday, featuring off the bench against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup third round. Willy Kambwala followed suit a couple of months later, appearing in Manchester United's clash with West Ham in the Premier League.",

      "Then, after Anthony Martial suffered a groin injury, Omari Forson was given the nod, and he's since become a regular feature off the bench for Ten Hag. Mantato, who's widely regarded as one of the club's hottest prospects, could be next in line if he can impress the Dutchman in training.",
      "He was also joined by Harry Amass (16), Ethan Williams (18), Ethan Wheatley (18), Louie Jackson (18) and Habeeb Ogunneye (18). So, with that being said, the Manchester Evening News has taken a look at Mantato and why he's the latest youngster to catch Ten Hag's eye.",
      "Mantato joined the club aged nine and he recently made his debut for the England Under-16s. The winger has made seven appearances for the Manchester United Under-18s this season, scoring one goal and providing two assists, after making his debut in 2022 at the age of just 14.",
      "Rising Ballers, who pride themselves as 'the voice of the next wave' and showcase some of the most exciting young players from across the world on social media, have been closely following Mantato for a while. In November 2023, they acknowledged the teenager's incredible progress at Old Trafford after a clip of a goal he scored went viral.",
      "Mantato earned himself a comparison to Bukayo Saka – a right winger, who is also left-footed and first began his career as a defender before venturing further upfield.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands that Mantato has attracted interest from a handful of top Premier League clubs. The Red Devils are hopeful the teenager will commit his long-term future at Old Trafford when he turns 17 next year, but he's currently considering his options.",
      "In the event that Manchester United fail to secure Mantato's signature, it's understood the club would receive a six-figure sum in compensation if he were to switch clubs.",

      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner hopes the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe will be a \"springboard\" for the club's success but says he hasn't yet had the chance to meet the INEOS chief.",
      "Ratcliffe's purchase of a 27.7 per cent stake in United was officially completed last month and he has since outlined his ambitions to restore the Reds to their former glory. Speaking to the media last week, the 71-year-old did not go into any great detail about his plans for the women's team, but admitted, “if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.”",
      "It is a sentiment that was echoed by Skinner in his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, with the United boss fully aware the next few months will be hugely decisive in deciding his own future at the club. “We (he and Ratcliffe) have not managed to meet yet, I know it’s on the horizon very soon,” he said ahead of this weekend's trip to West Ham United.",
      "“But we have our constant kind of feed through our bosses anyway in terms of kind of how we want to go forwards, what’s going to work and there’s a lot to do. I see it as a real positive move. I think if you know me as a character, my energy is full in, I’m all in, so with my energy, coupled with the fantastic movement of the INEOS investment, I think it’s a real positive moment.",
      "“We have to capitalise on that, we’re going to try to do that, we’re going to put all our behaviours in place for that. It’s hopefully a springboard for everybody to find the success that everybody wants for Man United.”",
      "Ratcliffe first met Erik ten Hag nearly a year ago, while the pair were pictured together at Carrington in January following the completion of the Ineos chief's investment. Sir Dave Brailsford, Ineos sporting director, is currently conducting an extensive audit of all levels at the club and has stepped away from his work with the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team to concentrate on this task.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first orders of business as part-owner is to decide the best course of action for Old Trafford, with the fanbase currently divided on whether the iconic venue should be renovated or replaced with a brand new stadium. The INEOS boss suggested last week that, should the men's team relocate, Old Trafford could be used to house both the women's and academy teams, who currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village.",
      "But Skinner admitted such a move is unlikely to happen in the near future. “I’m sure that’s a little bit away,” he said. “We love playing at Leigh Sports Village, it’s become a fortress but obviously it’s a special occasion when you play at Old Trafford.",

That’s our aim. If it comes down the line and that’s what happens, then I’m sure there will be some fantastic games at the stadium.”",
      "Skinner, who joined the Reds from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer and has been under scrutiny this term following a string of disappointing results. United, who finished second in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and reached the FA Cup final, are currently in fourth place, seven points off a European spot.",

      "As the final whistle blew at an overcast Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon, Erik ten Hag cut the figure of a man well-acquainted with the potential repercussions of Manchester United’s 10th Premier League defeat of the season.",
      "Head down, hands in pockets, the Dutchman headed for the tunnel, stopping briefly to offer a customary, consolatory round of applause for the supporters that remained inside the stadium. He wore an air of dejection that mirrored the despondency his counterpart, Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner, had exuded during his own commiseratory lap around the pitch at the Emirates Stadium just seven days prior.",
      "In north London, Skinner's side had been thoroughly beaten by title-chasing Arsenal in the Women's Super League (WSL), their hopes of European qualification this term left hanging precariously in the balance. \"I'm here to try and win for Manchester United and to continue to grow the team that's needed to win for Manchester United and I think that's really important,\" Skinner insisted after the game. It was a defiant, determined sentiment not too dissimilar to the one evoked by Ten Hag after Saturday's defeat to Fulham.",
      "\"When we get the injuries back we will be more in balance in the team,\" the Dutchman said. \"We also need to strengthen the squad in the transfer windows and then there are many good players, with high potential coming up. Definitely we are going in the right direction. So when everyone is available we have a very good team.\"",
      "In their respective post-match assessments, both Skinner and Ten Hag seemed to allude to a Manchester United of the future, to two projects still in their infancy and two teams that require patience and time to ensure their potential is fully realised. But, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe now officially installed as the club’s part-owner, time does not appear to be the friend of either manager.",
      "Speaking to the media last week, Ratcliffe remained non-committal on Ten Hag’s future, telling reporters: “I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that.” It was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the Dutchman who, despite insisting he “doesn’t care” about the growing noise surrounding his United future, will be fully aware of the significance of the coming months and how they might shape the trajectory of his Old Trafford career.",
      "While Ten Hag was also keen to highlight he remains under contract at the club until 2025, Skinner does not have that same luxury. The 40-year-old, who joined United from National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) side Orlando Pride in 2021, is out of contract this summer.",
      "And though it is understood he is not in immediate danger of losing his job, it is clear the women’s team, too, is at a crossroads as Ratcliffe and co. seek to restore United to a footballing superpower. The INEOS chief did not go into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during his hour-long discussion with the press last week, but it is clear he harbours ambitions of the Reds one day earning a seat at Europe’s top table.",
      "March's edition of Women's Football News is packed full of exclusive interviews, features and comment on all the big talking points from the WSL and beyond... and you can order your copy HERE",
      "“The only thing I would say,” he told those in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, “is that if it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful.” It’s worth noting there has already been confirmation of one prominent departure on the Women’s side of operations, with head of Women’s football Polly Bancroft set to take up a position as a chief executive of League Two side Grimsby Town at the end of the current season.",
      "Bancroft was brought in from Brighton & Hove Albion, where she worked as general manager, in October 2022. In her newly-created role at United, Bancroft was tasked with implementing a cohesive strategy for the Women’s first team and academy, overseeing both day-to-day operations and long-term performance.",
      "But, though there have been some successes - chiefly her facilitating of a move to a new state-of-the-art training facility at Carrington - the past 16 months have not always been easy for Bancroft. She was, of course, charged with helping tie down first team stars Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle to new contracts last term.",
      "And, while she was by no means the only figure involved in the handling of those negotiations, the fact Russo and Batlle both left the club last summer - for Arsenal and Barcelona respectively - was viewed in some quarters as a damning indictment of her abilities. Certainly, United will be aware they run the risk of losing yet another of their big names on a free transfer this summer, with goalkeeper Mary Earps also out of contract in June.",
      "The England shot-stopper - who has been voted best goalkeeper in the world for two consecutive years - was the subject of a world-record bid from Arsenal last summer. As they did when the Gunners came calling for Russo in January 2023, United refused to sanction Earps’ exit, though there is every chance she joins her Lionesses teammate in north London in a few months' time, with Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona also being touted as other possible destinations for the 30-year-old.",
      "Then there are other behind-the-scenes matters to address, with United Women still in the market for a permanent head physio after the former incumbent Ibrahim Kerem moved over to Ten Hag’s side in November. There is also a growing sense the departure of Martin Ho, Skinner’s assistant, last summer has had a detrimental effect on the Women’s team's recent form.",
      "Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann Kvinner on a two-year deal in July, guiding them to the group stages of the Women’s Champions League and thus making them the first Norwegian outfit in history to achieve that particular feat. And while there is an element of uncertainty about the futures of a number of key United personnel, recent discourse over the future of Old Trafford has also raised questions about the long-term home of the Women’s team.",
      "Skinner’s side currently play at rugby league ground Leigh Sports Village though, with Ratcliffe stating a preference to build a new industry-leading stadium for the men’s team, there seems to be scope for United Women to one day relocate to the club’s spiritual home. “If you use that as a centre of regeneration, a bit like the Olympic Village, then I think what you probably finish up doing is Old Trafford would finish up being reduced in size - in the same footprint but a smaller facility - which can be used for all sorts of community things, be it a concert or whatever,\" Ratcliffe said last week.",
      "\"The ladies teams could play there. The academy teams could play there. Some of the local teams could play there and Old Trafford could sort of become a community asset and then you'd have this world-class stadium next door to it.”",
      "With the 71-year-old's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in United having only been officially ratified by the Premier League and the FA earlier this month, it is clear that only time will bring clarity on several of the club’s myriad unresolved issues. However, with Skinner’s side having so far fallen short in their quest for domestic and European success this term, it is imperative the Women’s team is not left behind as United seek to emerge into Ratcliffe's brave new world.",

      "Man Utd have confirmed that Polly Bancroft will step down as the club's head of women's football at the end of the campaign.",
      "Manchester United have announced that Polly Bancroft - the club's head of women's football - will step down from her role at the end of the season.",
      "Bancroft, who has worked at Old Trafford since October 2022, will leave the club to become Grimsby Town's new chief executive. She has played a starring role in overseeing the development of United's women's team and helping them become a strong force in the women's game.",
      "Her highlights include United Women reaching their first-ever FA Cup final last season and achieving a second-place finish in the Women's Super League [WSL]. The club also clinched UEFA Women's Champions League qualification for the very first time during her tenure.",
      "As well as providing support to head coach Marc Skinner, she also played a key role in significant improvements in infrastructure for the women's team, featuring a new training facility at Carrington. The popularity of the women's game in England has been on a sharp rise since the Lionesses' European Championship success in the summer of 2022.",
      "United Women, as recently as last weekend, played in front of a record-breaking WSL crowd at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal, with 60,160 people in attendance. United, however, were beaten 3-1 by the Gunners.",
      "Though Bancroft will continue in her role for the rest of this season, Grimsby, who are currently trying to avoid the threat of relegation to the National League in League Two, are delighted to have her on board ahead of the 2024/25 season. Chairman Jason Stockwood is delighted with the appointment, insisting the club is 'thrilled' to have secured her services.",
      "He told the Mariners' club website: \"We are absolutely thrilled for Polly to be joining us. There was a tremendous amount of interest in the role and to have someone of Polly's calibre and background join us is a real testament to how the club is regarded.",
      "\"We look forward to welcoming Polly and her family to the area and for her starting once the WSL season has concluded. We'd also like to thank Dave Slemen and the team at EPP who helped us conduct the search.\"",

      "Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal in the Women's Super League at a sold-old Emirates Stadium in what could prove to be a huge blow to the Reds' Champions League hopes",
      "If last season's triumph at the Emirates was evidence of Manchester United's burgeoning Women's Super League (WSL) pedigree, then it was on the same stage that all of the Reds' deficiencies this term were brought into sharp focus.",
      "It was back in November 2022 that Alessia Russo's late strike helped Marc Skinner's side come from behind to claim all three points against the Gunners. But, on Saturday afternoon, the England forward was a second-half substitute for the hosts as they romped to a 3-1 victory in North London, putting United's hopes of European qualification this season of life support.",
      "In truth, the damage was done long before Russo entered the pitch, as a Geyse own goal and efforts from Cloe Lacasse and Kim Little had Arsenal in firm control of the contest before the break. \"We have to be the one to get under the skin and we have to be the team that doesn’t just try and win one way,\" Skinner asserted pre-match.",
      "But from the moment the Gunners got their noses in front at a sold-out Emirates, it was United who looked unnerved by their opponents' intensity. The Reds had started well enough, with Nikita Parris seizing upon a fumbled clearance from Sabrina D'Angelo and flashing an effort just wide of the post.",
      "READ MORE:I wanted to buy United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Ratcliffe",
      "But Skinner's side were made to pay for the spurned opportunity when Katie McCabe's low corner deflected off their no.23 and into the back of the net to give Arsenal the lead inside 10 minutes. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage when Beth Mead's curling shot deflected narrowly wide of Mary Earps' far post, and again when Stina Blackstenius was played through on goal by Cloe Lacasse but, on both occasions, the interventions of Millie Turner proved decisive.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United came close to restoring parity when Ella Toone's strike ricocheted off the leg of Laia Codina and bobbled just off target. But it wasn't long before the Gunners were back on the front foot; Lacasse nodding home after Katie Zelem's miscued clearance arced straight into her path.",
      "The hosts' grip on the contest was further strengthened on the stroke of half-time, when captain Kim Little coolly dispatched the penalty after Beth Mead was upended by Gemma Evans inside the area. With Eidevall's side threatening to run away with it, Skinner unsurprisingly made an attacking change at the break, as Leah Galton was brought on in place of Gemma Evans.",
      "But it was Arsenal who looked the likeliest to find the back of the net; Blackstenius drawing a smart stop from Earps before Mead's strike cannoned off the post. The look of despondency on the face of Parris after she was, for what must have felt like the hundredth time on Saturday afternoon, called offside, spoke volumes about the meekness of United's showing in the capital.",
      "Lucia Garcia's instinctive finish in the final minute of stoppage time proved to be nothing more than a scant consolation prize for the visitors, who will know that only a flawless end to the season will be enough to keep their hopes of winning a Champions League spot alive.",
      "\"I don't think the word 'damaging' is the conversation,\" Skinner reflected post-match when queried on the potential repercussions of the result. \"We're still chasing. We're seven points behind Arsenal. We have to chase and that's what our team are resilient enough to do.\"",
      "On the criticism coming from some quarters of the United fanbase, Skinner added: \"It's part and parcel of the job. Some people love what you do, some people hate what you do. But we would never stop people from having an opinion. That's not what I'm here for.\"",
      "Though Skinner was keen to stress otherwise, Saturday's defeat is hugely detrimental to United's European ambitions. Of course, it is not just the manager who should be held accountable for the result: the Reds failed to perform to their full capacity and the players will know much more is required if they are to prevent this season from going out with a whimper.",
      "For the United boss, though, it is a defeat that raises further question marks around his own future ahead of the expiration of his contract this summer. Certainly, the voices crying for Skinner's removal will continue to grow louder in the days ahead and, at a time where the club as a whole is at the start of a brand new era, it feels like a period of change for the women's team, too, is inevitable.",

      "Saturday 16 March 2024 07:11, UK",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag has rubbished reports suggesting Marcus Rashford could be sold to Paris St-Germain this summer.",
      "The Daily Mirror wrote on Friday that PSG have an interest in the England forward, following speculation this week the French club could be preparing a £75m bid.",
      "PSG are looking for replacement attacking options with star striker Kylian Mbappe heading to Real Madrid - but United boss Ten Hag says Rashford is part of his club's long-term plans after signing a new contract last summer, which runs until 2028.",
      "\"We didn't re-sign him last season for four years [to a new contract] with the intention to sell him. No,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"He should be part of this project. It's not a subject we talk about.\"",
      "Rashford has scored just seven Premier League goals this season, 10 fewer than he managed in an impressive 2022/23 campaign.",
      "However, with strikes in each of his last two appearances, Ten Hag and United supporters will hope to see Rashford deliver again on Sunday, when United host Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. His pace could be a key asset for United, who Ten Hag says will try to get in behind Liverpool's backline.",
      "\"We are very good when there is space in the back of the defending line,\" said Ten Hag. \"That will be also our intention for Sunday, we will go and be brave and go forward where it's possible. We know when there is space in the back of their defending line we can exploit it - but we have to get to that point, to outplay them, get the balls there and that demands good strategy in the key moments.\"",
      "United's attacking options could also be boosted by the return of Rasmus Hojlund. The Denmark international has been out for the past four games with a muscle injury but Ten Hag says Hojlund, along with Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Mason Mount, is now back in full training.",
      "\"We had a good week, [Hojlund, Maguire, Wan-Bissaka] returned on the pitch. Partly at the start of this week and [on Friday] we had a session and they were all training.",
      "\"I think [they're available] we have one session [on Saturday] and we have to see how they recover from this. It looks good.",
      "\"Tom Heaton is back as well. Mason Mount trained all week with us. Some full sessions with us. So it's looking good.\"",
      "Follow Man Utd vs Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday with our live coverage across the Sky Sports website and App, kick-off 3.30pm.",
      "Ten Hag says victory in this cup tie could turn around Man Utd's season.",
      "\"We never got turned around so far [in terms of form],\" he said. \"We had our opportunities but we missed our opportunities. Sunday we have another good opportunity to get the momentum. The players showed lately, from January on, we are in a very good [run] of games, a lot of wins. They have to believe they can do it. Now we have to take the momentum.",
      "\"That is what I feel when I train with them around the games, they have belief, good confidence and good spirit to go and play and get the turnaround.\"",
      "While United could welcome striker Hojlund back to their line-up, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Mohamed Salah is fit and ready to play at Old Trafford, where he'll be hoping to improve a remarkable record against Liverpool's rivals.",
      "Salah has scored 12 goals in 13 matches against United and looks in the mood to extend that streak, after scoring one and setting up three more when he made his first start since New Year's Day in Liverpool's 6-1 demolition of Sparta Prague in the Europa League on Thursday night.",
      "Salah played the full 90 minutes in that match, despite only recently returning from a hamstring problem, but Klopp is convinced the Egypt star can go again on Sunday.",
      "\"Mo is definitely ready,\" said Klopp. \"Ibou [Konate] did not train [on Friday], we have to see if he can train [on Saturday], so it will be a tight race, which we may lose.",
      "\"Bobby [Clark] felt much better, a little swelling, he is fine and Ryan [Gravenberch] trained again so he is ready.\"",
      "On Salah's record against United, he said: \"Mo is pure quality. Ask him what he likes about Manchester United, but the more we talk about it the less likely it is going to happen again, so that is why I don't like to talk too much!",
      "\"He is just an exceptional guy, a world-class player and how we dealt without him was just unbelievable. The boys did well, but it's better to have him around and on the pitch rather than just in the dressing room.",
      "\"So good, we could build it now with minutes and he is ready for Sunday.\"",

      "Wolves host Coventry on Saturday lunchtime, before Newcastle make the daunting trip to the Etihad looking to end Man City's dreams of a double Treble; on Sunday, Championship pacesetters Leicester visit Chelsea, before Man Utd entertain old foes Liverpool",
      "By Sky Sports Football",
      "Saturday 16 March 2024 07:09, UK",
      "For many teams, the FA Cup is a welcome distraction from the pressures of the league season, an opportunity to rotate and play with a bit of freedom. It has not really worked out that way for Gary O'Neil's Wolves - but that seems to have worked in their favour.",
      "Having scrapped their way to a third-round replay with Brentford after securing a draw with 10 players in the initial tie, there was huge pressure to win the second match at Molineux given that a Black Country derby with West Brom awaited Wolves in the fourth round.",
      "That match at the Hawthorns was a must-win for the supporters. And by the time they kicked off their fifth-round fixture at home to Brighton, it was already known that Championship side Coventry stood between Wolves and a Wembley semi-final.",
      "Despite injuries to all three first-choice forwards, the expectation will be that O'Neil's team find a way past the Sky Blues. They would finally be underdogs in the last four and could enjoy the occasion. Before that, there is another high-pressure occasion to negotiate.",
      "If Wolves can manage that, it would continue their surprising success this season. Improbably given their fraught start that had many tipping them for the drop, they still have two routes into Europe - and are just two wins away from a first FA Cup final in 64 years.Adam Bate",
      "A Coventry win at Molineux would make it the second time they have reached the FA Cup semi-finals, with the last time resulting in them going on to successfully lift the trophy in 1987.",
      "The competition also holds a special place in the heart of Sky Blues manager, Mark Robins. He scored the goal that is widely regarded as the one which saved Sir Alex Ferguson's job at Manchester United in 1990.",
      "Discontent was growing amongst supporters, with banners reading 'three years of excuses' at Old Trafford in their defeat to Crystal Palace in the previous month. But it was Robins who nodded the only goal away at Nottingham Forest to seal victory.",
      "United went on to lift the FA Cup that season, beating Crystal Palace 1-0 in a final replay. The rest, as we know it for Ferguson and the club, was history.Ella-Esrene Frederick",
      "Pep Guardiola insists that it is virtually improbable and yet as the season reaches its climax, Manchester City are the favourites to retain the Premier League trophy, favourites to retain the Champions League, and, yes, favourites to lift the FA Cup once again.",
      "This treble had only been achieved once before in the history of English football prior to last season's feat but City are well placed to manage it in back-to-back seasons. Newcastle United are the quarter-final opponents in this FA Cup quarter-final at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "That home draw feels significant because while Newcastle knocked City out of the Carabao Cup at St James' Park in September and it needed a late goal from Oscar Bobb to win the league fixture there, Guardiola's side are unbeaten in front of their own fans all season.",
      "If there is one intriguing aspect for City, it will be the performance of Stefan Ortega. In his role as Ederson's back-up goalkeeper over the past two seasons, the German has impressed - having supporters chant his name soon after his arrival. But this is different.",
      "Injury to the Brazilian means that Ortega could have a key role to play in the closing stages of the campaign. He is a more than capable player with the ball at his feet so should not necessitate any change in style. But eyes will be on him during such an important period.",
      "Ortega aside, with the international break to follow and having had a free week following the exertions against Liverpool last weekend, even an injury to Kevin De Bruyne is unlikely to prevent City from naming a very strong side. The double treble is on.Adam Bate",
      "Eddie Howe joked that he almost drove off the road in shock when he heard on the radio Newcastle had been drawn away to Manchester City in the FA Cup quarter-finals. The Magpies got the better of Pep Guardiola's men earlier this season in the Carabao Cup but a fourth meeting of the season with City is far from ideal.",
      "Especially away from home, where Newcastle are on a run of 18 league visits to City without success. They managed just one shot on target in a limp performance in August. But Newcastle's players need to put it all on the line this Saturday. This has become a defining game for their season.",
      "There is still the prospect of qualifying for the Europa League or Europa Conference League through their league position but a campaign which began with so much hope and excitement could end with something of a whimper if Newcastle's FA Cup run doesn't go beyond this weekend.",
      "A return to Wembley is within reach - and to do that in back-to-back seasons would be a significant achievement for Howe, particularly given the injury issues he and his players have had to battle this term. But they couldn't have a tougher task on their hands to make it there.Peter Smith",
      "It wasn't pretty and it wasn't convincing but Chelsea's 3-2 win over Leeds in the previous round of the FA Cup was celebrated enthusiastically by the home fans at Stamford Bridge. Part of that was down to the rivalry between the sides but perhaps more significantly, it was because the victory came just three days on from their extra-time Carabao Cup final defeat to Liverpool at Wembley. It kept Chelsea's season alive.",
      "The middle of the Premier League is a crowded place and with co-efficient calculations being made on a weekly basis, there is still the possibility Chelsea could secure European football for next season with their league finish. But silverware would give Mauricio Pochettino's project a shot in the arm - and perhaps win him some welcome admiration from the Chelsea fans who, he admits, have been underwhelmed by his output so far.",
      "His winless cup record in England weighs down his reputation but, just as in the Carabao Cup, Chelsea have been handed a favourable draw. Another trip to Wembley beckons. Chelsea can't afford to miss out.Peter Smith",
      "A welcome distraction? Leicester's trip to Chelsea will surely be that given their alarming recent run of results which has threatened to derail what a month ago looked like being a procession to the Championship title. One win in five and three defeats in that stretch - including a galling late collapse at promotion rivals Leeds - has left Enzo Maresca's Foxes reeling.",
      "With Leeds and Ipswich on their tails in the second tier, Leicester will be hoping for a confidence-boosting upset at Stamford Bridge. Evergreen Jamie Vardy, with 10 goals in his last 11 appearances, could be their key weapon but the 37-year-old has just four goals against Chelsea, a team he has played against more times than any other in his career (21).",
      "Can he and Leicester come up with something special this weekend? Regardless of form or standing, Vardy and this team should never be underestimated…Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United last won the FA Cup in 2016, Louis van Gaal plonking the trophy in front of him at the post-final press conference. It was not enough to keep him in a job, having missed out on qualification for the Champions League. But could it save Erik ten Hag?",
      "It has been a difficult Premier League campaign for the club. A fifth-place finish is likely to be enough to secure a spot in Europe's premier club competition next season, but even that appears beyond them. Out of Europe before Christmas, it all comes down to this.",
      "Liverpool, of all teams, are the visitors to Old Trafford on Sunday and though they have bigger prizes to play for, it will be a tough examination for a United team whose frailties have never been too far from the surface. It will need a big performance to progress.",
      "There are big-game players in the United group. This is the sort of occasion that they will hope Casemiro would relish. And how about Bruno Fernandes? One Carabao Cup is scant reward for his contributions in a United shirt. Can the captain seize the day?",
      "Defeat would confirm a trophyless season and accelerate discussions about the direction of travel under Ten Hag. Victory would take them to Wembley and eliminate one of the biggest remaining stumbling blocks to reclaiming the FA Cup. Massive for Manchester United.Adam Bate",
      "Jurgen Klopp takes his Liverpool side to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon with the Reds in red-hot form following Thursday's destruction of Sparta Prague in the Europa League last 16, but against opponents who would love nothing better than to derail their bid for an unprecedented Quadruple.",
      "This will be the Liverpool manager's penultimate visit to the 'Theatre of Dreams', with the Reds also scheduled to face United in the Premier League on April 7, but with some key players starting to return from injury, the visitors will be expected to field a strong-looking starting lineup this weekend.",
      "Both Mohamed Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai proved their return to fitness after recent hamstring injuries by playing the entire game against Sparta at Anfield, although it will still be intriguing to see what side Klopp fields against United.",
      "However, with Liverpool not playing again until they host Brighton and Hove Albion in the top flight after the international break on May 31, it would be a surprise were Klopp not to play his first-choice XI against their fierce rivals.",
      "Either way, Klopp would love nothing better than to triumph one last time at Old Trafford, a ground he has at times struggled to get results at during his time in charge of Liverpool, before departing the club this summer.Richard Morgan",

      "Saturday 16 March 2024 07:08, UK",
      "Our tipster Jones Knows takes aim at the weekend action across the Premier League and FA Cup, offering up his insight and betting analysis.",
      "Backing both teams to score looks a great starting point for what should be a cracking cup tie. Coventry have scored in each of their last 13 away games in all competitions whilst 71 per cent of Wolves' home games this season have seen both teams score.",
      "Since the FA scrapped replays in the fifth round and quarter-finals for the 2019/20 season there have been just seven draws in 56 fifth-round or quarter-final matches - that's just a 12.5 per cent strike rate. I think the withdrawal of replays is making teams go all-out for the win with the thought of extra-time a bit of a hindrance. That's enough to put me off the draw for this encounter and there is a bet to be had to combine goals and no draw.",
      "Sky Bet do offer a special market where we can back both teams to score and the game not to end in a draw, which is coming out at 13/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The market continues to get the goal line all wrong in these battles down at the bottom.",
      "There is a clear trend developing that these type of games between relegation rivals are producing more attacking intent than what the expected models are telling the bookmakers.",
      "Of the 28 games involving both Sheffield United, Luton, Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford this season, the overall goal average has been 3.03 per game - usually that is above the market expectation of edgy and cagey affairs. And 39 per cent of those 27 games have seen four or more goals scored.",
      "In a game Brentford simply have to try and win, it should result in a goal-heavy encounter, especially when you consider their recent defensive record which is spiralling out of control. It's now just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games. Burnley can get in on the act here, so both teams to score and over 2.5 goals looks a lovely bet to attack at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Big game.",
      "At half-time during Luton's clash with Bournemouth, I was ready to side with them at 6/4 with Sky Bet to beat Nottingham Forest. At full-time, I didn't want to be anywhere near that price following their collapse.",
      "Results like that can have a huge effect on confidence and general belief so even though I think they're still the most likely winners, I can swerve them and play the draw.",
      "Luton will cause problems from set pieces. Forest have conceded the most goals from set-pieces (18) in the Premier League this season - that's four more than any other team. And 10 of those have come since Nuno Espirito Santo took the job in December, so he's had no impact on improving the standards.",
      "We need to look at the Luton centre-backs in the goalscorer markets and I've come down on Reece Burke, who has had eight shots in last six games. One might be due and the 40/1 first goalscorer prices with Sky Bet are certainly worth a second look.",
      "For all Tottenham's swashbuckling attacking in the second half vs Aston Villa, they are becoming slow starters in matches. They had just one shot in the first half at Villa Park and failed to score, meaning they've failed to score in five of their last six first halves. And only had 25 shots in those six first halves, works out at just over four per game which is very low for a team chasing Europe.",
      "Now they are heading to a tricky away game to play a Fulham team that have conceded the fewest goals in the opening 15 minutes of matches this season, just one.",
      "I like the Evens available with Sky Bet on the second half to have more goals than the first. This means even if there's a first-half goal, the bet is still live as we just need the second half to outscore the first - it's a bit more of an enjoyable punting experience than just backing under first-half goals as that bet can be over within a few minutes.",
      "In 278 Premier League games this season, there's been 369 first-half goals and 531 second-half goals - so 162 more goals in the second half. That is leading to this bet of more second-half goals landing more frequently than what the market is suggesting with 52 per cent of games this season seeing this bet win, including in eight of Tottenham's last 11 games across all competitions. They can power away again in the second half.",
      "Newcastle's season might just be over come Saturday evening. It doesn't get much tougher than this.",
      "Upsets are rarely seen at this stage of the competition in the FA Cup. In the last 26 games involving Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool or Chelsea in the fifth round or quarter-finals, those teams have won 24 of those 26 games in 90 minutes. And those two defeats both were inflicted by Leicester who were a top-five club at the time and won the trophy in 2021.",
      "Manchester City to win in 90 minutes is the obvious starting point for a bet even at 2/9 with Sky Bet. This is a team that have won each of last 12 FA Cup games at home, scoring 52 goals and lost just one of their last 58 home matches in all competitions.",
      "Heading to the cards market may provide a slice of value though as the 25/1 about no cards being shown in the first player to be carded market looks good to me.",
      "In the last 56 FA Cup fifth-round and quarter-final matches, since replays were scrapped, the average yellow card count per match is just 2.07 - that's just 116 yellow cards in 56 matches. These types of one-sided games can be played out in a friendly environment and the referee can be a little more lenient than usual. There were no cards in Man City's fifth-round fixture at Luton and this one could go the same way.",
      "Chelsea's attack is purring right now. They are in trustworthy mood. In their last eight Premier League games, Chelsea have scored 2.1 goals per game, overperforming their expected goals by about 0.47 per game, which is a complete flip to the period between August and January where they regularly underperformed their xG in front of goal. It's starting to click for Maurico Pochettino and they could be in line to make another major cup final.",
      "Leicester head here in a strange spot - is this a game they really need? They are wobbling slightly in the Championship, winning just one of their last five and conceding two goals in four of those matches. Ipswich and Leeds are hunting them down, so I'm not sure this is a helpful game for them. Chelsea to win and over 3.5 goals at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a decent wager.",
      "Ollie Watkins remains a player of interest in the goalscorer markets against teams outside the \"big six\" - it was no surprise he drew a blank vs Tottenham last week as his record against elite opposition is now just six goals in 17 appearances.",
      "However, he is a killer when it comes to scoring against non \"big six\" teams where his record of 23 goals in 35 games under Unai Emery is fantastic. That works out at a goal every 132 minutes and he is a massive runner to find the net in this one at the odds we can play at. I'd advise a close look at both the 5/1 with Sky Bet on him scoring first and the 6/4 on offer for him to score anytime.",
      "Regular readers will know all about the sustainable edge we've been exploiting this season regarding Manchester United's ability to ship corners. The market still hasn't noticed, which is great news here where the Liverpool corner line is very backable.",
      "United's 10-game Premier League average of corners conceded now stands at 8.3 per 90 minutes after Everton surpassed the market's expected line and won eight at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "But that corner-conceded average rises to a completely bonkers 11.5 corners conceded in the last seven games against the top five in the Premier League.",
      "They shipped 10 away at Villa, 13 at home to Spurs, six at home to Villa, 12 away at Liverpool, 12 at home to Man City, 12 at Arsenal and a staggering 15 in the recent league game with Man City - 12 coming in the first half.",
      "United do have a tendency under Erik ten Hag to stay in matches despite giving up so much territory and possession, so I can see Liverpool racking up plenty of corners as they hunt a way through. Jurgen Klopp's men are averaging 6.9 corners per 90 this season, and have won seven or more corners in 25 of their 44 matches, so a 55 per cent strike. When you factor in the opposition and their woeful corners against record averages, getting 5/4 with Sky Bet on Liverpool winning seven or more corners is a real gift.",

      "Thursday 14 March 2024 22:03, UK",
      "Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite and Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon have received their first England senior call-ups for this month's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium, while Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been recalled.",
      "Toney's recall comes after returning to action in January following the completion of his eight-month Football Association ban for breaching betting rules. The 27-year-old has scored four goals in nine appearances for Brentford since his comeback.",
      "But West Ham midfielder Kalvin Phillips has been left out of the 25-man squad by England boss Gareth Southgate after a torrid run of form since joining the Hammers on loan in January.",
      "Goalkeepers:  Sam Johnstone (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal).\n\nDefenders: Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Lewis Dunk (Brighton), Joe Gomez (Liverpool), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Harry Maguire (Man Utd), John Stones (Man City), Kyle Walker (Man City).\n\nMidfielders: Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), James Maddison (Tottenham), Declan Rice (Arsenal).\n\nForwards: Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Phil Foden (Man City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Marcus Rashford (Man United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa).",
      "The Manchester City loanee was at fault for a goal on his debut against Bournemouth before he was sent off at Nottingham Forest last month and hooked at half-time of Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Burnley.",
      "Southgate said: \"I think he knows exactly what we think of him. A good version of him is an important player for us and that's why we've supported him as we have.",
      "\"Unfortunately his form hasn't been good enough and I've spoken to him about that. He understands.",
      "\"He has all the attributes to force his way back in. He just needs to find that rhythm and confidence because there is an outstanding player in there.\"",
      "Phillips' West Ham team-mate Jarrod Bowen has been recalled following his recent fine form, while Liverpool defender Joe Gomez is named in an England squad for the first time in four years.",
      "But Southgate revealed Arsenal defender Ben White, who signed a new four-year contract with the Premier League leaders on Thursday, did not want to be considered for England squads \"at the moment\".",
      "White left England's 2022 World Cup squad mid-tournament to return home for personal reasons and reports later emerged of an alleged bust-up with England assistant Steve Holland.",
      "Southgate said: \"He [White] is not available to us and there is no issue between us at all and I also should say there is never any issue with (coach) Steve Holland because that has been mentioned in articles and I don't like that.",
      "\"I want that door wide open. He would be in this squad but he's not available to us and I have to focus on who can help us.\"",
      "Chelsea left-back Ben Chilwell has been called up despite a knee issue, but Blues team-mate Raheem Sterling was once again absent from the squad.",
      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has been included despite his muscle problem, but Manchester City's Jack Grealish misses out due to a groin injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea forward Cole Palmer and Aston Villa duo Ollie Watkins and Ezri Konsa retain their places in the squad.",
      "Branthwaite's maiden England call-up comes after a fine breakthrough season with Everton.",
      "Southgate said: \"He's good with the ball, shows good composure, good mentality. He's a left-footer and we don't have many left-footed defenders.",
      "\"He's in on merit and we're keen to find out more about him.\"",
      "Gordon was another to earn a first call-up to Southgate's squad after scoring 10 times for Newcastle this season in all competitions.",
      "\"Consistently good performances. He was very close in November and he's continued his form,\" Southgate explained.",
      "\"He is scoring, his work for the team is excellent and he competes, so I really like his attitude.\"",
      "With just three months to go until their Euro 2024 tournament opener against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen, England face a pair of high-profile warm-up friendlies at Wembley against Brazil on March 23 and Belgium on March 26.",
      "This is the last camp before Southgate names his provisional Euros squad just after the Premier League season concludes, with the final selection to be submitted to UEFA on June 8.",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Rob Dorsett:",
      "Until this England squad, Gareth Southgate had protected Kalvin Phillips.",
      "He continued to pick him through his leanest of spells and played him for England when he could not get in the Manchester City team.",
      "But now, Southgate made it clear that Phillips' form is simply too poor for him to justify his inclusion in an England squad.",
      "Southgate says Phillips is still in his thoughts for the Euros: he is a rare talent, his \"profile\" (as a diligent holding midfielder) is equally rare, and there is still time for him to force his way back into the England fold before the Euros squad is finalised in three months' time.",
      "But it is clear that it will need an extraordinary turnaround in form from Phillips for that to happen - particularly when Southgate can only name 23 players for Germany, compared with the 26 he was allowed in the Covid-affected tournament three years ago.",
      "With that in mind, Southgate admitted it might be difficult for him to fit three out-and-out strikers in his Euros squad.",
      "Ivan Toney is back in this squad at the first time of asking, since his eight-month suspension for breaching the FA's betting rules that cost him the possibility of eight England caps.",
      "But will Toney keep his place alongside Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins for the tournament? \"Maybe, maybe not,\" admitted Southgate.",
      "One of the big pluses for the England boss is Marcus Rashford, who can play as a number nine as well as a winger.",
      "Harry Kane, inevitably, will be first-choice striker, but Southgate may not have the luxury or the space to include two other strikers, when it's decision time in June.",
      "That is why this international break - with friendlies against the two sides ranked fourth and fifth in the world by FIFA - are so key for both Watkins and Toney to try to prove themselves.",

      "Throughout March and every Premier League Saturday across the month, the jackpot will roll over if it isn't won.",
      "A winner came close for the second consecutive rollover round, with 32 Super 6 players making it through to Sunday's two fixtures with their eyes firmly set on scooping the £500,000 jackpot.",

      "Fear not - if the round isn't won by Sunday evening, there will be a whopping £1,000,000 round on Saturday March 30, how's that for a tasty return following the international break?",
      "The 32 players that made it through to Sky Sports Super Sunday's two fixtures is the most we have seen this season, however what was to come would have blown out the rest of the pack, never mind the remaining players in the hunt for £500,000.",
      "Remarkably, only 127 entrants correctly predicted Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham at Villa Park, and that scoreline thwarted any hopes of a jackpot winner.",
      "Warren from Maidenhead did come closest to winning the £500,000 jackpot as he predicted FIVE correct scorelines. In the Aston Villa match, he was only two goals away from winning the jackpot, however stoppage time goals from Heung-Min Son and Timo Werner crushed his hopes.",
      "All was not lost, as Warren's outstanding predictions, earned him the Top Scorer prize of £6,000!",

      "Ange Postecoglou is remaining grounded despite Tottenham basking in the afterglow of a significant victory in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "Last Sunday's clash at Villa Park pitted fourth against fifth, with hosts Aston Villa knowing victory would move them eight points clear in the last Premier League spot guaranteed a place at Europe's top table.",
      "Spurs have a game in hand against Villa - away to Chelsea - while a third straight win over Fulham this weekend, live on Sky Sports, would see them overtake Unai Emery's side.",
      "Put to Postecoglou that it was quite the swing avoiding an eight-point gap and instead cutting Villa's advantage to two, he said: \"I guess so. I said before the game that I still think there's a significant part of the season to go. There's still 11 games for us anyway.",
      "\"There's so many challenging games and every game will have meaning between now and the end of the year. Not just for us, for every team.",
      "\"There's a fight at the top, there's a fight down the bottom, there's a fight in the middle somewhere, so we're all fighting for something.",
      "\"If we had lost today, I don't think that would have discounted us from whatever other people put on as targets for us.",
      "\"I've been consistent saying what's important for me is our growth as a team and I thought we saw that today. It was another positive step forward.\"",
      "The quest to qualify for the Champions League is as tense as the three-way title race - further enhanced by the element of the unknown. For the first time, five Premier League teams could qualify through their league position.",
      "Jamie Carragher said: \"In the same way the race for the title could come down to goal difference, it could play a huge part in qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"We're not quite sure if it will be the 'top four' or the 'top five; but the eight-goal swing for Tottenham on Aston Villa at the weekend is huge.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: \"Tottenham have the confidence and the momentum. You've got people coming off the bench and scoring goals. Right now, there will be a feel-good factor around Spurs. It's a big result for them and a huge setback for Villa.\"",
      "United bounced back from two defeats on the spin with victory over Everton last weekend. Despite facing 23 shots, Andre Onana kept an eighth clean sheet of the season. Only David Raya has kept more.",
      "\"At the very least you have to finish in the top five so it's hard to tell right now,\" continued Keane when asked to assess United's Champions League chances. \"The main thing for Man Utd is to be consistent and to win football matches. They have to hope others slip up.",
      "\"I think it's bit of a stretch to catch Aston Villa in fourth so it'll come down to if that fifth place is available. They just have to keep their heads on and win matches.\"",
      "Villa have a Europa Conference League last-16 second leg at home to Ajax to contend with before returning to Premier League action at West Ham next weekend.",
      "Emery wants to refocus on Thursday's match and move on from a second half he called a \"very bad day in the office\".",
      "Micah Richards said: \"Villa have been excellent this season and can regroup. They've had a few dodgy results but Unai Emery is doing a great job there.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins was a little but off it [against Tottenham]. You have to adjust your system to whoever you're playing against and we know Spurs are good down the wings.\"",
      "Keane added: \"It looked like that European game had an affect on them. They were five or 10 per cent off and that was enough to cause a bad result.\"",
      "During Emery's first year as Arsenal boss, the Gunners lost out on the top four and were defeated in the Europa League final.",
      "Carragher is fearful that Villa could suffer the same fate if the manager tinkers with his personnel and system as he did towards the end of the 2018/19 season.",
      "\"We have loved them this season, but it takes me a little bit back to Arsenal during his first full season,\" Carragher told Sky Sports.",
      "\"He gets a lot of criticism for that season, but actually for a lot of it, he was doing well. But towards the end of the season, because they were in the Europa League, they were in a great position in terms of the top four.",
      "\"We can see that with seven games of the season to go, and they got into the quarter-finals, the semi-finals and then the final of the Europa League. And they just miss out because Unai Emery started changing his team with personnel, change in formation.",
      "\"He did a lot of back threes and back fours at Arsenal, and in the end he ended up with nothing. They missed out on the Champions League and they lost the final to Chelsea. He's got to be really careful.",
      "\"I hope for Aston Villa's sake, it's a one-off in doing something different because of Tottenham and the teams who were playing Tottenham, and get back to being what Aston Villa have been about this season.\"",
      "Manchester United have the slight upper hand when it comes to the average league position of their remaining opposition. The average current league position of United's remaining opponents is 11.3, compared to 10.9 for Spurs and 8.3 for Aston Villa.",
      "But in his latest column, Paul Merson believes Villa can wrestle back control ahead of a pivotal weekend.",
      "Merson wrote: \"That Tottenham game was one of Aston Villa's biggest games in years. And they got blown away.",
      "\"I've seen two teams destroy them in the last two weeks, Newcastle and Tottenham. All they did was press high and suffocate them. Under that sort of pressure they haven't had a clue or a different plan. That's worrying.",
      "\"But you'd take this situation if you were a Villa fan. It's amazing. They're dreaming but it's football and we're allowed to dream. They're still in it. Spurs still have to play Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City. If they get three points out of those games they've had a result. A Villa win at West Ham puts them back in a strong position.\"",
      "The challengers have similar run-ins, with four opponents - Aston Villa, Brighton, Tottenham and Wolves - common to all three. Liverpool have Villa away but Spurs and Brighton at home, the inverse of City and Arsenal's fixtures, while Wolves welcome Arsenal to Molineux but travel to City and Liverpool.",
      "Tottenham's visit on the weekend of April 27 stands out among Arsenal's fixtures and Liverpool also face a derby, with a date to be confirmed for their trip to Everton. City have completed their engagements against local rivals Manchester United, who still have to play Liverpool and Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Liverpool have bottom club Sheffield United still to play, while Arsenal and City both host 18th-placed Luton. The average current league position of Arsenal's remaining opponents is 9.3, compared to 9.5 for City and 10.1 for Liverpool.",

      "Match report and free highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford penalties, won by player of the match Alejandro Garnacho, secure a 2-0 win for Manchester United against Everton; free match highlights available on Sky Sports' digital platforms from 5.15pm",
      "Saturday 9 March 2024 17:15, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford scored first-half penalties as Manchester United bounced back from defeat to Manchester City with a 2-0 win over struggling Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho won both spot-kicks with Fernandes coolly converting the first of them before handing the second to Rashford, allowing the winger to find the net for a second successive game after his long-range stunner in last weekend's derby.",
      "Manchester United's performance was sloppy at times but Everton's wastefulness in front of goal ensured it was a comfortable victory for Erik ten Hag's side, putting them within three points of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have two games in hand.",
      "Sean Dyche's side finished the game with 23 shots to Manchester United's 15 - the most by an away side at Old Trafford all season - but once again demonstrated a glaring lack of cutting edge in front of goal as their Premier League winless run stretched to 11 games - equalling a club record set in 1994.",
      "The Toffees remain 16th, five points above the drop zone, but defeat gives their relegation rivals a chance to reduce the gap.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (7), Lindelof (6), Varane (7), Dalot (7), Evans (7), Casemiro (5), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (8), Garnacho (8), McTominay (6), Rashford (7).\n\n\nSubs: Amrabat (6), Kambwala (6), Antony (6).\n\n\nEverton: Pickford (7), Godfrey (5), Tarkowski (6), Branthwaite (7), Mykolenko (5), Harrison (6), Onana (6), Garner (6), McNeil (7), Doucoure (5), Beto (5).\n\n\nSubs: Calvert-Lewin (5), Gomes (6), Dobbin (6), Young (6), Chermiti (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Alejandro Garnacho",
      "The injury-hit hosts reached half-time two goals to the good but their first-half performance was beset by sloppiness as they repeatedly gifted possession to Everton in their own half.",
      "Dwight McNeil, Amadou Onana and Ben Godfrey were among those to spurn chances for the visitors, however, and, up at the other end, they were punished by the dangerous Garnacho.",
      "The first penalty was won when he shimmied away from James Tarkowski, drawing a clear foul from the Everton centre-back, with Fernandes putting the spot-kick out of Jordan Pickford's reach to notch his first Premier League goal since November.",
      "Garnacho was then clumsily brought down in the box for a second time, with Godfrey the culprit. Fernandes' unconventional decision to give the spot-kick to Rashford paid off as the 26-year-old sent Pickford the wrong way following a stuttering run-up.",
      "Pickford made a stunning save from a Fernandes free-kick in between the two penalties, with Manchester United becoming more threatening as the half went on.",
      "The hosts had more opportunities after the break, mostly on the counter-attack, with Garnacho not quite able to turn home a low cross by Fernandes from one of several chances and Victor Lindelof seeing a close-range effort repelled following a corner.",
      "Everton, meanwhile, continued to find space in the Manchester United half to no avail, with Abdoulaye Doucoure seeing a near-post effort saved by Andre Onana and Dominic Calvert-Lewin failing to turn home a cross-shot by fellow substitute Lewis Dobbin.",
      "Calvert-Lewin also sent a free header from a corner straight at Onana as Everton continued to pepper the United goal, but their bluntness was such that there was no real sense of jeopardy for the hosts as the second half meandered towards its conclusion.",
      "The win, much-needed after back-to-back Premier League defeats against Fulham and Manchester City, boosts Manchester United's European hopes. For winless Everton, meanwhile, at risk of getting sucked back into trouble, the picture looks increasingly bleak.",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag: \"I was very pleased with the pressing and also the defending of the box. The only thing that could be better is keeping more of the ball, be more calm on the ball, playing more give-and-gos.",
      "\"When you have a high press, you can't go all the time with long balls because you stretch the pitch and we don't actually want that. But all over, a good performance and good result.",
      "\"It was a team performance but especially our back four and our goalkeeper in the back and Casemiro in the front. They have done very well.",
      "\"The way we defended set-plays was very good, really well organised and focused and everyone did their job. From the second phase, they had some opportunities, but overall, I think we did quite well.\"",
      "On the second penalty: \"They decided on the pitch together. But we have more very good penalty takers in our squad, Bruno is one, Rashy is one, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen as well, plus others.",
      "\"That's very good when you have that in your squad. When you get [two] at such short notice, two different penalty takers makes it harder for the opposition and the goalkeeper.\"",
      "On Garnacho: \"It's about him and if he can keep the focus. If he puts the right effort in during a game and during the week, because sometimes for young players it's difficult because they are inexperienced.",
      "\"As a coaching staff, we have a job to do, but he is able to keep this focus and attitude and he will improve from game to game and that's what we see. We are very pleased with his performance.",
      "\"With young players, you always have to tell them [to keep focus in the week]. In the week, you win your game and there we have to work very well in training session and meetings, we have to be spot on to get the performance at the weekend.",
      "\"I love to work with him, just like the other players in the squad. He is a player who needs a challenge, likes a challenge, he's very brave and confident and our job is to push him to higher levels.",
      "\"But he is doing this. He has a high potential and now we have to get the potential out. You have to work day by day and when you are young, you don't know what it is to play in a high competitive leave, to perform every third day.",
      "\"You need that experience and you have to perform in every training session to get better because there are so many areas for them to improve.\"",
      "\"We know our position in the league and it's not enough for us. We want to try and get into the spots for the Champions League. We know it's going to be tough and difficult but we have to win these games.",
      "\"We didn't win against Fulham. That was not good enough. Then we go away to City and we don't win two games in a row. It gets tough. Aston Villa is doing really well, in moments Tottenham are being really good. It will be more difficult for us than them but we have to push.\"",
      "On handing the second penalty to Marcus Rashford: \"We both kick the penalties. I asked Marcus if he wanted to take and he said he was confident. He is one of the penalty takers that the manager chooses. I felt I had my one, Rashy could get his goal from the penalty.\"",
      "Everton boss Sean Dyche: \"With all due respect to the squads I've had, I've never been here and had that many chances or opportunities. It's very frustrating and we've had a run of that.",
      "\"We've been performing correctly in so many ways but the scoreline is the stat that's important. That's the bit we're getting on the wrong side of and we've got to continually work on it to change it.",
      "\"The two penalties are soft. They are penalties, but they're soft from our point of view, just not shuffling your feet quick enough and dealing with the moment, which we've done very well. It's a tough one for me. I'm not going to over question the defensive side of the team because I think it's been strong this season.",
      "\"I spoke to the players after the game and you've got to get hurt to score a goal sometimes, as Brian Clough used to say. It can't all be glorious goals, you've got to get hurt and that's what I'm not seeing.",
      "\"We're getting into areas that might be awkward goals or be hungry enough to get hurt to score a goal, and that's got to change. Once you start scoring those, you then start scoring the nice ones and that's the order it needs to be done in.",

      "Plus: Kai Havertz is finally embraced at Arsenal after Brentford heroics; Crystal Palace improving under new boss Oliver Glasner despite conceding late equaliser against Luton; Wolves full-backs step up for injured forwards to continue surprising season",
      "Saturday 9 March 2024 21:54, UK",
      "This was an important win for Manchester United. Alejandro Garnacho was impressive. Marcus Rashford scored for a second successive game. Bruno Fernandes, meanwhile, found the net in the Premier League for the first time since November.",
      "But, for all those positives, it is difficult to watch Erik ten Hag's side right now without wondering what has become of one of their most expensive additions. Casemiro continues to confound.",
      "The Brazilian was the main culprit in a bewilderingly sloppy first-half performance by the hosts, repeatedly squandering possession in his own half with errant passes, often under no pressure.",
      "At the interval, his completion rate was below 70 per cent. At full-time, it was not much better. In fact, at 76 per cent, it was the second-lowest of any United player, excluding their goalkeeper.",
      "Casemiro lost possession 17 times overall, a total exceeded by only Everton defender Ben Godfrey among all outfield players on show at Old Trafford - and one he has reached on four separate occasions over the course of the campaign.",
      "A high rate of possession losses can be excused for those players whose job it is to take risks in order to create chances. But that is not the responsibility of a holding midfielder and Casemiro - creator of only 11 opportunities this season - is no exception.",
      "In fairness, the 32-year-old has always been more adventurous than most with his passing from that position. But, in this Manchester United team, one which has major issues exerting control of games, it looks more of a hindrance than a help.",
      "On this occasion, of course, it did not matter. United's first-half penalties went unanswered thanks to the toothlessness of their opponents. But the Casemiro conundrum continues.Nick Wright",
      "Once again, a lack of goals cost Everton on Saturday. All the components were there, especially in the opening half an hour - great football, taking advantage of numerous Man Utd errors and some very good chances.",
      "But despite having 23 shots - the most by an away side at Old Trafford all season - there was nothing to show from it apart from two clumsy errors in the opposing box and another defeat.",
      "As the game's commentator contemplated - Everton are the boxer without the knockout punch. Perhaps a watch back of Anthony Joshua's second-round win against Francis Ngannou last night might be of some inspiration.",
      "And even manager Sean Dyche said: \"You've got to get hurt to score a goal sometimes.\"",
      "And that's not to say that Everton don't have the bravery, heart and talent - they do. But something is clearly not clicking up front for them at the moment - the Toffees have a shot conversion rate of just 7.3 per cent in the Premier League this season, scoring 29 goals from 397 shots - their lowest rate in a campaign on record in the competition (since 1997-98).",
      "With a three week break now ahead of them, and a working trip to Europe planned, Everton's priority must be goalscoring. It is the one missing piece of the puzzle to keep them from pushing up the table.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Not even Mikel Arteta could have seen this Kai Havertz story arc coming.",
      "\"If somebody told me after the first two or three months that the whole stadium would be singing his song with that passion, with that feeling, with that chemistry, I would have found it hard to believe,\" said Arteta after the win over Brentford.",
      "Havertz's early days at Arsenal were clouded by criticism that largely originated from online trolls but permeated into the terraces at the Emirates. No one was sure of his position while every error was clipped up and shared a thousand times over.",
      "This only served to feed the narrative that Arsenal had made a major error in paying Chelsea £65m for the once highly thought of prospect from Germany yet to truly convince in the Premier League.",
      "Havertz felt like he might be the next big name to see his performances drop in the face of widespread - and often unfair - criticism. His start to life in an Arsenal shirt was subdued, but not deserving of the treatment it received. Arteta always stood by the 24-year-old.",
      "The win over Brentford was the fourth league game running that Havertz has scored in playing as Arsenal's makeshift striker. That's the same number of goals he'd scored in his previous 32 games.",
      "Something has finally clicked for the forward in north London and Saturday's scenes of jubilation show he is now being embraced. \"That's what happens to good people,\" Arteta added.Zinny Boswell",
      "Crystal Palace had scored three goals in three of their previous four home games. But none of those performances saw them as dominant as they were in this 1-1 draw with Luton. You have to go back to the opening day of the season win at Sheffield United to find a match where they had more shots. Five big chances created, according to Opta, is a season-high, too.",
      "Yet some wasteful finishing from first-half goalscorer Jean-Philippe Mateta, and bad fortune for Eberechi Eze and Odsonne Edouard, who rattled the bar, combined to give Luton the opportunity for a last-gasp leveller. Selhurst Park was stunned when Cauley Woodrow's header went in off a post. They had already started celebrating a second home win for new boss Oliver Glasner.",
      "But it was perhaps a familiar feeling. The 10 Premier League goals Crystal Palace have conceded after the 90th-minute this season is unmatched by any other side. Glasner admitted there may be a mental issue for his players, such is the frequency of the late goals they've let in - but he also pointed out that his side were on the front foot for much of the six added minutes, just as they had been for the majority of the game.",
      "It's a painful blow to take into a three-week break in matches. But already, with limited training ground time, Glasner has made his mark on Palace's play. Now he has a good coaching window to further instil his methods. The aim will be for Palace to come out fighting after the international break and reclaim some of the points these late goals have cost them…Peter Smith",
      "Drawing at home with Sheffield United doesn't look good, especially when the opposition have just become the first team in English football history to lose three straight home games by five or more goals. But Bournemouth can take a lot of encouragement forward based on their performance, especially when chasing the game at 2-0 down.",
      "Before this game, Andoni Iraola's team were the only side in the Premier League this season yet to take any points when behind at the break. They rallied with great tenacity and quality when tasked with the challenge. In total they posted a whopping 32 shots - the third most racked up by a team in a Premier League game this season. It might just be one win in their last nine Premier League games now but Iraola's Bournemouth remain an exciting prospect.Lewis Jones",
      "Wolves have beaten Tottenham twice and Manchester City this season, but a home victory against bottom-half Fulham has made boss Gary O'Neil the proudest.",
      "\"It's the best win of the season,\" he said after losing Pedro Neto and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde to first-half injuries. \"Today surprised me.\"",
      "O'Neil was already without top scorers Hee-Chan Hwang and Matheus Cunha yet it was typical of the style he has implemented so quickly that his full-backs made the telling contributions.",
      "Rayan Ait-Nouri fired them ahead and then right-back Nelson Semedo saw his shot diverted in off Tom Cairney. Who needs forwards?",
      "O'Neil's Wolves are one of the season's stories and sitting one point off the top seven, there are still more chapters to be told.David Richardson",

      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed why he let Marcus Rashford take Manchester United's second penalty against Everton, having scored the first one himself.",
      "The Man Utd captain - the usual penalty taker for the club - scored from the spot in the 12th minute after Alejandro Garnacho was clipped by James Tarkowski inside the area.",
      "Around 20 minutes later, Garnacho won another penalty, this time fouled by Ben Godfrey. This time, it was Rashford who took and scored the spot kick.",
      "When asked why he did so, Fernandes told TNT Sport: \"We both kick the penalties. I asked Marcus if he wanted to take and he said he was confident. He is one of the penalty takers that the manager chooses.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was the first player to win two penalties in a single Premier League game since Antonio Rudiger for Chelsea against Leeds in December 2021, and first ever to do so for Manchester United in the competition.",
      "\"I felt I had my one, Rashy could get his goal from the penalty.\"",

      "It is not the first time Fernandes has handed the ball to Rashford for a penalty this season either. He also did so against Everton in the reverse fixture in November, which the England forward scored in a 3-0 win.",
      "He said at the time: \"I felt Marcus needed a little bit of confidence. He needs his goal. Marcus is an excellent penalty taker too, I was 100 per cent sure he could score that penalty.",
      "\"It's not about who takes it, it's about scoring the penalty and Marcus did it perfectly.",

      "Ratcliffe has put together a 10-strong task force to examine the possibility of redeveloping the existing stadium or building a new ground, with former Manchester United captain Neville part of the panel.",
      "The 49-year-old said: \"I'm incredibly fortunate to have had the privilege of playing hundreds of games at Old Trafford, and no one can take away those amazing memories.",
