      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has insisted that Tottenham will never win the Premier League, claiming his former Red Devils are more likely to lift the trophy sooner",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has made clear he believes Tottenham will never win a Premier League title, despite their fine form under Ange Postecoglou so far this term.",
      "This isn't the first time the legandary former Manchester United boss has made clear what he thinks of the north Londoners. 15 years ago, Ferguson issued his famous 'Lads, it's Tottenham' team-talk to whip his own players into shape and remind them that they were the superior outfit.",
      "A decade-and-a-half later, it doesn't look like much has changed in terms of Ferguson's views on Spurs. He did make the claim while at Newbury Racecourse, just hours before Postecoglou's side enjoyed a dramatic last-gasp home win over Brighton to go fourth in the table.",
      "Brennan Johnson bagged a rare strike in the 96th minute to seal Spurs' comeback, after Pape Matar Sarr had bagged their equaliser following Pascal Gross' first-half penalty that put the Seagulls in front. The win only widens the gap between Spurs and Ferguson's beloved United, who are in action on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Red Devils make the trip to Aston Villa aiming to keep their faint hopes of Champions League qualification alive. Though United are nine points adrift off fourth-placed Spurs, Ferguson still believes Postecoglou and Co. are way off competing for the biggest honours.",
      "Pressed for comment on if he thinks Spurs will ever win the Premier League, Ferguson told Sky Sports: \"No!\", as he failed to hold back his laughter at the sheer thought of the idea that they could ever be champions.",
      "\"No, ’61 was the last time they won it, well that’s a long time. The opposition today with Liverpool and Manchester City being so powerful in the Premier League. Even for United now, we’re having to fight.\"",
      "He was then asked if it was more likely that Spurs would win a league title before United win another one, to which he rather emphatically replied: \"No chance!\"",
      "Now led by Erik ten Hag, United have endured a difficult season so far having already lost nine of their 23 league games. They are a whopping 14 points behind local rivals and 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City, who sit second in the table.",
      "United's last title triumph came under Ferguson himself, when he guided the club to the 2012/13 crown before calling time on his illustrious career. The closest they have come since was in 2021, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took the club to second in the table, 12 points behind champions City.",

      "Erik ten Hag has told his Manchester United players ahead of Sunday’s showdown with Aston Villa: “Every game is a final”.",
      "Ten Hag knows he must deliver Champions League football if he is to hang on to his job beyond the summer. Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations and not even winning the FA Cup in 2016 could save Louis van Gaal from the sack when he missed out on the top four.",
      "Ratcliffe is busy putting the building blocks in place to reshape United after years in the wilderness and Ten Hag must prove over the remainder of the campaign that he can be part of that future.",
      "United jumped above West Ham into sixth when they beat the Hammers at Old Trafford last Sunday and they can close to within five points of fourth-placed Villa if they win at Villa Park on Sunday.",
      "The game is huge for United and Ten Hag has not shied away from telling his players how important the run-in is for them. “I’ve said to the team from the start of January that every game is now a final,” said the United boss.",
      "“That was also our approach to West Ham United, and we were one point behind them, so this is a final. So let’s take on this challenge. We have to see this as a final. That will be every game from now on, for us. We’re already in that mood.”",
      "United achieved their result of the season when they battled back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 against Villa on Boxing Day at Old Trafford. That victory has been a catalyst for their campaign and they have lost just one of their last six games.",
      "Their five-match unbeaten run is their best of their testing season and they have banged in 11 goals in winning their last three matches. Youngsters Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo are delivering goals and Ten Hag feels his team is finally playing how he wants.",
      "Ten Hag knows Villa Park will be the acid test of United’s mini-revival and Unai Emery’s side have lost just one league game at home all season. The Dutchman is impressed by the transformation Emery has engineered at Villa and knows his side have to be at their best to win.",
      "“It’s very good how he develops this team and it’s very clear how they want to play in and out of possession,” he said. “I think the players know exactly what they have to do, their jobs and how they have to contribute with each other. They’re a really good team and they have weapons in their team. We have to play our maximum levels to get the result.”",

      "Erik ten Hag's men currently sit sixth in the table, nine points adrift off the Champions League qualification places but a win at Villa Park would see that difference reduced to five. United come into the game with some momentum under their belt, having won their last three in all competitions.",
      "It has been an underwhelming season for the Old Trafford faithful, who would have expected better from their side when it comes to league form. The January transfer window came and went without any new signings arriving, meaning Ten Hag will have to get a tune out of what he's already got between now and May.",
      "In contrast, Villa have enjoyed a stellar campaign so far, exceeding the expectations of just about everyone. It is Tottenham who currently occupy the much-coveted fourth spot, but a win for Emery's men would see them leapfrog Spurs into the top four.",
      "The two teams will face off at Villa Park at 4:30pm on Sunday, February 11. Last time the two teams met at Old Trafford, it was United who came away with all three points.",
      "It was a thrilling encounter, with Villa racing into a two-goal lead before a spirited second-half comeback saw United turn the game on its head and win 3-2. Rasmus Hojlund netted his first ever league goal for the club more than four months after his arrival from Atalanta.",
      "In the Premier League-era, these two teams have gone head-to-head on 57 occasions. In that spell, United have been the dominant force with 39 victories. As for Villa, they have only managed five wins in that time, with 13 draws.",
      "The game will be screened live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage will begin on both channels at 4pm, though Sunday's first clash sees Arsenal visit West Ham and can also be watched on both of the aforementioned channels from 1pm.",

As a result, the Argentina international is expected to spend another eight weeks sidelined, just a month after his initial return from a lengthy lay-off.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka was on the road to recovery but has suffered a minor set-back in training and will not feature. The game also comes to soon for the likes of Mason Mount, Tyrell Malacia and Anthony Martial.",
      "As for Villa, they are set to be boosted by the return of Pau Torres. The centre-back is believed to be on the verge of his first start in eight weeks. Lucas Digne is also aiming for a first run-out of 2024, but Ezri Konsa will not appear due to a sprained knee.",

      "Manchester United travel to face Aston Villa on Sunday and Erik ten Hag will hope that his players remember Sir Alex Ferguson's words of warning from the start of this season",
      "On the opening weekend of the 2023-24 Premier League season, Sir Alex Ferguson raised eyebrows.",
      "The legendary former Manchester United manager made a brief appearance on a US broadcaster while his beloved Red Devils prepared to host Wolves back in August, and he was asked which team had impressed him most from the first round of fixtures. Unsurprisingly, Ferguson pointed a team involved in the thrilling match at St James' Park which saw a powerful Newcastle side thrash Aston Villa 5-1. The surprise? It wasn't the winning side.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I watched Aston Villa and I can't believe the scoreline,\" Ferguson told NBC Sports. \"Honestly, Aston Villa played fantastic football and just lost to bad goals.",
      "\"Newcastle are going to be very difficult to beat, in their own ground in particular, and their manager [Eddie Howe] has done a great job there. It's a surprising game, football. You can play teams off the pitch and not score - that's what Aston Villa did.\"",
      "Since then, Villa have only lost four top-flight games and are currently in the Champions League spots. Now it's time for United to once again face Villa, having narrowly beaten them at home on Boxing Day by staging an epic second-half comeback.",
      "Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund earned the win and Ferguson will've loved to see two youngsters do the business. Two for Garnacho and one for Hojlund was the same story when the Red Devils won 3-0 at home to West Ham on Sunday, making it four wins out of five in 2024.",
      "Your turn! Will Manchester United beat Aston Villa? Let us know your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "But the trip to Villa Park is set to be United's toughest test of the new year, having suffered a 3-1 defeat there last season, most memorable to supporters for marking Cristiano Ronaldo's final appearance in a United shirt. It was also Unai Emery's first game as Villa manager, as the Spaniard showed the Premier League that he wasn't to be trifled with three years after his sacking at Arsenal.",
      "Emery's Villa went unbeaten at home in the Premier League between February 18, 2023 and last Tuesday, when they lost 3-1 to, coincidentally, Howe's Newcastle. Having hammered bottom dwellers Sheffield United 5-0 on Saturday, the Villains will be full of confidence and eager to reinforce Ferguson's point."

      "Harry Maguire’s retrial for assault and bribery has been put on hold for more than a year - and may never go ahead at all.",
      "The Manchester United star was due to plead his innocence at a hearing this week on the Greek island of Mykonos, but a legal strike has seen it postponed. Lawyers have now stated its earliest possible date will be March next year - more than 12 months away.",
      "Some officials though are reluctant to pursue the charges against Maguire as they fear it has damaged the island's reputation and, as a result, harmed its tourism, reports The Sun. Maguire's shock arrest came way back in the summer of 2020 with no resolution yet found.",
      "A source has said: “Harry has — and always will — contest the charges. He was on holiday with friends and family and was understandably distraught. He doesn’t want this hanging over him another day but respects the Greek legal system.”",
      "Maguire was held by police and spent two nights behind bars after an altercation on a night out. Days later he was facing the courts with his lawyers given just two hours to prepare a case as crucial evidence was withheld from the trial. Maguire was found guilty of bodily harm, attempted bribery and violence.",
      "The United star got a suspended jail term of 21 months, but his lawyers immediately lodged an appeal, quashing the original verdict, and vowed to return to court to clear his name, which remains on the cards.",
      "The United star, who then was only a year into his Old Trafford career, maintained his innocence in an interview with the BBC and confessed he \"feared for his life\" when he was involved in a brawl. \"I don't feel I owe an apology to anybody,\" he said. \"An apology is something when you have done something wrong. I don't wish it (his situation) on anybody.",
      "\"Obviously the situation has made it difficult for one of the biggest clubs in the world, so I regret putting the fans and the club through this, but I did nothing wrong. I found myself in a situation where it could have happened to anybody and anywhere.\"",
      "Maguire stated that whilst he, his wife Fern, sister Daisy and six others waited for a taxi two Albanian men approached Daisy and tried to talk to her. Fern said she then saw Daisy’s eyes roll back as she drifted in and out of consciousness with Maguire claiming the group shouted at the men but there was no fight.",
      "Quizzed on how badly he was hurt the England international said: \"They hit me a lot on the legs. It wasn't on my mind. I was in that much of a panic. Fear. Scared for my life.\"",
      "He added: \"I know what happened that night. I know the truth. When I speak about it I get worked up but that's because it just makes me feel a bit angry inside. I will move on. I am mentally strong enough.\"",

      "Though he won the Europa League and FA Cup, it was ultimately a disappointing spell at Old Trafford for the Frenchman. But while fans and pundits may have been left underwhelmed, his team-mates remained fully supportive.",

      "\"He can be the best midfielder in the world. In terms of qualities, he has everything. I have never seen a midfielder who has all the qualities he can have. He can recover a lot of balls, he can head the ball, he can score goals, he can defend, he can attack, he's so strong and tall.",

      "Pogba had a difficult relationship with United fans, who grew impatient with his struggles. The midfielder opened up on those struggles after his departure, insisting the attitude of supporters had a negative impact on him.",
      "\"I just want the best for me,\" he told Uninterrupted in 2022. \"I'm thinking, putting everything together, taking my time, and I'm just looking for the best, I want to play football, be myself always, and enjoy what I do.",

      "\"It's always been like that, even adults need that. It's always good to feel the work you do is appreciated that you're doing well that people are happy with yourself. I like to talk to the people and be a leader but even a leader sometimes needs his teammates to be encouraged.\""

      "Bruno Fernandes headed to the Premier League back in 2020 and was given some advice by former team-mate Lucas Torreira before the Manchester United star hit the ground running",
      "Bruno Fernandes was warned by Lucas Torreira he would have to quickly adapt to the Premier League's physical nature before the Manchester United star went on to become an instant hit.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder moved to Old Trafford in the January transfer window back in 2020 for a hefty fee having impressed whilst at Sporting Lisbon. Before playing in his homeland Fernandes had also excelled in Italy with the likes of Udinese and Sampdoria.",
      "It was at the latter where he played alongside Torreira, who moved to Arsenal in the summer of 2018. The Uruguayan quickly became accustomed to the attritional nature of England's top flight and told his former team-mate he'd have to do likewise if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Torreira told Sky Sports: \"I really hope he adapts quickly, particularly as the Premier League is so physical and intense as a championship. I'm sure he has the right mentality to adapt quickly. Obviously, he's joining a big club in Manchester United so I hope he enjoys the move.\"",
      "Fernandes needn't have worried as he became an instant hit, inspiring a United side that had struggled under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The midfielder netted his first goal in a win over Watford, converting from the penalty spot which began his impressive run in front of goal.",
      "Despite joining midseason he scored 12 times as the Red Devils went unbeaten for the final 14 games of the season en route to a third-place finish. The year after, with Fernandes fully embedded in the English game, he went on to reach new heights.",
      "He scored 28 times in all competitions, his highest figure whilst at United, as Solskjaer's side rose to second in the league, even sitting top of the pile at one point. In his first year and a half in England, Fernandes was also named the Premier League's Player of the Month an astounding four times.",
      "Torreira meanwhile, despite beginning his Arsenal career in impressive fashion, began to struggle at the Emirates amid several managerial changes. In his first 18 months, he played under three different coaches - Unai Emery, Freddie Ljungberg and Mikel Arteta.",
      "His playing time gradually decreased and eventually, he moved away on loan, first to Atletico Madrid and then to Fiorentina, to ensure he could get minutes. Arsenal have since sold Torreira to Galatasaray and he helped the Turkish side secure a memorable win over United and Fernandes in the Champions League earlier this season."

    "date": "2024-02-11 06:00:00",
    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Federico Macheda is best remembered for scoring a stunning 93rd-minute winner on his Manchester United debut against Aston Villa in April 2009, but his career never lived up to the hype",
      "Manchester United have come from behind to level the scores at home to Aston Villa.",
      "The scoreline reads 2-2 and the Stretford End is baying for a late winner. Up steps a young striker, one without a single Premier League goal to his name. Now choose your hero: Rasmus Hojlund or Federico Macheda.",
      "Macheda's winner in April 2009, a skilful swivelling strike assisted by Ryan Giggs which flew past sprawling Villa goalkeeper Brad Friedel, is among of the most memorable late goals in Premier League history. The 17-year-old substitute incredibly marked his United debut with a 93rd-minute winner to steer Sir Alex Ferguson's side back on course for their third successive English title.",
      "As for Hojlund, his lethal strike to make it 3-2 at Old Trafford this past Boxing Day isn't quite as iconic, but the emotional outpour was a close similarity. Having bagged five strikes in six Champions League games, United's £72million signing from Atalanta agonisingly had to wait until his 15th top-flight appearance to finally score a goal, and he's now on a run of four goals in as many matches.",
      "That takes Hojlund just one shy of Macheda's overall tally for Premier League goals, as although he followed up his debut heroics with another winner the very next weekend away to Sunderland, his Red Devils career fizzled out.",
      "Hojlund's time at Old Trafford doesn't appear to be going that way, though. Nor does that of midfield starlet and academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, who also marked his breakthrough at United with a stunning added-time winner away to Wolves last Thursday; a mazy solo goal as opposed to Macheda's and Hojlund's sharp turns and emphatic finishes.",
      "So, what's Macheda up to now?",
      "Having left Old Trafford permanently in 2014 following a spate of misfiring loan spells, Macheda spent the next two years playing in the Championship with Cardiff and Nottingham Forest. Then home came calling, as in 2016 the Lazio academy product signed for Italian side Novara and bagged 11 goals across 52 appearances in another two-year stint.",
      "Next would be his longest stay at a club since his youth, as Macheda joined Panathinaikos and played for the Greek side for the next four seasons. His record of 40 goals in 116 games proved his innate goalscoring ability which Sir Alex Ferguson praised 15 years ago, having brought him to the club aged 17 in August 2008.",
      "\"Macheda has got something special about him, the boy,\" Ferguson remarked after the Italian's ice-cool finish up at Sunderland. \"He side-footed it as it came to him. It's that quick-thinking that goalscorers have got. He wasn't fazed by anything.\"",
      "Your turn! Is Federico Macheda's debut the best in Manchester United history? Give us your pick in the comments section.",
      "Judging by his career path, Macheda also isn't fazed on playing in front of intense crowds. His next stop came in 2022 when he joined newly-promoted Turkish outfit Ankaragucu. The former Italy youth international only scored once prior to the January transfer window, however, prompting a loan move to Apoel in Nicosia, Cyprus.",
      "Macheda only scored twice but after returning to the Turkish capital, this season has been better for the now 32-year-old. On Tuesday, he bagged his fourth goal of the campaign in a 5-1 cup victory over second-tier Erzincanspor.",
      "That game was a rare start for the Rome-born striker, with the Ankara-based side currently sitting 11th out of 20 in the Turkish Super Lig. His contract is due to expire this summer, so perhaps Macheda will be on the move again.",
      "Despite not living up to his early potential as a dynamic and physically imposing finisher, 'Kiko' will always have a place in United folklore. He has one regret, though, and if Macheda could turn back time, he might still be leading the line for the Red Devils to this day.",
      "\"I have regrets about not keeping working hard as before I got into the first team,\" he told the Vibe with FIVE podcast. \"When I got to the first-team, for me everything was amazing.",
      "\"But when you do well, your concentration drops. That doesn't allow you to keep working for something bigger, that was what was the missing thing for me - I didn't work for the next bigger thing at my time at Manchester United.",
      "\"If that is one regret I have it is this one because I should have done a lot more with the chances I had with the first-team when I had ten minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes or starts because I had a lot of them. For an 18-year-old it is not normal.",
      "\"I knew I was very good physically, my character was confident but I had to keep going in terms of wanting more. I was enjoying this moment yes too much but I didn't think it was easy because after those games [against Villa and Sunderland], I didn't have the chance to play every week.\"",
      "Hojlund and Mainoo - 21 and 18 respectively - don't have the same issue, as they've become nailed-on starters. The pair are expected to line up at Villa Park on Sunday, coincidently where Macheda netted another of his late goals in a United shirt."

      "NEIL MOXLEY: Until the structure is clearly defined at Manchester United as to who does what and whether the manager has a proper say in it, we'll never know if the Old Trafford chief is good, bad or indifferent",
      "Does anyone know if Erik ten Hag is a good football manager?",
      "‌Or if he's just bang average? He's fast approaching two years in the job and it’s difficult to gauge whether, if given the tools, he can turn Manchester United into a genuine force.",
      "On one hand, his first full season gathered pace like an Alpine avalanche after a horrible start, culminating in the Carabao Cup and a finish in the top four. On the other, his second has been limp.",
      "‌An awful Champions League campaign, stuttering return in the domestic league but still with a realistic shot at success in the FA Cup, it’s been more bad than good.",
      "All of which leaves the court of public opinion still in the jury room, deliberating whether this quietly-spoken Dutchman - something of a rarity in football - has the X-factor necessary to grab this behemoth and make a success of it.",
      "The fact is, all of us - punters, neutrals and professional observers like yours truly - haven’t been given all the evidence. We don’t know, for instance, what Ten Hag’s take is on the players he’s been given in the transfer market?",
      "‌We don’t know if they are recruits he coveted, or whether they’ve just been dumped at his door and he’s been told to get on with it. Perhaps it’s a failure of this profession to really dig down and nail if Rasmus Hojlund, for example, really was top of his wanted list.",
      "‌Why does that matter? It does because Ten Hag has an excuse to fail. He can point to those sat behind him in the shadows - as he did last week at Molineux - and say: \"I asked for a striker in the window - and you didn’t get me one.\"",
      "‌The Dutchman sat in his press conference after Kobbie Mainoo’s last-gasp goal stunned Molineux - annoyed and frustrated. The punchline was that he had no idea whatsoever who, if anyone, was going to be delivered.",
      "‌Which is strange, at a football club at which - you suppose - there should be joined up thinking. In fact, it’s clear that there isn’t any such thing.",
      "‌If Ten Hag's performance is to be measured - give him the responsibility and let's see if he fails. The picture hasn’t been made any clearer by the truly bizarre arrival of Jim Ratcliffe, Dave Brailsford or anyone else in their inner circle.",
      "‌I’ll be honest: From this viewpoint, the Glazers have played a blinder. They’ve recouped their initial outlay for the club by selling a share of it to Ratcliffe, yet still maintain overall control and divested themselves of any criticism in supporters’ eyes by off-loading the really tricky part - on-field matters - to someone else.",
      "‌Be that as it may, contrast this with his with what happens at Sunday's opponents Aston Villa. Unai Emery runs the place. Unai wanted Monchi, his former recruitment partner at Seville, to oversee transfers.",
      "‌That’s what happened. Unai wanted his own backroom staff. That’s what happened. What Unai wants, Unai gets. It was evident again this week as striker Leon Bailey was offered a new, long-term deal.",
      "‌Emery said: \"We discussed it about one month ago and decided to open talks.\" If he didn’t want it to happen, believe me, it wouldn’t. Villa’s owners haven’t got any more or less of a clue about football than Manchester United’s - although they made a good appointment in the Basque.",
      "‌Villa are, at present, over-achieving - and it’s going to be some effort if the second half of the season mirrors the first. But, as a club, they’re light years ahead of where they were. Why? Because Emery is in charge. He knows what he is doing.",
      "Even if he didn’t, the point is that he CAN be judged. Ten Hag can’t. Until the structure is clearly defined at Manchester United as to who does what and whether the manager has a proper say in it, we’ll never know if the Old Trafford chief is good, bad or indifferent. Let’s put it like this. Was anyone in any doubt who ran the show when Alex Ferguson was in charge? Case closed.",

      "Legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson stumbled into a number issues when attempting to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel during his time at Old Trafford",
      "Peter Schmeichel’s boots - or more accurately gloves - were certainly hard to fill for those that followed at Manchester United... as Mark Bosnich soon discovered.",
      "The Australian had two spells at Old Trafford during his career. He initially arrived in Manchester in 1989 after moving over from his home country. Bosnich made just three appearances before subsequent moves to Sydney United and Aston Villa.",
      "But he returned after impressing Sir Alex Ferguson while in the West Midlands, moving back to Old Trafford on a free transfer after legendary Dane Schmeichel called it a day. And Bosnich was in no doubt about returning.",
      "Speaking in 2022, Bosnich revealed: “After one conversation with Sir Alex Ferguson, I was pretty certain I was going to re-join United in 1999/2000. I was watching when they then went on to win the Champions League – I was especially delighted for my best friend, Dwight Yorke – and I signed a few days later, meaning that we had an appearance in the Intercontinental Cup final to come before the end of 1999.",
      "“When I joined, I definitely had a feeling of unfinished business with United. I’d been lucky enough to play three games for the club as a young player, but this time around I wanted to win trophies. United had just won the Treble, so where do you go from there? Well, you try to win it all again and become world champions too. There was so much for me to look forward to.",
      "“Coming back to United really did feel like coming home. We were still based at the Cliff for the first six months before we moved to Carrington, and I used to live five minutes’ walk away on Lower Broughton Road. It felt great to be back.”",
      "Unfortunately, it did not work out for Bosnich. Despite helping the Red Devils to the 1999/2000 Premier League title, he did not convince before being replaced by Fabian Barthez.",
      "Speaking about his time as a United player, Bosnich said: “It was very successful as was shown by winning two prestigious trophies in one year. I also had amazing experiences such as playing for the club in the Bernabeu as well as playing regularly at Old Trafford.",
      "“Although, it was disappointing that it ended the way that it did. I should have played there for much longer but such is life. That is the way things work out sometimes.”",
      "After just 18 months he moved to Premier League rivals Chelsea. His exit would be explosive. Upon making his switch to Stamford Bridge official, Bosnich penned a statement via his agent. He noticeably left Alex Ferguson out of his list of thanks.",
      "\"Mark is absolutely delighted to be joining Chelsea,\" said Bosnich's agent Steve Kutner. \"They are a very successful club with ambitions that mirror Mark's own.",
      "“At this time Mark does not wish to dwell on the past but only look towards a brighter future with Chelsea. Mark would like to thank the players, directors and supporters of Manchester United for the respect and friendship that they always showed him.”",
      "Bosnich did not make a single appearance for Chelsea during his debut campaign, while he accumulated just seven outings during the next season.",
      "In September 2002, Bosnich failed a drugs test for cocaine and he was banned from football for nine months. He was also forced to pay £10,000 to an FA commission.",
      "The ban saw Bosnich take a step back from the sport for around six years before eventually making a return in Australia with the Central Coast Mariners. Ferguson never became a fan after slamming the former goalkeeper as a “terrible professional” in his autobiography.",
      "Bosnich eventually hung up his gloves in 2009 - to far less fanfare than the man he had been unable to replace.",

      "Manchester United mounted a storming comeback to beat Aston Villa on Boxing Day in the reverse fixture, with the two now set to go head-to-head at Villa Park on Sunday",
      "Unai Emery has detailed Aston Villa to keep a close eye on two of Manchester United ’s unsung heroes.",
      "Villa’s boss has studied the Red Devils’ last two games and believes Erik ten Hag’s side is armed and dangerous. While he believes several of the Dutchman’s side are enjoying ‘good moments,’ he picked out a couple who he thinks have made a difference - Casemiro and keeper Andre Onana.",
      "‌And he asked one of his own to do a job on the Spanish midfielder. He said: “I need to understand their game plan and qualities - trying to stop them from the goalkeeper onwards because his build-up is fantastic.",
      "‌“ Luke Shaw is very dangerous and Diogo Dalot is in a good moment. Their wingers are very good. They have a good striker. But they are recovering with Casemiro.",
      "‌“He’s a stopper. He recovers a lot of balls with his position, defensively. He gives them balance with and without the ball. If we are thinking about our important players with those qualities, it would be Boubacar Kamara .",
      "‌“But Casemiro is important for them and they have improved with his comeback and the confidence he is giving the other players when they are playing, allowing them to be offensive, and attack.",
      "‌“They can do that when they have a player like Casemiro behind them and covering them. For set-pieces also, he’s a very important player. He’s scoring goals and he defends set-pieces as well.”",
      "‌Asked if it was a proper match-up in midfield with Villa’s Brazil international Douglas Luiz and Kamara, Emery replied: “Yes, but they also have (Kobbie) Mainoo, (Scott) McTominay and (Christian) Eriksen - all good players.”",
      "‌Emery elaborated on why he rates Onana as a key member of the United system, saying that he is still adjusting to English football: “He’s a very good goalkeeper.",
      "‌“The coach knew him from before. When he signed this keeper, it’s because he believed in his potential to adapt here in the Premier League.",
      "‌“That’s not easy for any player. With some - and we have cases here as well like Moussa Diaby - you are trying to support them, give them confidence. It’s a process. I think with Onana, it could be the same. His skills allow them to be better.”",
      "‌Emery billed this dust-up as a ‘six-pointer’ at his press briefing and was asked if he would settle for a point to maintain the gap between the two. He replied: “No, not at the beginning. We have to try to get the three points.",
      "‌“We have to play an intelligent match. And I have a strong belief we can respond after Chelsea. We have to prepare for every detail. That’s why I’m reaching out to the supporters for their help - because we will need them.”",

      "He has hardly set the world alight since his switch to the Camp Nou in 2019, but that would have been difficult considering the number of obstacles the club has faced on and off the pitch in that time. Regardless, in the past De Jong has pledged his loyalty to Barcelona.",

However, the couple are among a number of fans who have been relocated, with Mrs Whiteside claiming the move is so that United can expand executive seating - a claim the club denies.",
      "Taking to social media, she posted an image of her husband's seat and wrote: \"So, it doesn't matter how long you've been a loyal supporter, doesn't matter if you played for your club, @ManUtd can just dump you from your seat when they feel like it, so they can expand exec seating! Absolute disgrace!",
      "\"I’d like to make clear that this post is not just about Norman. There are a whole block of loyal supporters who expressed their views to me at the West Ham game, but they feel as if they have no voice or platform to voice their anger.\"",
      "The club have since responded, insisting they are not actually expanding hospitality and are \"committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground\".",
      "A spokesperson said:“We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations. These happen for various reasons, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders — in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "However, when responding to other United fans on social media, Mrs Whiteside made it clear it was the fact they were not being given a choice in the matter which was the problem. \"It's not just about Norman, many of the 'United family' we sit with have been in that block for 20-30+ years, and are all really angry about this ENFORCED seat relocation.",
      "\"At a time when the football has been less than spectacular and the season ticket price is increasing!\" Replying to another fan, she added: \"There are so many of us who have supported United together in that block who are angry as hell, and it looks like we count for nothing\".",

      "Villa, on the other hand, have taken huge scalps this season beating top four rivals, Spurs, City, and Liverpool. It’s been a fantastic season for the Villans, full of attacking intent and a fearlessness seldom seen in the Premier League.",
      "But this game has some history. United came back from two down to beat them in the last meeting in December - will Unai Emery’s men get their revenge?",
      "Despite back-to-back wins in the league, United still hold a negative goal difference. 31 scored and 32 conceded is nowhere near the stats posted by their rivals, but, with a win, they will somehow find themselves with an outside shot at the top four.",
      "One massive positive is the clicking of their front three, especially Rasmus Højlund. Unable to buy a goal for love nor money, he now has four in his last five, as does Alejandro Garnacho, while Marcus Rashford has three. If the trio can keep this form up, there could be something special coming at Old Trafford.",
      "Villa smashed five past Sheffield United last time out, but conceded three to Newcastle the week before, and let in four to Chelsea in the FA Cup in midweek. Those are rather troubling signs for Unai Emery, but ones Erik ten Hag will no doubt exploit.",
      "This one could be a battle of the form book, but I wouldn’t rule out Villa at home - they’ve lost just once there in the league all season. 2-1 Villa.",
      "How are both teams expected to line up on Sunday? Here are the predicted lineups from WhoScored.com with all the relevant team news.",
      "Martinez; Cash, Carlos, Lenglet, Moreno; McGinn, Luiz, Kamara, Bailey; Diaby, Watkins",
      "Onana; Dalot, Varane, Maguire, Shaw; Mainoo, Casemiro; Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford; Hojlund",
      "The hosts look set to be without no fewer than five players through injury.",
      "Moussa Diaby could come in for a start here, after scoring from the bench in the FA Cup defeat to Chelsea in midweek.",
      "Lisandro Martinez has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a knee injury.",
      "United will remain without the injured Anthony Martial, Tyrell Malacia, Mason Mount and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "Villa are 23/20 for a home win with Ladbrokes, while United are at 2/1. A draw, which is very much a possibility in this one, pays a best price 14/5.",
      "Given his sparkling recent form, Rasmus Højlund at 5/2 to score anytime on Ladbrokes (7/1 to score first) looks like a good shout, particularly as part of a bet builder.",
      "However, Villa’s Ollie Watkins might be your preferred choice - he’s the only player in the Premier League with double figures for goals and assists - he is 5/1 to score first and 8/5 to score anytime.",

      "Federico Macheda, who scored an iconic goal on his Man Utd debut at Old Trafford, is against knocking the decaying stadium down and wants new owners to renovate rather than bulldoze",
      "Forgotten Manchester United striker Federico Macheda is urging the club not to bulldoze Old Trafford and create a new stadium.",
      "The Italian, who scored a famous last gasp winner at the ground to beat Aston Villa on his debut, is in agreement with the majority who think the ground is in need of upgrading.",
      "But he says any decision that would see it flattened will mean a large part of the club’s soul and history is lost.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose 25 per cent purchase of the club is nearing completion, has plans to make United’s stadium the “Wembley of the north” according to reports.",
      "He has already vowed to invest huge sums in improving the club’s infrastructure, although it remains unclear whether a new ground will be built from scratch or the existing stadium will be renovated.",
      "Old Trafford remains the country’s biggest club arena but it has issues with leaking roofs, a problem with rodent infestation and last received a major upgrade more than a decade ago.",
      "And in an interview with the Daily Mail, Macheda says: “I would be against destroying the stadium and building it somewhere else. I believe the structure and the history of the place should stay there, and then make some improvements.",
      "“Even if you build next to it – and I’m sure they would make it an amazing stadium – it’s a place where all the fans enjoyed great games and memories. The first day I signed for Manchester United when I was a kid, walking inside the stadium gave me a special feeling. I’d never seen something like it. It’s magical.",
      "“It’s not only the place where I scored the goal, it’s home for everybody who supports United. When I went back, it was the same. Obviously, it needs to be upgraded but the history of this club is also this stadium, Old Trafford.”",
      "Macheda failed to make a sustained breakthrough under Sir Alex Ferguson at United and was sent out on loan to six different clubs before moving on in 2014.",
      "Now 32, he has also played for Cardiff and Nottingham Forest but has spent recent years plying his trade in Turkey and Cyprus.",
      "But it is his debut goal against Villa as a 17-year-old, ensuring United's charge to the 2008 Premier League remained on track, that will go down as the most iconic moment of his career.",

      "A number of fans and Man United great Norman Whiteside have been affected by a club decision on season tickets.",
      "Manchester United great Norman Whiteside and a number of supporters have been angered by the club's decision to relocate their season ticket seats at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside joined United as a teenager in 1978 before breaking into the first team. He scored 67 goals in 274 games in a red shirt before departing for Everton in 1989.",
      "The Northern Irishman became the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals during his time at the club. Whiteside also became the youngest to play in a World Cup, breaking Pele's record when representing his nation aged just 17 years and 40 days.",
      "Whiteside's career ended at the age of 26 due to injury, but he is still remembered fondly by fans for his contribution and his match-winning goal against Everton in the 1985 FA Cup final.",
      "The 58-year-old is considered a United great, but that hasn't stopped him from being affected by a decision to relocate season ticket holders in block S122 at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside is a platinum season ticket holder, which means he's held his ticket for over 25 years, and his name on his seat, but he now faces the prospect of being moved.",
      "He is not alone and hundreds of other fans have been affected by the decision. Whiteside's wife, Dee, wrote on social media: \"So, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve been a loyal supporter, doesn’t matter if you played for your club, United can just dump you from your seat when they feel like it, so they can expand exec seating. Absolute disgrace.\"",
      "She continued: \"I’d like to make clear that this post is not just about Norman. There are a whole block of loyal supporters who expressed their views to me at the West Ham game, but they feel as if they have no voice or platform to voice their anger.",
      "\"It’s not just about Norman, many of the 'United family' we sit with have been in that block for 20-30+ years, and are all really angry about this ENFORCED seat relocation. At a time when the football has been less than spectacular and the season ticket price is increasing.\"",
      "The Manchester Evening News contacted United for comment and a spokesperson said: “We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders — in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "Before that statement was made, a season ticket holder told the MEN: \"I've sent an email and made three calls, but we've had little reassurance of where we will be moved to.",
      "\"I’m 52, my son is 19, we could move to another part of the ground. However, there are many older fans around us who have had their seat for decades and they have many friends around them.",
      "\"I think the club is underestimating the effect this could have on some of the fans and their mental health and welfare. I doubt many could handle the stairs in other parts of the ground.\"",
      "Club sources have previously insisted they empathise with fans in such scenarios, while also indicating relocations within Old Trafford are often deemed necessary by staff.",

      "Unai Emery has Aston Villa flying in the Premier League and challenging for Champions League qualification but a weakness in his side has emerged over the last two months.",
      "Emery prefers his teams to play with a high defensive line in an attempt to defend away from the goal and he's stuck by those principles, despite Pau Torres being unavailable.",
      "Torres is a pacy defender and he's a key cog in the system, but he sustained an ankle injury in December and Villa have suffered, losing twice (against Manchester United and Newcastle) and drawing two times (Sheffield United and Everton) in the last six league games.",
      "The Spaniard briefly made a return from the bench during that run of games but that came too soon in his recovery. Torres has a chance of making the matchday squad when his side welcome United to Villa Park on Sunday afternoon but it's highly unlikely he will start the game.",
      "Ezri Konsa and Clement Lenglet have started in Torres' absence and they are set to play again, which is good news for a United attacking front three that isn't short of pace.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho have developed an understanding in recent weeks and they will find plenty of space behind Villa's defensive line to target.",
      "At Old Trafford during the festive period, Villa had a two-goal lead against United at half-time, but they crumbled in the second half and lost the game 3-2 after a spirited comeback.",
      "Garnacho scored a brace and Hojlund scored his first league goal. The pace of Garnacho caused havoc and Emery, speaking after the match, said his team needed to have more control and eradicate mistakes. He also described the contest as a 'missed opportunity'.",
      "Villa's collapse on Boxing Day will serve as extra motivation this weekend, although Emery's tactics will not change and that should play into the hands of Erik ten Hag.",
      "Ten Hag has said he wants United to be 'the best transition team in the world' and that approach will be used on Sunday, with Villa playing high and likely to have the majority of possession.",
      "There have been accusations of a lack of a style of play levelled at Ten Hag this season, but now he has close to a fully-fit squad, how he wants to play is becoming clearer.",
      "United have the pace and quality to hurt Villa on the counter-attack and they will find joy in the wide areas in such scenarios, meaning Rashford and Garnacho will have a key role to play.",
      "Since Torres has been injured, Villa have shipped three goals against United and Newcastle, while conceding twice against Burnley. Their defensive line is gettable and should be exposed.",
      "There have been countless moments over the last few weeks when the opposition has sent a ball over the heads of Konsa and Lenglet, which has led to the pair scrambling backwards.",
      "Lenglet is considered the weak link and he was also vulnerable when on loan at Tottenham last season. Obviously, Barcelona do not allow quality players to leave on loan.",
      "It's taken six months, but United's attackers head into this match in excellent form and it would be a surprise if one of those players didn't find the back of the net against Villa. Hojlund has four goals in his last four appearances and there should be no problem providing him with service.",
      "Naturally, the players will have been briefed on Villa's high line at Carrington this week and players like Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo will be important in playing the killer pass.",

      "They would do so in the season-opening Super Cup, but once again, they would finish runners-up to Bayern in both the Bundesliga and the German Cup.",
      "It hadn't put United off, though. Moyes was sacked after 10 months in charge, and Klopp was quickly made a favourite for the job along with Netherlands coach Louis Van Gaal, Atletico Madrid's manager Diego Simeone, and Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc.",
      "United inquired about the possibility of attaining his services again, but were told Klopp was insistent on honouring his contract at Signal Iduna Park.",
      "Even before they had parted ways with Moyes, then executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward had flown out to meet with Klopp in an effort to convince him to take over at United. It didn't work.",
      "“David Moyes’ short tenure at Old Trafford was coming to an end, and Klopp was United’s favourite to replace him, to bring back a sense of adventure to the Red Devils’ game,” Raphael Honigstein wrote in his biography on Jurgen Klopp called ‘Bring the Noise’.",
      "“Woodward told Klopp that the Theatre of Dreams was ‘like an adult version of Disneyland’, a mythical place where, as the nickname suggested, the entertainment was world-class and dreams came true. Klopp wasn’t entirely convinced by that sales pitch—he found it a bit ‘unsexy’, he told a friend—but he didn’t dismiss the proposition out of hand either.”",
      "United still hoped they could lure Klopp to Manchester, but the more he thought about it, the more he longed to end his time at Dortmund on a high.",
      "\"Man United is a great club and I feel very familiar with their wonderful fans,\" he said shortly afterwards. \"But my commitment to Borussia Dortmund and the people is not breakable.\"",

      "FROM 2022: 'Fernandes and Eriksen were both laughing' - the new mood at United's training complex",
      "The message is clear: all five academy graduates - goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, winger and forward - have represented their countries and played regularly in the Premier League. All five drive through the Carrington barriers daily.",
      "The photographs are married with monochrome shots of Manchester Town Hall and the city skyline. \"We've spent so much time trying to reconnect everybody back to Manchester,\" Cox explains, \"to our history but also to the city.\"",
      "United have held academy staff meetings at the Museum of Science and Industry and invited folk from the city to present to them. Tony Walsh, a lifelong United fan who uttered the immortal This Is The Place poem days after the Manchester Arena attack, struck a chord. \"It's the balance of a global brand but still feeling like an intimate family,\" Cox explains.",
      "Inside the new academy gym, goalkeeper Tom Wooster is lifting weights with a coach, Shola Shoretire, Ashton Missin and Malachi Sharpe are loosening up on an exercise bike, preparing to brace the lashing rain.",
      "When we eventually leave the £9million extension, four sodden and muddied lads are removing their boots after a morning training session. The doors to the new building opened in October, 20 years after the dedicated academy centre was opened by Sirs Alex Ferguson and Bobby Charlton.",
      "The latest addition is part of the one-club approach, with the women's team also housed on the premises. Before construction started, the exterior of the original academy building was graced by a timeline of graduates from the men's and women's teams, starting with Busby Babes captain Roger Byrne and ending with women's captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cox has been the United academy head since 2019 and has overseen an exceptional period, even by the dream factory's standards. United have passed 4,000 consecutive matches with an academy member in a matchday squad, 22 have debuted for the first team, with Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo already indispensable.",
      "The pair were totemic during the FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022, an uplifting run in an unedifying season. Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalls his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside.",
      "Mainoo hails from Stockport and Brexit has forced United to look more intensely within their borders as they cannot recruit overseas talents aged under 18. That is a challenge the club have embraced and they have a precedent for blending homegrown British talent with continental clout.",
      "\"Think of the best United teams, the best United youth teams,\" Cox begins. \"It's always been a core of local boys who understand the club, understand the city, what it means to the local people and then elite incomers, the best around, who bring innovation and maybe a different slant on things.",
      "\"I remember talking to Nicky Butt. He and the lads showed Ronaldo or Eric Cantona the club and they said, 'By the way, this is what I eat and I go and train twice a day.' So the lads were like, we'll follow suit.",
      "\"And that goes back to youth teams that would've had Bobby Charlton in it, arriving not from Manchester, or George Best, David Beckham, or Paul Pogba or whether it's Alejandro Garnacho. That's a bit of an unofficial blend.",
      "\"It's become a bit harder post-Brexit but our talent pool now is very much a UK talent pool, it changes the challenge a little bit but the concept is still the same. How do you make sure you've exhausted local talent?",
      "\"This place has to provide opportunities for local players, first and foremost, we've got to give everyone the chance. But then how do we add from further afield to make sure we've got a pool of high-potential talent that has to go and support a winning first team? That's the challenge.\"",
      "United arranged flexible deadline day loans for Wooster, Sam Murray, Sam Mather and Sonny Aljofree to support local non-league clubs Macclesfield, Rochdale and Altrincham. Murray is one of the youngsters drying off downstairs while Mather and Aljofree have both been involved in first-team training sessions this month.",
      "Cox has always downplayed the presence of unknown quantities suddenly rubbing shoulders with first-teamers in club imagery and footage. \"It's always been commonplace but even more so under this manager, our boys will be in and around to support first-team training,\" he reiterates.",
      "\"There are probably two versions of support he needs. The academy provides two services: the academy has got to develop players who can play in that team and the other is to support that team to prepare to win.",
      "\"So recovery days, maybe when the manager's got a smaller group, we will add to that smaller group so they can have a proper, functional training session. So anyone who's not played, say there are eight remaining players, plus our 10 to make a training group so they can have a high-level functional session.",
      "\"But then on a normal training day there'll still be three, four or five lads over there. Some on merit, some just because it's the right positional fit. And the challenge for the boys is to really make a name for themselves. That jump to the first team.",
      "\"Everyone asks me, 'How do you decide? When do you decide?' There's never a day, there's always this movement back.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag is prompt on providing feedback. \"Darren Fletcher (technical director) is the biggest conduit, really,\" Cox stresses. \"He is unbelievable at managing that period where they have one foot in each camp and then me and my staff are providing feedback as well.",
      "\"John Murtough is involved in there. There's this ongoing regular discussion around where they are at, what help do they need, what does the next month look like.\"",
      "The academy is approaching another milestone. After Omari Forson's cameo against Wigan Athletic in last month's FA Cup third-round win, United are on 249 academy graduates to have played for the first team. Joe Hugill was an unused substitute that evening and has since joined Burton Albion on loan.",
      "Willy Kambwala was an unlikely presence in the starting XI at West Ham United two days before Christmas. Such unexpected promotions are the beauty of United's faith in youth.",
      "\"Every debut brings us great pride,\" Cox beams. \"As a youth developer, I take great pride from a number of sources about kids being successful.",
      "\"Debuts are obviously a more public-facing event that brings great satisfaction and noise and brings external interest. It’s amazing when young people debut here because when they come here that is what they set out to do.",
      "\"I enjoyed watching the debuts this year – Willy, Dan Gore, Omari – it’s great to see kids make debuts. We should definitely celebrate it and it is a landmark that they will remember forever.",
      "\"But it really is the beginning of the new journey. Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it. We have seen many kids at this club make one appearance and no more, and for them, they are focused and determined, driven. They know it’s a nice moment but they want to be in the team next week. They want to be in the team.",
      "\"They want to get to where Alejandro’s at. He has been in and around the squad. But now he is about to make his 20th consecutive appearance. That is when you start to think okay, 20 games in a row, that’s something. I am now starting to establish myself.",
      "\"249 is a really nice statistic because it encapsulates the great work of a number of amazing people over 90-odd years. That first debut was 1931, so all of those debuts leading us to this point, I think the beauty of that is that it’s not fabricated, it’s not forced, it’s just organic, and only recently have we just established that it’s 249.",
      "\"This club gives young people opportunities and puts players in the team. 249 is lovely. 250. Who will it be? That is the beauty of my job. We have a number of high-potential players. Knowing which one it might be next is harder but I am looking forward to seeing now how Kobbie has developed.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is having a breakthrough season at Man Utd and he has been taken under Casemiro's wing since the Brazilian returned from injury.",
      "When Casemiro won his first Champions League title, Kobbie Mainoo was a nine-year-old pupil at Cheadle Catholic Junior School who had just embarked on his tentative first steps to a career in football.",
      "Mainoo joined Manchester United that year, but back then making it into the first team at Old Trafford was a pipe dream, a fantasy that became reality for barely a handful of boys. But the prodigious midfielder has always had the game and the character to make an impression and by his teenage years, he was earmarked as someone who had more than a fair chance.",
      "That progression has accelerated under Erik ten Hag this season. Mainoo caught the eye of the United manager in pre-season and although his progress was curtailed by an ankle injury, he was immediately restored to the senior set-up when he returned and has now started nine games in a row.",
      "The last three of them have been alongside Casemiro, a five-times Champions League winner and 75-cap Brazil international who knows a thing or two about making it to the top of the game as a midfield player. The 31-year-old has taken his teammate 13 years his junior under his wing and it is a partnership that is showing signs of promise.",
      "But if Casemiro has become Mainoo's minder at United, it is the younger man whose energy is bringing balance to United's midfield, making the former Real Madrid holding midfielder look much better than he did before suffering his own injury in November. The teenager from Stockport and the experienced midfielder from Sao Paulo are dovetailing on and off the pitch.",
      "\"Kobbie is very coachable, Casemiro has so much experience and Kobie will learn a lot from him and that can accelerate his development,\" he said.",
      "“When they play together I think they can take benefit from each other.",
      "“Casemiro takes that responsibility, he takes it to him, he is talking to him, I see it in the dressing room, I see it on the pitch in games, I see it in training.",
      "“Of course he looking at his own game but he’s trying to help and support Kobbie. Absolutely there is that bond (between them).\"",
      "Casemiro struggled early in this season and speculation over a move away from Old Trafford intensified, with the midfielder still having three years remaining on a sizeable contract at the end of this season, but his performances since returning to the side have suggested he can remain a major influence on Ten Hag's team.",
      "“He gives you calmness and composure on the ball, he gives you options, he sees the critical pass, so he is always a step ahead of his opponent to break lines,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"So he is a very important player for our game and we’re happy he’s back.\"",
      "Mainoo's emergence at United has been particularly impressive, given he has come into a team that was struggling for form and confidence.",
      "He played in the first game of the pre-season tour of the United States, impressing in midfield against a strong Arsenal side, and then started against Real Madrid in Houston only to pick up his injury in a tackle with Rodrygo in the early stages of that game.",
      "As soon as he returned to fitness he was back in the team, starting at Goodison Park in November at a time when United's season was on the rocks and immediately adding an injection of energy and quality to the centre of the pitch. United have won six of the 11 games Mainoo has started this season, but lost 11 of the 22 he's not.",
      "“It is more easy to integrate young talent into a successful team. That’s true,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "“The conditions where we had to bring in Kobbie Mainoo were not so good that we knew beforehand that it would be a success. I had the confidence because I saw him performing and progressing in spring and summer.",
      "“When I brought him in for the game against Arsenal, I didn’t have any doubts. But when he comes into the team there are many things he has to do on his own because when there are a lot of routines in the team it is much easier for him to come in.",
      "“But we were not in that situation - and I don’t think this club has been in that situation for a long time.",
      "“For many years, United have not been in that (successful) position, so we are building a team that can offer a foundation for young players to come in.",
      "“We have to have a foundation so that we can add quality players to the squad to take the team to the next level.”",
      "Although Mainoo has now started every game since the trip to Anfield on December 17, Ten Hag is treating him with care, withdrawing him at half-time at Nottingham Forest in the final game of 2023 and taking him off after 64 minutes against West Ham last weekend.",
      "“I took him out on Sunday because it was the second game in nearly three days,\" he said. “I brought him out against Nottingham Forest because it was the third game in a week.",
      "“I have to protect the player because first he has to get used to the Premier League intensity and then he has to get used to doing in every third day.",
      "“You can’t train that. It’s impossible. You can’t train it in the Under-21s. You can only train this in the Premier League and the Champions League when you play every third day.",
      "“That means you have to make considerations. It’s about the team - but it’s also about protecting young players so they don’t get injured.",
      "“Kobbie was injured twice and we don’t want that situation again because it stops his progress.\"",

      "Man Utd have pushed their way back into contention for Champions League football next season and they need the revenues that come with that competition.",
      "Erik ten Hag admits he doesn't know how significant the impact will be on his transfer budget if Manchester United fail to qualify for next season's Champions League, but said the club will have more \"financial power\" if they do secure a return to the top table of European football.",
      "United crashed out of Europe entirely before Christmas this season and face an uphill battle to secure a second successive season of Champions League football, with Sunday's trip to Villa Park pivotal in their fight to get back in the race for a top-four finish.",
      "Fifth could yet be good enough for Champions League football if the Premier League finishes the season as one of the two top-performing leagues in Europe, but Ten Hag's side are six points behind Tottenham, who currently sit fifth, and eight points adrift of Aston Villa in fourth.",
      "A run of 10 points from a possible 15 in the Premier League has put United back in the battle, but qualifying for the Champions League is no longer imperative solely for the prestige, but for the revenue it delivers as well at a time when clubs are struggling with the Premier League's stringent Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United are particularly close to the limit of losses allowed by the league over three years and their failure to stay in Europe into the New Year this season pushed them closer to the precipice, with Ten Hag enduring his own dry January in the transfer market as a result. He admitted that he had looked to sign a striker on loan during the window but that there was no wriggle room at all to do any business.",
      "That makes securing another year of Champions League cash vital ahead of Ineos' first summer transfer window in charge of United's football operations. They are set to appoint a new sporting director in time for the window, but if the season finishes with qualification for the Europa League or Europa Conference League, it will significantly reduce their ability to strengthen Ten Hag's squad.",
      "\"It’s very important to play Champions League, that is clear, we don’t have to discuss this,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"What exactly is the impact, that is what in this moment I don’t know, You have more financial power when you achieve the Champions League and that is our target, absolutely.\"",
      "According to the Football Coefficient website, the prize money in the Champions League this season totals just over €2bn, while the Europa League prize money is €465m and the Europa Conference League just €235m. That is before the difference in matchday revenue and broadcast income is considered, with both substantially higher in the Champions League.",
      "If United win at Villa Park on Sunday then they will close the gap to Unai Emery's side to five points. They have beaten top-half rivals Wolves and West Ham recently and earned a creditable draw at Old Trafford against Tottenham.",
      "In his press conference ahead of the trip to the Midlands, Ten Hag said he had told his team at the start of January that every game was now equivalent to a cup final as United seek to close the gap to the teams above them.",
      "\"I said to the team from the start of January every game is now a final,\" he said. \"That was also our approach to West Ham, this is a final, we have to take this challenge and see it as a final. That will be every day now from on.\"",

      "Manchester United have a crucial decision to make over whether to stick or twist with Old Trafford - and a new stadium could open up lucrative options for naming rights",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe reportedly wanting to create a ‘Wembley of the North’ for Manchester United, there is some discussion over what that should look like.",
      "Old Trafford has been United’s home since 1910, and while it may look a lot different now than it did then, it is nonetheless woven into the fabric of the football club, the scene of some of its greatest triumphs. But there is an awkward conversation to be had over whether sense trumps sentimentality, and whether or not the club chooses to spend money on redeveloping their existing home or start afresh on land adjacent, focusing on creating a world-class stadium for a club that wants to be at the vanguard of the game moving into a new era.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur had a key decision to make when it came to White Hart Lane: remained wedded to tradition or start afresh. They chose the latter and what they now have is a £1bn stadium, one of the world’s state-of-the-art sporting venues, where everything is designed to generate revenue beyond a matchday: from the contract that exists with the NFL to stage regular season games - with the retractable pitch all but confirming the stadium as the long-term home for the NFL in the UK, a market it could land a franchise in further on down the line - to the F1 Karting Experience that now exists underneath the stadium.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was debt-financed, but there is good debt and there is bad debt. If a business can service that debt and it doesn’t impede the growth of the business, with the debt used to grow revenues into the future, there is little to be concerned about. That can be seen through Spurs having the best position when it came to the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) due to investment in infrastructure being an allowable loss when it came to the £105m three-year loss limit.",
      "It is an investment that positions Spurs perfectly to take advantage of the trajectory of the modern game, and one that will likely see them emerge as a force over the next decade or so due to their ability to spend sustainably. They still have one ace left up their sleeve, too.",
      "The ground is still called the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after nothing came of exploratory naming rights talks with some major blue-chip firms. There is no firm decision on whether or not they will go down that route, and whether the identity of the club in the stadium name is worth foregoing the selling of rights.",
      "United will have that consideration too, should they decide to press the reset button and pursue a purpose-built stadium where they can plan down to the finest detail how it would benefit the club to the maximum. A new stadium, in the long run, would likely be the most cost-effective, and redeveloping the land around it would afford the club the chance to create an entertainment hub that would see it in use all year round.",
      "It would also allow them to sidestep the awkward issue of naming rights, something that can be of tremendous value to clubs, providing long-term financial security that emboldens spending. At present, there is very little chance of United renaming Old Trafford as it is. The backlash would be beyond intense. The same could be said if Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group decided to rename Anfield. It is a revenue stream that could exist, but one that won’t.",
      "A new stadium unbinds tradition and attachment and allows for commercial arms of clubs to greater monetise the premises in which these clubs operate. While that may seem a rather bleak way of looking at football tradition, the fact is that we are now through the looking glass when it comes to how the intersection of money and football come together. You can’t have the big signings on the big wages without the big cheques arriving through the door.",
      "North American sport has capitalised on naming rights opportunities in recent years. While certain teams who have remained in their storied stadiums, such as the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, have remained loyal to tradition, others with new venues have sought to make the most of the riches on offer. The Glazer-owned Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL team sold their stadium naming rights for a new stadium built in 1998 to a financial services firm, Raymond James. That deal is still in place and has been renewed until 2028, so there is some form from the United owners for doing such a deal.",
      "In Los Angeles, last year saw the biggest stadium naming rights deal in sporting history when the newly-built stadium for the Chargers and Rams was christened the So-Fi Stadium after the finance firm acquired the rights in a 30-year, $625m (£496m) deal. Given that deal was struck in 2019, and the size of United, more than £500m for their rights would be a very conservative estimate over the same period.",
      "Brands want naming rights for new stadia, and the amount they are willing to pay keeps on climbing. Manchester United is one of the sport’s most recognisable brands globally, and a best-in-class stadium would attract enormous interest from major companies wanting to attach themselves to the United brand. Deals of such longevity also provide owners with greater security over finance, in the same way that longer broadcast deals do.",
      "Whether or not United choose to go down the route of redevelopment or a new development remains to be seen, and it won’t be a swift process to reach a conclusion. There are greater financial benefits to be realised by breaking from tradition, but given that the game feels like it is battling for its soul more now than at any stage in the past, fans may feel it is a bridge too far.",

      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 24 and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.",
      "We predict that the hosts could line up in a 4-4-2 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Martinez; Cash, Carlos, Lenglet, Moreno; McGinn, Luiz, Kamara, Bailey; Diaby, Watkins.",
      "We predict that United could set up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their line-up as follows: Onana; Dalot, Varane, Maguire, Shaw; Casemiro, Mainoo, Fernandes; Garnacho, Hojlund, Rashford.",
      "The opening 30 minutes at Villa Park saw the possession and chances split evenly between the two sides, with Moussa Diaby coming closest when he forced Andre Onana into a fantastic save one-on-one. United were a constant threat on the counter, and just before the break, Ten Hag's side were able to snatch the lead.",
      "As Boubacar Kamara and Douglas Luiz exchanged passes in midfield, pressure from Kobbie Mainoo forced them into giving up possession, with Bruno Fernandes on the scene to pick up the loose ball. A fantastic through ball sent Rasmus Hojlund one-on-one, and Emiliano Martinez was wrong-footed as the striker slotted home to make it 1-0.",
      "United were the better side after the restart, and Diogo Dalot should've made it 2-0 in the 67th minute when he burst through on goal and rattled the post from a dangerous position. The pressure continued to build, and Ten Hag's side were able to secure the victory in the 84th minute as they doubled their lead.",
      "United picked up four consecutive corners late on, with the visitors forcing Martinez into making big saves from each set piece. There was nothing the 'keeper could do for the goal, with Harry Maguire leaping highest to guide his header into the bottom corner for 2-0.",
      "What do you think the final score will be? Let us know in the comments!",

      "It's the January transfer window once again, but despite United's indifferent start to the season, it remains to be seen whether they'll be able to bring any new players to Old Trafford this month. While the emphasis this January is on outgoings, with several players set to be sold or loaned out, there remains a possibility of a loan signing or two before February arrives.",

      "Having played for Man United, Daniel Nardiello achieved something special in his career. During his time at Old Trafford, he worked alongside club legends such as Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville and Roy Keane - who were all key in his development.",
      "Not many people can say they have played for Manchester United. For those that can, whether you played 963 times like Ryan Giggs, or once like Kieran Lee, the honour of pulling on the famous shirt is exactly the same.",
      "Daniel Nardiello managed four matches. The forward burst onto the scene with Wolves and played for the FA's School of Excellence at Lilleshall at the age of 14. Having impressed for his club, it wasn't a surprise when rival teams started to show an interest in him - and when United came calling, it was difficult to ignore.",
      "United were winning trophies for fun at that time, but Sir Alex Ferguson was always keen for the academy to strengthen and improve with emerging talent. The Reds were one of several sides interested in Nardiello, but the lure of one day playing under the lights at Old Trafford - for the most famous manager in world football - was just too special to turn down.",
      "OPINION: £72m signing might stop United making club-record summer move",
      "With Nardiello registered under schoolboy terms at Wolves, a Football League Appeals Committee ordered United to pay £200,000 compensation for his services, including other potential add-ons. On the pitch, meanwhile, it didn't take the frontman too long to progress through the ranks with the Reds, and he turned professional in October 1999.",
      "Despite having to wait more than a year to make his debut, it finally came in November 2001. It was in a 4-0 League Cup defeat at Arsenal - as part of a much-changed United side - but for Nardiello, it was an understandably proud moment.",
      "\"Don't get me wrong, looking back at it now, from a 40-year-old's perspective, it's something I'm extremely proud of that I managed to do, not many people manage to pull on that shirt and represent Manchester United's first team\", Nardiello told the Manchester Evening News. \"So it's something I look back on with real pride.",
      "\"At the time, I was an 18-year-old kid and you sort of just take it in your stride at that age, so I didn't really realise the achievement of playing for Manchester United's first team until my older age and when I retired.",
      "\"I was a confident young lad and I had confidence in myself to be playing football at the highest level, so it [his debut] just seemed like the next step in my development, and to do it at Arsenal at Highbury is something I am really proud of and something I am glad I wasn't nervous about at the time.\"",
      "When he was coming through at United, Nardiello was training alongside the likes of Roy Keane, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand. It was a time when the Reds were winning trophies consistently, so it is somewhat unsurprising that he had to wait a while - more than a year, to be precise - to make his second appearance for the club.",
      "Nardiello was working with some of the best footballers in the country, and it was their commitment to winning and attention to detail that was so impressive. Keane, in particular, was someone who the United youngster admired. The Irishman, as is well documented, was desperate to succeed at Old Trafford. He expected the best of himself and his teammates.",
      "Yet, despite some of the negative stories about the former Reds captain, Nardiello spoke fondly of his time working with the midfielder, even if he did stop training in the middle of a session - without any sort of warning - during an international break.",
      "\"Keane was unbelievable. If training wasn't right... I actually remember him stopping training a couple of times to make sure the lads were doing the work and doing things right,\" Nardiello said. \"He expected 100% effort and commitment from lads all the time in training.",
      "\"I remember it was an international break and there was a lot of reserve team lads training with the first-team lads who were not on international duty and he stopped the session to make sure lads were doing the right things and making sure the passing was correct and that type of thing.",
      "\"But on top of that, it was the encouragement levels he gave you as well. I don't know if people saw this but the encouragement he gave specifically to me was second to none, he guided me in certain aspects and also encouraged me a lot. I remember him playing a couple of reserve team games and it was nothing but good advice and guidance and encouragement.",
      "\"Of course when things weren't going right on the pitch, he may shout and scream at certain players for not doing things, but that's what leaders do, they expect the best. For me, he's one of the best captains that United have probably ever had, or that world football has ever seen.\"",
      "While Nardiello never actually played with Keane, he did spend time in the same squad as another Reds legend. In fact, his last appearance for the club came in place of Cristiano Ronaldo, with the attacker replacing the Portuguese ace in the latter stages of a shock 2-0 defeat to West Brom in the 2003/04 Carling Cup.",
      "It was Ronaldo's first appearance in the competition, and while it ended in a loss, it was clear how talented he was and what he could bring to Old Trafford. The tricky winger went on to make 346 appearances for the Reds, registering 145 goals and 64 assists. For Nardiello, it was clear that his teammate was destined for greatness - even after a surprise loss to the Baggies.",
      "He said: \"He [Ronaldo] was clearly an unbelievably talented young lad when I was there, I think when he signed he was 18 or 19. You could see in training and in games that he obviously had a lot of ability and potential, but I don't know if anyone would have predicted how amazing his career would be.",
      "\"The fact that he's probably one of the greatest players to have ever lived, I don't think many people would have predicted that. A lot is down to the guidance he had under Sir Alex, but also down to his own mentality, work rate and belief in himself.",
      "\"To score the number of goals he has, I don't think anyone who maybe watched him in the first couple of seasons at Manchester United would have predicted the level he actually got to, but fair play to him because he was just an absolute monster and still is!\"",
      "The majority of Ronaldo's appearances for United came as a starter. Nardiello, on the other hand, made just one start, in the League Cup, but unlike in the other three matches, he was on the winning side on that occasion.",
      "United secured a 2-0 victory over Leicester City in November 2002, with Nardiello in the attack alongside Diego Forlan and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Behind him were Quinton Fortune and David Beckham, while Ferdinand, David May, John O'Shea, Gary Neville and Phil Neville formed the defence. Roy Carroll completed a strong line-up for the Reds.",
      "Much like the feeling of making his debut for the club, achieving his first start for United - and one that came in a victory - was pleasing for Nardiello. After three substitute appearances and three defeats, he was finally part of a winning side under Ferguson.",
      "\"It was great starting a game and again there were no nerves or anything like that, it was just a case of trying to do as well as I could on the day,\" Nardiello added. \"Looking back now and looking at the starting line-up from that game, it was a really strong starting XI, with me being probably the weakest link in the starting XI.",
      "\"It was great that Sir Alex had the confidence to put me in and to say I've played alongside those lads, although I did it in training and a few reserve team matches, it was amazing and something I look back on with pride.\"",
      "With Nardiello having spent time out on loan in the 2003/04 season, it became clear that his time at Old Trafford was starting to come to an end. The striker impressed during a one-month loan to Swansea City, but it was his stint with Barnsley that really helped to kick-start his career.",
      "He scored two goals on his debut and bagged seven times in 16 games before returning to United. Having become a fan favourite with the Barnsley fans, he returned again to Oakwell on a season-long loan for the following campaign. Despite struggling with injuries, Nardiello still managed 30 games, scoring seven goals.",
      "Upon his return to United at the end of the season, he had an open and honest conversation with Ferguson. The Scotsman offered him the chance to remain at the club but suggested that it would be better for Nardiello's career if he moved on. In the end, it was decided that he would be released upon the expiry of his contract, with Nardiello making a permanent move to League One side Barnsley, though he now admits he should have extended his stay at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I kind of knew it was coming towards an end, I got to a certain age where I was playing regularly on loan at decent-sized clubs, but it wasn't Premiership clubs,\" Nardiello said. \"I got called into the office by Sir Alex, had a sit-down with him and he said he could give me another year, but he said he thought I should go out on a permanent basis and play regular football.",
      "\"I think he was just being kind saying he could give me an extra year, looking back I probably should have said, 'Give me that extra year then' but it seemed like the natural end to my time there.",
      "\"I don't think I was upset, it was just one of those things you have to deal with in football. It was an end of an era in terms of leaving Manchester United, but I was just focused on building my career.\"",
      "Given that Ferguson gave him the chance to represent United, Nardiello still has a lot of love and respect for the legendary figure. He suggested it was a 'privilege' to play under him - and recalled a meeting with the Scot years after he had left Old Trafford. It was, in many ways, a perfect anecdote to describe Ferguson the man, rather than the manager.",
      "\"He [Ferguson] was obviously a huge success while I was there, and after I left he achieved so much more as well,\" he said. \"He's the best manager that's ever lived and I was lucky enough to play under him, albeit in a handful of games. It was a privilege to work under him and learn from him.",
      "\"He did go into a lot of detail with every individual player. I remember when I was coming towards the end of my football career, I actually bumped into him at The Alexandra Hospital. I was having a check-up on an injury and he was having a check-up on something and we happened to be seeing the same doctor.",
      "\"He came over to me and said, 'You're doing really well, scoring goals at Bury'. I was thinking, 'How does he even know, 10 or 15 years after I'd left the club, that I'm at Bury towards the end of my career?'. How he knew that after however many years it was, to come up to start speaking to me, the physio I was with was in shock!\"",
      "Nardiello, like many former players, reflects on his career with pride. In fact, his first appearance for the club came alongside two other debutants - Lee Roche and Jimmy Davis. Given that Nardiello featured alongside both Roche and Davis in the 4-0 defeat to Arsenal in their first showing in a United shirt, he will always be connected to the pair in some way.",
      "In August 2003, Davis - who had left the Reds to join Watford on loan - was travelling to Vicarage Road for their opening game of the season against Coventry City when he collided with a lorry and died. He was 21 years old at the time of his death.",
      "Understandably, Nardiello admitted Davis' death came as a shock to everyone. It was a difficult period for anyone who knew Davis, but now, two decades on from his death, Nardiello is able to speak glowingly about his former teammate - both as a player, but also as a person.",
      "\"The anniversary of his death always pops up on social media, and you always give him a thought,\" he said. \"It was a huge shock, and I know it's easy for me to say now, but he was an unbelievable talent, an unbelievable player. Whether he was at United or somewhere else, he would have had an unbelievable career. He genuinely was excellent, one of the better youth team players, for sure.",
      "\"He could even have done it at Manchester United on a regular basis, that's how good he was. It was extremely sad because a guy I've grown up with, played regularly with. He was a great character in and around the changing room, everyone loved him. His family are lovely, they were not too far from where my family are from in the Midlands.",
      "\"Heartbreaking really, really sad what happened there and may he rest in peace.\"",
      "United paid tribute to Davis during their 2003 FA Community Shield victory against Arsenal, with both teams wearing black armbands during the match. Later in the season, the Reds - at the suggestion of Keane - paid tribute to him once again. After lifting the 2004 FA Cup, the players changed into shirts printed with Davis' name and squad number, 36.",
      "Davis made just one senior appearance for United, but he was clearly a popular member of the group and played his part in and around the training ground. Like Nardiello, he managed to achieve something that the majority of people can only ever dream of.",
      "Playing for Manchester United, at Old Trafford, under Sir Alex Ferguson, was a dream come true for Daniel Nardiello. He managed something special, and no one can ever take that away from him.",

      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery says his side must stop Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana from playing out from the back in their upcoming Premier League fixture if they are to win.",
      "United travel to Villa Park on Sunday to face an Aston Villa side that has seen their hopes of a top four finish stumble somewhat in recent weeks. Last weekend's 5-0 win over relegation-threatened Sheffield United was only Villa's second win in the Premier League since Christmas and Emery's side we dumped out of the FA Cup in their fourth round replay against Chelsea midweek.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of the game, Emery highlighted Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot and Casemiro as being key players for United.",
      "Admitting the upcoming match is crucial, the Villa boss said: \"It's a new challenge for us, it's a new challenge for our supporters and it's a new challenge in Villa Park to feel strong like we were. This is a challenge. We have to be together, we have to use our positive energy everybody. Each individual fan has to support us with their energy.",
      "\"Even like that, it's going to be a very, very difficult match because they will need to get points and close the difference to us in the table. When we're facing matches like this of course we have to be consistent in 38 matches but it's a key match. We have to try to create a great atmosphere with our supporters.\"",
      "Several players including Ezri Konsa (knee), Lucas Digne (hamstring), Emi Buendia (knee), Jhon Duran (hamstring) and Tyrone Mings (knee) are all out due to injuries. But Emery believes if his side can stop United from playing out from the back then they should be in with a chance of claiming the three points.",
      "Emery commented: \"We have to try to stop them (United), starting with the goalkeeper because his build-up is fantastic. Their centre-backs like to play, building up and controlling ball possession, trying to get good combinations on the pitch.",
      "\"Luke Shaw is very dangerous and Diogo Dalot is in a good moment. Casemiro is a very important player for them; they have very good wingers and strikers and that is my concern.\"",

      "The 22-year-old has five goals and four assists in 19 matches in Spain's top-flight. He joined the Madrid-based club during the summer transfer window after being exiled by United following an investigation by the police and internally in January 2022.",
      "Greenwood faced accusations of rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour, but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case after a lengthy investigation that concluded last year.",
      "With less than 18 months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, the United academy product will likely leave Erik ten Hag's side. It remains to be seen where his next destination will be, but he has enjoyed his start to life in Spain, and reports suggest that he could be attracting interest.",
      "Here is a round-up of the latest news.",
      "Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid emerged as a possible transfer destination for Mason Greenwood.",
      "The Spanish side missed out on a move for Juventus and former Everton striker Moise Kean after the deal fell through. According to The Telegraph, the Argentine tactician is looking to bolster his strike options, and the one-time England international is said to have attracted attention.",
      "It has been claimed that Greenwood has \"impressed other Spanish teams\" with his performances this season. The 22-year-old featured during their dramatic 3-3 draw with Atletico earlier this season.",
      "Antoine Griezmann scored twice and seemingly fired Los Rojiblancos to three points until late goals from Oscar Rodriguez and Borja Mayoral earned a point. Greenwood's performance earned praise from the France international Griezmann; he said: \"In the end, you hold on... Greenwood hurt us a lot, we couldn't stop him at the end of the game and two goals came.\"",
      "Mason Greenwood was back in the spotlight following Getafe's 2-0 defeat against Real Madrid as La Liga began an investigation.",
      "It is alleged that Jude Bellingham made an offensive remark during a recent fixture between Getafe and Real. The incident prompted a response from Getafe boss Jose Bordalas, who said: \"I know the same thing that you know. It’s not up to me, it’s the club, La Liga and the Federation that have to make an assessment about it.",
      "\"The only thing that I can say is that I ask for respect from Mason Greenwood because he is a great guy. He is a man who respects everyone and has exemplary behaviour.\"",
      "Despite the media attention, the 22-year-old was left undeterred, as he was on target for Getafe in a 1-1 draw at Real Betis to keep Bordalás' side in midtable.",
      "Mason Greenwood revealed in January that he is 'happy' at Getafe.",
      "His effort against Betis made it two goals in three games as speculation emerged over where he could move next. Barcelona are also said to be rivalling Atletico Madrid for the 22-year-old's signature, but nonetheless, the Englishman is enjoying his time in the Spanish capital.",
      "\"Everything's fine,\" he said, speaking to Getafe's official YouTube channel. \"I adapted pretty quickly. [My] team-mates took me under their wing and I've just been happy ever since, coming here and training, playing the games. I'm happy.",
      "\"The fans mean a lot to me. The best feeling so far is when I scored my first goal here at the stadium and it meant a lot to me, I heard the fans quite a lot.",

      "The appearance, streamed on Sky Sports Football's YouTube channel, was Sancho’s third since signing for Dortmund in the January window. He recorded two assists in his first two appearances against Darmstadt 98 and FC Koln.",

      "\"We naturally advocated for an option with him - and also with Ian - but the negotiating position was not such that we could implement it and so we will accept it for now.\"",
      "Sancho and Dortmund will be back in action next weekend when they take on Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. The win on Friday night left them in fourth place in the table, although most of their rivals now have a game in hand over them.",

      "Man United youngster Kobbie Mainoo has been excellent since coming into the team and England have been watching.",
      "Just a few days after Manchester United's win against Everton in October, the chatter among journalists while watching training at Carrington was about Kobbie Mainoo and whether he could make the England squad for this summer's European Championship.",
      "A raucous atmosphere was expected at Goodison Park due to Everton's point deduction but that didn't stop Erik ten Hag from giving Mainoo his first start in the Premier League. Unsurprisingly, the unflappable Mainoo was unfazed by the hostility and he delivered an exceptional performance which saw him pick up the man of the match award.",
      "\"The biggest compliment I can pay him, and it hurts to say this, I hope people can take this in the right spirit,\" said Gary Neville, who was on commentary for Sky Sports. \"He looked like a Manchester City player. Honestly, I was watching him and thinking, ‘that’s a player that Pep Guardiola will be looking at and thinking, ‘I want him in my midfield'.",
      "\"Thankfully United have got him because he looks so composed, so graceful, always looking over his shoulder, knowing where everyone is, letting it run across his body.\"",
      "Mainoo's performance was special. It generated a buzz. He's been excellent since making that first league start and he's currently one of the first names on the team sheet.",
      "Each challenge Mainoo has faced, he has overcome. There have been tests away at Galatasaray, Newcastle and Liverpool and those appearances only enhanced his reputation.",
      "Mainoo had been the academy's best-kept secret for a few years and that is no longer the case because - while he is still just 18 years old - he looks destined for the top of the sport.",
      "Those who know Mainoo best paint a picture of a grounded, likeable young man and sources have indicated they would be surprised if he ever got ahead of himself.",
      "Mainoo recently pulled over, despite being at the start of a roundabout, to sign autographs for fans who had waved him down. He also made a heartwarming gesture when inviting a supporter and his son to Old Trafford, following the loss of a family member, whose last game watching United before passing away was against Wolves when he scored a late match-winning goal.",
      "Those small gestures show that 'he gets it' and sources have previously stressed he has the talent and temperament to succeed, which points to an exciting future.",
      "Mainoo is remarkably mature on the pitch and away from it for someone his age and if he continues to perform at the same level, the calls for him to play for England will only grow louder.",
      "The midfielder's family background is Ghanaian and he regularly visits the country. He is eligible to play for the Back Stars but he's expected to pick England for his international career.",
      "Mainoo has represented the Three Lions throughout the youth levels and, last year, a source close to the player confidently said he would progress to play for England.",
      "Ghana's FA recently declared their interest in Mainoo and told The Times: “Ghana is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of such incredible talents, and the Association will love to work with him and many like him home and abroad.”",
      "Mainoo will have to make a decision and that might be required sooner than he anticipated because he has an outside chance of making England's squad for 2024.",
      "Gareth Southgate plays with a midfield three and Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice are deservedly automatic starters, but the remaining midfield squad positions are up for grabs.",
      "Kalvin Phillips has made a disappointing start to life at West Ham, Jordan Henderson has hurried back to Europe to sign for Ajax after making the move to Saudi Arabia in a PR disaster and Conor Gallagher is out of form in a struggling Chelsea side. The other options, James Ward-Prowse, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Curtis Jones, also fail to inspire, whereas Cole Palmer deserves to be included.",
      "Gareth Southgate vowed to select players based on form and not reputation when he was appointed England manager and Mainoo could be included in his squad if that is true.",
      "There's plenty of football to be played from now until the end of the season. Mainoo has been outstanding in recent weeks and he might force himself into England contention if that continues.",

      "Unai Emery could welcome an injured star back to action for the clash against Manchester United at Villa Park this weekend. The Red Devils head into the clash off the back of two consecutive victories over Wolves and West Ham, while the hosts enter the fixture having surprisingly lost their last two games on home soil.",
      "Injury news is dominating news ahead of the game and while it may appear the likes of United, Tottenham and Liverpool, have been hit harder by injuries, Villa have seen a number of important players miss action. Tyrone Mings and Emi Buendia are both still expected to remain out with long-term injuries picked up back in August.",
      "Nicolo Zaniolo, Diego Carlos, Alex Moreno and Jacob Ramsey have all been affected by injuries this season but the quartet are now all back available. And yet there is still a number of players missing out with Ezri Konsa the latest player to pick up an issue.",
      "In the 5-0 victory against Sheffield United, the versatile defender was forced off just beyond the hour mark with Emery revealing he could be out until March. \"He will not be available for three or four weeks, more or less,\" the Villa boss said on Tuesday.",
      "No Konsa will arrive as a significant blow considering he has played in every single Premier League game under Emery, but Pau Torres was back on the bench for the FA Cup defeat to Chelsea. Following that update, Emery provided the latest on Lucas Digne which hints he could be back soon.",
      "On Friday, in a press conference, Emery admitted: \"The players who had injuries are recovering, like Lucas, Torres.\" Given Torres was back in the squad earlier this week, Emery grouping the duo suggests Digne could be back very soon.",
      "A matchday squad appearance for the France international is unlikely however and with that, alongside Konsa's absence, Matty Cash and Alex Moreno remaining as the full-backs to face Man United looks likely. A start and 90-minute appearance for Ollie Watkins is also seen as a given with Jhon Duran out injured with a hamstring injury suffered late into the January clash against Everton.",
      "As for Erik ten Hag, Lisandro Martinez will miss the game after it was confirmed he would be out for up to eight weeks with a knee injury. Mason Mount, Tyrell Malacia and Anthony Martial are also expected to miss out with the Man United boss offering a worrying Aaron Wan-Bissaka update on Thursday.",
      "\"Aaron Wan-Bissaka, today, was training but then he dropped out,\" the Dutchman revealed. \"So I don't know, in this moment, where he is and what is the diagnosis. Hopefully, he is not too bad.\"",

      "Manchester United will be targeting a fourth successive victory in all competitions when they lock horns with Aston Villa at Villa Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, who came from behind to beat Villa 2-0 at Old Trafford on Boxing Day and maintained their recent resurgence with a comfortable 3-0 win over West Ham United last time out. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho (2) and Rasmus Hojlund made it back-to-back Premier League wins.",
      "The victory over West Ham moved United up to sixth in the table, boosting their chances of clinching Champions League qualification for next season. At the time of writing, they are currently eight points behind fourth-placed Villa, highlighting the size of this weekend's meeting between the two clubs.",
      "Manager Erik ten Hag made just one change to his starting line-up for the clash with West Ham from the win at Wolves three days earlier, bringing Harry Maguire back into the equation at Raphael Varane's expense. Varane will be chomping at the bit to return at Villa Park and fill the void that will be vacated by the injured Lisandro Martinez.",
      "As ever, Andre Onana is expected to continue in goal. He has started each of United's 23 Premier League matches this season and that trend is expected to continue in the Midlands.",
      "As for the back-four, Diogo Dalot is highly likely to continue at right-back after producing excellent performances against Wolves and West Ham, while Luke Shaw, because of a lack of depth, is expected to continue at left-back.",
      "Shaw has been touted as the ideal candidate to cover for Martinez given he is left-footed, but him sliding across would create a new selection headache with Tyrell Malacia still unavailable. In Martinez's absence, Varane could partner Maguire in the heart of the back-four.",
      "It would be unnecessary for Ten Hag to make any alterations in midfield after the success brought to the table by Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in the last few games. They have formed United's strongest midfield trio and it should avoid being dismantled.",
      "The same can be said with the front three, with Marcus Rashford and Garnacho expected to provide support for Hojlund. They have each got on the scoresheet in the last two games. The likes of Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen and Antony should once again start on the bench.",

      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United, on the other hand, have so much pace on the counter attack and are feeling good again, so I can't see Villa dealing with their threat. I usually never fancy Manchester United away from home, but I think Villa have been sussed out at home in recent weeks, so I'm going for a 2-2 draw.",

      "Ten Hag might be wishing he had never sent Sergio Reguilon back to Tottenham. If the Spaniard was still available he could use Luke Shaw at centre-back, but Reguilon's departure and Malacia's ongoing injury issues mean the England international has to play at left-back.",
      "From a defensive point of view I would bring Harry Maguire back in, even if that is not ideal for what Ten Hag wants in build-up play. He has played on the left of the defence for England, even if Ten Hag has been reluctant to play him there.",
      "The rest of the team should be easier to pick. Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are starting to dovetail nicely and Bruno Fernandes can benefit from the freedom that pair offers him.

      "The main talking points as Man Utd travel to face Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Manchester United will be hoping to keep their fine run of form going when they travel to face Aston Villa in a vital Premier League fixture on Sunday.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side have won four of six matches since their Boxing Day win over Villa, while the hosts have won just three of seven and crashed out of the FA Cup in midweek.",
      "United need a positive performance to keep their slim hopes of Champions League qualification alive, but they must do so without key defender Lisandro Martinez for the foreseeable future. Here are the main talking points for the match:",
      "A defeat today could all but spell the end of United's hopes of Champions League football and the lucrative prize pot to go along with it. UEFA has confirmed a £400million increase in prize money for the Champions League starting next season, and United will be desperate to have a part of it.",
      "Manchester City were awarded £115million in prize money for winning the competition last season, and any team that qualifies for the new format could expect roughly €20million for just taking part, with around €3million awarded for every win and €1million for every draw. It's fair to estimate it at around €35million, even if United didn't qualify for the final stages.",
      "Integral to United's hopes of a win today and their subsequent hopes of qualifying for the Champions League is how they replace Martinez. The Argentine defender is arguably the most influential player in Ten Hag's side, given his excellent defensive ability as well as his unique playmaking quality as a left-footed defender.",
      "Ten Hag has put huge significance on the importance of having a left-footed option in central defence, but with Luke Shaw required at left-back, there is no similar replacement available.",
      "Raphael Varane is arguably the best choice to come in given his obvious quality and experience, but Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof have both been preferred to him at different stages of the season. It's a huge call that Ten Hag has to get right.",
      "It looked like a turning point in United's season when they defeated Aston Villa on Boxing Day. Now they must prove they aren't going round in circles.",
      "United followed up that impressive win with a defeat at Nottingham Forest, throwing away two-goal leads against Newport County and Wolves, even riding their luck at times against West Ham last time out.",
      "Things have been far harder than they have looked on paper, but there has certainly been some improvement. Today is a chance to show just how far they really have come and prove they really have turned a corner.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has been on a roll since he netted his first Premier League goal in the reverse fixture, but there is still plenty of work to be done. Depending on your narrative, he either has four goals in his last four league matches or four in his last 18.",
      "Today he will be up against Ollie Watkins, a key component of Aston Villa's excellent start to the campaign and a player who has been earning plenty of plaudits for his exploits this season.",
      "The praise for Watkins is thoroughly deserved, though it also highlights just how good Hojlund has been. Watkins has 16 goals from 33 appearances, and Hojlund has 10 from 28 this season. Watkins has a better record, especially when you consider his 12 assists as well, but he is also seven years older than Hojlund and has Premier League experience.",
      "In the last month, Hojlund has shown that he is capable of being a top Premier League striker, though the ultimate test is if he finds the consistency required on a weekly basis. Watkins has done that this season and Hojlund is still a work in progress.",
      "Since winning 15 home Premier League games in a row between March and December 2023, Aston Villa have won one of their last three (D1 L1), only conceding one fewer goal in the last three games (6) than they did across their entire 15-game winning run (7).",
      "They face a United side who have won 17 of their 28 Premier League away games against Villa, though they did lose at Villa Park last season.",
      "It means Emery has won both of his Premier League home games against United (2-0 with Arsenal in March 2019 and 3-1 with Aston Villa last season), and he could become the first manager to win his first three at home against them in the competition.",

[Bruno] Fernandes, [Rasmus] Hojlund, [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Marcus] Rashford are such a threat. But where Man Utd have toiled is the loss of key players at the back.",
      "\"Casemiro, for a start, who had a wonderful start to his career has been out for months. Shaw has been out too, but at least now they have a bit of stability and look a bit more like themselves.\"",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip as updates emerge on Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo amid links of a move to Old Trafford",
      "Manchester United reportedly face a battle with Chelsea to sign Frenkie de Jong.",
      "According to Spanish news outlet Sport, the London club have joined United in showing an interest in signing De Jong this summer. The Netherlands international has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford ever since Erik ten Hag was appointed as manager in 2022.",
      "The report goes on to say that Paris Saint-Germain are also competing with United and Chelsea for the signing of De Jong. It has been claimed that the 25-year-old is open to the idea of leaving Camp Nou, with Barcelona likely to demand a fee over €100 million (£85 million).",
      "De Jong joined Barca in 2019 from Ajax for £65 million but has still been linked with a move away from the La Liga giants in subsequent transfer windows. Despite this, the midfielder has remained at the Camp Nou but there has been increased speculation around his future in recent weeks.",
      "Barca manager Xavi is set to leave the club at the end of the season, which will add more uncertainty to the Spanish giants. Despite the speculation, the report adds that Barcelona would like to keep De Jong at the club, with suggestions of a new contract running until 2029 being offered.",
      "Elsewhere, Nice defender Jean-Clair Todibo has addressed speculation about his future amid links with United. The centre-back was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer, and the rumours emerged again in the January transfer window.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur also reportedly joined the race last month, before instead moving to sign Radu Dragusin from Genoa. Todibo left Barcelona to join Nice on a permanent deal in 2021 following a brief loan spell.",
      "Amid the intense speculation, Todibo has explained why he is not thinking too far ahead in terms of his future. The defender revealed that there was interest in him during the January window, but is instead focused on performing for Nice in the second half of the season.",
      "\"It's always like that. During winter there are requests,\" Todibo said, via 90min. \"I'm very calm about it all. I am at Nice and we're having a great season.",
      "\"I don't have my head elsewhere; if I did it would be difficult for me personally and for the group too. I'm at Nice, I feel really good. We'll see what happens in the summer but we're not there yet.",

      "Reports in Barcelona suggest Frenkie de Jong can leave the Catalan club this summer and Erik ten Hag has been desperate to sign him for Man Utd.",
      "You wouldn't blame Manchester United if they had had their fill of trying to sign Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona, given the extent that a reunion with his former Ajax manager Erik ten Hag dominated their summer of 2022.",
      "It was the deal United spent almost the entire window on, even agreeing a deal with Barcelona, only to have to admit defeat as the clock ticked down. Old Trafford sources have insisted since that De Jong was willing to give up on his dream move to the Nou Camp to play under Ten Hag again, but it was a deal that proved too complicated, partly due to his ongoing wage issues with Barcelona.",
      "A year later United didn't even try and sign the midfielder. Instead, Ten Hag returned to another of his old favourites, signing Mason Mount from Chelsea to play the same kind of connecter role between Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. Mount's United career started badly and has now been stalled by a three-month injury absence that shows no sign of ending just yet.",
      "But this summer De Jong might finally be on the market, with reports emerging in Barcelona on Friday that the 26-year-old could be sold to help fund transfer business, with Xavi departing as manager. The former Barcelona midfielder had been a champion of De Jong's over the last 18 months and he has remained a regular starter in his side when fit and available.",
      "If De Jong does leave Barcelona this summer then Ten Hag will be tempted to make his move, although he might face some of the same battles he had in 2022, chiefly convincing the Dutch midfielder to drop out of the Champions League unless United can salvage qualification to Europe's elite competition over the next three months.",
      "Then there is the issue of finding the funds to sign a player of De Jong's calibre at a time when United are navigating difficulties around the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules. That will have an effect on the budget available to Ten Hag this summer and United will need to sign another striker, with Anthony Martial departing.",
      "In the summer of 2022, United agreed a deal with Barcelona worth €85million, €75million of which was to be paid upfront and the rest in add-ons. Resurrecting that would take a significant chunk out of the summer budget.",
      "The reality for Ten Hag might be that there is no longer the room or the necessity to sign De Jong. In his first summer, he pivoted away from the Barcelona man to sign Casemiro from Real Madrid instead, paying £70million for the Brazilian. In 2023 United spent £55million on Mason Mount. They have an option to sign Sofyan Amrabat for £21million this summer as well and then there is the development of Kobbie Mainoo into a first-team midfielder.",
      "There is certainly no doubting Ten Hag's admiration for De Jong. When United faced Barcelona in the Europa League play-off round in his first season in charge he was effusive about his countryman's abilities as a midfielder.",
      "\"He's a fantastic player and has become even better. Playing out from the back, he always has time,\" he said. \"It was a pleasure working with him. He would strengthen any squad in the world. He's got unique quality.\"",
      "The fact that Ten Hag believes he would \"strengthen any squad in the world\" suggests this is a deal he would like to revisit. But with Mount and Mainoo options in that position and other priorities more pressing this summer, it might be that the best - and only - chance to sign De Jong has already been and gone.",

Rashford, 26, missed a training session at Carrington last month after being pictured out and about during a scheduled trip to Belfast.",
      "The forward was fined £650,000 - equivalent to two weeks wages - after that jaunt and dropped from the United matchday squad for their FA Cup tie with Newport County. Rashford has since returned to the starting lineup and has scored three goals in his last four Premier League appearances.",
      "However, his overall total this season - five goals in 28 games - is drastically down on the 30 he totted-up over 56 matches last campaign. Solskjaer knows Rashford as well as anyone and the ever-popular Norwegian has provided his thoughts on the events which have hampered his output this term - saying the forward's poor form is not Erik ten Hag's fault but the player's himself.",
      "The former United manager, 50, told Reuters: \"Obviously I managed Marcus for three years and I know him. It's not my job to go out and discuss performances, but last season he was fantastic and it's about consistency in football.\"",
      "Solskjaer, who won the treble with United as a player, continued: \"Marcus and many others haven't hit the heights this season. I'm sure he had a wake-up call last week and hopefully that will spur him on.",

      "The return of Casemiro has allowed Mainoo to raise his game even further. In the Brazilian's absence, the United academy graduate was acting as the sole anchor at the base of the midfield, whereas now he is being allowed to get forward that little bit more and express himself.",
      "Though Mainoo, who scored his first Premier League goal in dramatic fashion at Molineux a little over a week ago, has demonstrated he is capable as operating as a No.6, controlling possession from deep and then moving the ball on to more advanced midfield operators, he is a modern-day No.8. A player who wants to operate between the lines and progress the ball and himself up the pitch.",
      "His last-gasp heroics at Molineux highlighted that he is not afraid to get into the penalty area and take aim. His goal was all his own making, demonstrating he is a progressive, forward-thinking player, who is not afraid to venture forward and take risks.",
      "That progressive style of play could provide England with the extra sprinkling of magic they have been missing in the engine room. Ahead of this summer's tournament in Germany, Rice and Bellingham are guaranteed to take two of three places available in Southgate's trademark three-man midfield system.",
      "Rice has often been one of two defensive-midfielders employed by Southgate, with Kalvin Phillips regularly supporting him, while Bellingham has been allowed to pull the strings and get forward in support of the attackers. Bellingham is England's shining star and will be central to their hopes of success for several years to come.",
      "Mainoo is not at Bellingham's level yet, and it is possible he may never be, such is the talent levels of the Real Madrid star, but he possess qualities that would complement the traits of both Rice and Bellingham in a midfield-three. Though the United ace is still in the first phase of his development at senior level, there is an increasing clamour for Southgate to select him sooner rather than later, perhaps even more so to avoid the prospect of him committing his international future to Ghana.",
      "Southgate has admitted he has been impressed by Mainoo's progress and that he is keeping a close eye on him, telling The Telegraph: \"I think he's doing brilliantly for a young player. He's had an excellent start for United.",
      "\"I'm not certain he's necessarily going to be a defensive midfielder, as such. He's quite a progressive player, but he's had a fabulous start to his career and it will be good to monitor him as we go forward.\"",
      "Southgate's acknowledgement of Mainoo's progressive style of play could be a nod to how he intends to use him if selected. Despite the success of Southgate's England tenure, he has often been criticised for being too defensive and refusing to release the handbrake.",
      "England's talent pool is littered with star-studded attacking talent and energy. Mainoo is an energetic operator, who is capable of breaking forward and offering an extra attacking threat, as well as a strong level of control in the middle.",
      "His recent displays have highlighted his varied skill-set, which features a cluster of highly sought-after credentials. One of his most laudable traits is his maturity for a player so young. That is a quality Southgate is likely to warm to.",
      "Mainoo's sharp rise will not automatically secure him a place at Euro 2024, but he has to be in the conversation. With England supporters desperate for the shackles to be taken off, Mainoo could provide the key.",

      "The Telegraph had previously reported that the International Football Association Board (IFAB) had authorized the trial introduction of the new blue card. This is intended to impose a 10-minute time penalty on players if, for example, they have prevented a clear goalscoring opportunity through a minor foul or have verbally attacked officials.",

Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on 2 March.\"",
      "This news will be a relief to many Premier League fans who weren't too keen on the idea. The introduction of blue cards could reduce cynical fouling in football. This is because the punishment might outweigh the benefit of stopping a counter-attack, unlike before when players would happily take a yellow card to prevent a potential goal.",

      "As Manchester United prepare for this weekend's clash with Aston Villa in the Premier League, the focus in the media has been on the future.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's official ratification from the Premier League is set to be announced soon and interest is high on what he may plan to do next. Earlier this week, reports surfaced of the INEOS founder's plans for the future of Old Trafford.",
      "While most would like to see the current stadium redeveloped, Ratcliffe feels fans could accommodate the idea of an entirely new ground built in the vicinity. On Thursday, discussions around next season's kit have dominated the discourse.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a closer look at that and the other big talking points surrounding United at the moment.",
      "Social media was awash with rumours about what the new kit will look like for the Reds. The image circulating across the internet has been relatively well received.",
      "In an inoffensive design, the main talking point was the new front-of-shirt sponsorship. At the beginning of next season, Snapdragon will be sponsoring the home, away and third kits, taking over from the current proprietors TeamViewer.",
      "Financially lucrative as it may be, the design has also earned comparisons to the United Vodafone kits of yesteryear.",
      "MEN Sport says: The biggest concern among fans when a new sponsor comes on board is how it will look plastered on the front of a shirt. While the TeamViewer design was by no means the worst we have seen, it was very noticeable and stood out like a sore thumb.",

      "Another important talking point has surrounded the future of Christian Eriksen. There was talk the Dane could leave United this month with Galatasaray planning to land a late deal in their transfer window.",
      "However, reports suggested Eriksen rejected the proposal from the Turkish club and will remain at the club until the end of the campaign. However, Ratcliffe is thought to be eyeing a move to lower the age of the current squad in his first summer transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport says: This approach by United has been a long time coming. If you look at the successful squads of the past at Old Trafford, youth has been a dominant feature.",
      "Sadly, in the darker periods since, ageing players have clogged up the wage bill and made it impossible for United to manoeuvre in the transfer market. Of course, a balance between youth and experience must be found and whether Eriksen is a good player to part company with is up for debate.",
      "But we are beginning to see signs of a youthful core being brought through under Erik ten Hag which is pleasing. With Ratcliffe in the boardroom, we are likely to witness this approach to rooting out squad players continue.",

      "Erik ten Hag likes a left-footer playing in central defence but after an injury to Lisandro Martinez his options in that area are now thin on the ground.",
      "It was the failure to sign a striker in January to offset Anthony Martial's injury absence that has been the talking point of Manchester United's transfer window, with Erik ten Hag admitting he had wanted to bring in another forward until being told the war chest was empty.",
      "United's ongoing issues in complying with the Premier League's financial rules meant Ten Hag couldn't bring in a striker on loan as he had done in January 2023 with Wout Weghorst. That window saw Jack Butland and Marcel Sabitzer come in on temporary deals as well, but last month Ten Hag's squad got weaker.",
      "That was due to the return to Tottenham of left-back Sergio Reguilon, with a break clause in the season-long loan deal activated on January 4. United explained the decision to send Reguilon back to the capital by citing the return from injury of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia edging closer to first-team action.",
      "\"Sergio fulfilled the role he was brought in for: to provide cover for Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia while both were out with long-term injuries,\" a statement on the United website said.",
      "\"While Luke has missed the past two games with a minor injury, the England international is expected back soon. Tyrell, meanwhile, is getting closer to a return from his knee injury. The versatile Diogo Dalot can also provide further cover at left-back.",
      "\"With fewer games in the second half of the season and injured players returning, there will be less opportunity for Sergio to play. It was decided it was in the best interests of all parties for Reguilon to return to Spurs.\"",
      "A month on that decision looks a little less wise. If Reguilon was still at Old Trafford there's a good chance he would get a chance to add to the dozen appearances he made. In a difficult first half of the campaign, the Spaniard's performances were encouraging.",
      "Instead, he moved to Brentford in January for the rest of the season and has made two positive contributions for the Bees so far. Meanwhile, the situation at United looks less positive than it did a month ago.",
      "Shaw has now made three successive starts since returning from injury, but Malacia is still unavailable to provide cover at left-back and Aaron Wan-Bissaka limped out of training on Thursday. That leaves Dalot and Shaw as the only fit full-backs in Ten Hag's squad.",
      "That is particularly problematic given Ten Hag would now like to use Shaw at centre-back, standing in for Lisandro Martinez whose luckless season continued last week, picking up a knee injury in the win against West Ham that will sideline him for eight weeks. Shaw filled in when Martinez was unavailable last season and Ten Hag has spoken previously of the value of playing a left-footer in that position to help with the build-up play.",
      "It's a subject he touched upon again in his pre-Aston Villa press conference on Thursday, when discussing how he could replace the invaluable Martinez over the next couple of months.",
      "\"We have options [with] how to deal with that position. We have good centre-halves in our squad so the others are available, Luke can play also there,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"I'm quite confident we can keep the process going so others can fulfil the position and also contribute playing in high levels. Those players are experienced.",
      "\"That is an advantage that we have seen [left-footed player in that role]. We have to work on players. They can also develop in such positions when you work with them and coach with them and train them. I see our players in the back line developing their skills when building up.\"",
      "In an ideal scenario, Ten Hag could bring Shaw inside to maintain the balance of a right-footer and a left-footer at the heart of defence. But with Wan-Bissaka and Malacia out, he has no alternatives to play at left-back. Reguilon would have been perfect to play there and give Ten Hag the options he needs.",
      "Instead, one of Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof or Jonny Evans will step in for Martinez. They are capable defenders, although they lack the aggression and ability to step forward that Martinez and Shaw can offer. They are also right-footed and for Ten Hag that will mean an effect on the way his side uses the ball from the back. With Reguilon gone, there is no perfect solution available.",

      "Manchester United will be looking to add a striker to their ranks in the summer with Anthony Martial's departure all but guaranteed at the end of his contract",
      "Manchester United's incoming co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is reportedly unwilling to match Brentford's valuation for Ivan Toney in the summer transfer market.",
      "Toney has recently returned to first-team football after an eight-month ban for gambling-related offences. Incredibly, the 27-year-old has not missed a beat upon his return to the squad and has two goals from three Premier League appearances.",
      "Before his return to football, Toney spoke about his ambition to play for a 'top six' club and with his contract expiring in 2025, clubs are on red alert to make a move at the end of the season. One of the teams likely to be interested is United who are set to have just one recognised centre-forward in their squad come the summer with Anthony Martial expected to depart.",
      "Ratcliffe and INEOS are thought to be compiling a list of transfer targets who are heading into the last 12 months of their contract, so it is likely Toney would make that cut. However, according to the Daily Star, the British billionaire is reluctant to pay the £100m price tag the Bees want.",
      "It is understood he sees little sell-on value in Toney and Ratcliffe has noted his lack of Champions League and international football. Instead of breaking the bank, INEOS is believed to be willing to bid up to £70m for the striker.",
      "Elsewhere, Nice's Khephren Thuram is continuing to be linked to United with reports surfacing from Italy. According to TuttoMercatoWeb, Erik ten Hag is keen on adding a versatile midfielder to his ranks in the summer and the 22-year-old fits the bill.",

      "Man United plan to strengthen their full-back options in the summer transfer window, but who they attempt to bring in could rest on Diogo Dalot's performances.",
      "One of Erik ten Hag's biggest selection headaches during pre-season was caused by who would become Manchester United's first-choice right-back.",
      "After Diogo Dalot made a storming start to the 2022/23 campaign, the Portugal international encountered a couple of injury issues after the World Cup in Qatar. That meant Aaron Wan-Bissaka was drafted back in from the cold and given the opportunity, against all odds, to resurrect his Old Trafford career.",
      "Having featured just once prior to the World Cup, Wan-Bissaka ended the season with a respectable 34 appearances to his name. He started eight of United's last 10 Premier League matches, establishing himself as one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "The 26-year-old topped the right-back pecking order at the start of this season, too, starting each of United's first four Premier League matches before a hamstring injury derailed his start to the campaign. He has since been in out of the team and has missed the last three matches with an unspecified injury.",
      "Manager Erik ten Hag, speaking ahead of Sunday's trip to Aston Villa at his pre-match press conference yesterday, confirmed Wan-Bissaka had attempted to train yesterday morning but had to withdraw from the session, casting doubt over his availability for the trip to Villa Park.",
      "Though his hopes of featuring in the Midlands have not been completely quashed, it would take something special for him to dislodge Dalot from the right-back berth. Arguably the unsung hero of United's recent resurrection, the latter has more than played his part in the recent Premier League victories over Wolves and West Ham United.",
      "Featuring in 31 of United's 33 matches in all competitions so far this season, the 24-year-old has produced performances in each of the last two games that were reminiscent of his showings prior to the World Cup, a period which saw him enjoy his best spell in a United shirt. Often moving inside to carry out the duty of an inverted right-back, Dalot doubled-up with Casemiro to form the base of United's midfield when they had possession.",
      "The inverted full-back tactic is something that is becoming a more regular theme in football nowadays, not least among the elite-level teams. It is a system the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City regularly deploy.",
      "Dalot's ability to move inside and create a midfield overload was certainly apparent at Molineux. He also made it his mission to bomb forward in wide areas and provide support, with his low cross playing a key role in the build-up to Marcus Rashford's opener.",
      "Though he also looked to push forward and move into midfield against West Ham, it was his recovery challenge that stopped a certain goal from Jarrod Bowen in the second half that took top spot on his personal highlights reel. He timed the challenge to perfection to cover for Harry Maguire, sparking one of the loudest cheers of the afternoon outside of United's three goals.",
      "Dalot's recent form is a reminder that he is yet to reach his peak. Not turning 25 until the midway point of next month, there is still plenty of room for growth in his development.",
      "United plan to strengthen at right-back this summer and it is widely thought they need to recruit a player who can automatically assume pole position in the pecking order, with Wan-Bissaka at risk of being offloaded, despite recently having his contract extended by a further year.",
      "However, though Dalot is not considered to be as astute defensively as Wan-Bissaka, he is certainly better going forward. He has chipped in with two goals and two assists so far this season.",
      "With United facing a big decision on who becomes their figurehead at right-back ahead of next season, such is their intention to recruit a new candidate for the role, Dalot's recent performances suggest he is not prepared to give up pole after wrestling the position back from Wan-Bissaka. The duo have fought tooth and nail over the past 12 months and Dalot has moved back in front.",
      "Wan-Bissaka is the more likely candidate to be sold to make way for a replacement in the summer, but it is down to Dalot to determine whether the Reds head into the market looking for a starting right-back or a back-up option. His recent showings suggest United could be hunting for the latter.",

I don't have my head elsewhere; if I did it would be difficult for me personally and for the group too. I'm at Nice, I feel really good. We'll see what happens in the summer but we're not there yet.”",
      "The defender added: \"I don't want to get ahead of myself. I don't want to give false hope. For now, I'm here at Nice. Football moves quickly, you never know what's going to happen. I'll wait until the summer to make my decision. If my decision is to stay, I'll announce it, if it is to leave, I'll announce it too and I'll thank everyone, but we're not there yet.",
      "\"There are important games coming up. The goal is that if it is to be my final season at OGC Nice, then I want to leave here having done something beautiful with the club. The supporters and the club deserve players who give everything on the pitch, and to achieve something substantial. Personally, if I am to leave, I want to leave something good behind.\"",

      "The youngster trained with the first team on Wednesday afternoon in preparation for Aston Villa and he was joined by Sam Mather (19) and Toby Collyer (20). It's unusual for a 16-year-old to train with the senior group but Amass was selected to make up the numbers.",

      "Man Utd youngster Kobbie Mainoo is making exceptional progress and he's already been likened to Paul Pogba.",
      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",
      "Pogba left on a free transfer to join Juventus in the summer of 2012 after failing to agree a new contract when it might have been advisable to build a team around him.",
      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",

      "Manchester United say they are \"very disappointed\" and are 'considering their options' following an FA ruling which has seen them dumped out of the Continental League Cup as a result of Aston Villa's administrative error.",
      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",
      "Maritz, who moved to Bescot Stadium from Women's Super League (WSL) rivals Arsenal earlier this month, was introduced in the second half against Sunderland, despite already being cup-tied. She had featured three times for the Gunners in the competition earlier in the season, starring against Bristol City, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "READ |  Tielemans starts, Bailey returns - Aston Villa starting XI vs Newcastle picked",
      "As a result, her introduction against Sunderland was in breach of Conti Cup rule 8.14 - which deals with the fielding of an ineligible player - and the points for the contest have instead been awarded to the Black Cats. An FA statement released on Monday said: \"An independent tribunal have deducted three points from Aston Villa for fielding an ineligible player during their FA Women’s Continental Tyres League Cup group stage fixture against Sunderland on Wednesday 24 January 2024.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Earps has entered into the last six months of her contract with United and there are no guarantees she will be extending her stay. Barcelona, PSG and Arsenal have all been linked with the 30-year-old who is in-demand.",
      "The shot stopper's stock rose last year thanks to a sensational 12 months for club and country. Among the many accolades she accumulated were BBC Sports Personality of the Year, England Women's Player of the Year and she was also named Manchester United fans' Player of the Year, across the men's and women's teams, by MEN Sport readers.",
      "Back in December, United's head coach Marc Skinner declared he was hopeful Earps would commit to a new contract. \"The club are working through with Mary on what the deal looks like,\" Skinner told the Daily Mirror.",
      "\"I sit here hopeful. I think the talks are exactly where it was. It’s with the club to continue with that. I can’t be any more clear that I want Mary to stay at this club.",
      "\"She’s a huge part of what I want to do and build here but we’ll continue to have those conversations. I haven’t really got an update yet.\"",
      "Earps' new representatives are one of the top agencies in women's football and look after the likes of Sam Kerr, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario. The United 'keeper signed her last contract back in 2021.",

      "Sunday 11 February 2024 07:56, UK",
      "It is an image which will be referenced and reused in years to come.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration at the Argentine's first goal in the win over West Ham, immediately struck as an iconic moment.",
      "But whether it will be looked back on as the dawning of a new era of success for United or a brief flash of promise which faded away will be down to that talented trio, the group around them and the work of head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "Promise is one thing but at United results are demanded right now.",
      "That was the message emphasised by Ten Hag as he sat down with Sky Sports at United's training ground, still warming up after a session out in the sleet and wind at Carrington. They were tough conditions, he says, but these are the decisive days - and even in February, United are in must-win mode.",
      "Back-to-back victories last week against Wolves and West Ham have boosted the mood - \"It gives confidence,\" says the Dutchman - but if the team are to achieve Champions League qualification, the eight-point gap to fourth-placed Aston Villa must be closed when United go to play Unai Emery's men on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "\"We have some exciting players,\" smiles Ten Hag when asked about Hojlund (aged 21), Garnacho (19) and Mainoo (18) sat together.",
      "\"We also have had such [standout] moments during the season - for instance, the brilliant goal from Garnacho against Everton,\" he says, referencing that spectacular overhead kick at Goodison Park.",
      "\"We have some very high potentials in this squad. And now we have to perform to high levels.",
      "\"We do it now in some games but on Sunday, for instance, we get an opposition who have a very high level. So that's a challenge to perform there and to get end product from those players on Sunday. So they are the next steps, which have to come.\"",
      "Ten Hag knows all about the power and momentum in-form young players can bring to a team. It was a driving force during his time at Ajax. It has also long been a foundation for success at United.",
      "Coupled with the experience of players such as Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, it can be a winning formula.",
      "\"They bring energy,\" says Ten Hag of his young players. \"I think it's always a combination of experience and high potentials. And when they respect each other, and they want to strengthen each other, then you have a team and that is always the objective because every player knows when there is a team you can achieve higher performances and higher levels and so achieve more.\"",
      "Another key ingredient, of course, is goals. And in Hojlund, United now have a striker who looks to have finally found his feet in the Premier League. There were a flurry of strikes in Europe earlier in this campaign but with four goals in his last four top-flight games, it feels like the big-money summer signing is now starting to deliver.",
      "That scoring streak began against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, when he hit a late winner in a comeback victory at Old Trafford. The relief and release of pressure when that ball found the net was plain to see in his celebration. But it is perhaps the consistency of selection in attack which has maintained his run of form.",
      "In each of United's last four Premier League games, they've had Marcus Rashford and Garnacho flanking the young Dane. The front three have a combined 10 goals and three assists in those matches - more than the 10 goal involvements they've registered between them in other Premier League games this season.",
      "\"Football is about co-operation,\" says Ten Hag. \"Finding the spaces by movements, by moving the ball and bringing players into positions where they can attack opponents or get into one-on-one situations. And then those players have the abilities to score goals.\"",
      "Finding familiar patterns and combinations across the pitch has been an issue for United and Ten Hag throughout this campaign because of a long list of injuries. Ten Hag celebrated the fact he could finally name his strongest XI for the first time this term against Wolves last week. A game later, he lost Lisandro Martinez to a knee injury.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" he says when asked if that has been the great frustration of this season. \"It stops the progress.",
      "\"Every time you have to adjust you don't have routines, you don't have partnerships and that is what we have seen.",
      "\"I think we have had nine different set-ups in the centre-half positions. In other positions we have to swap a lot and that was forced by injuries so we hope now we can keep a consistent team.\"",
      "United will certainly have to be at their best this weekend. Ten Hag describes the work of his counterpart at Aston Villa, Unai Emery, as \"incredible\", and the hosts will be eager to respond to their surprise FA Cup replay loss to Chelsea on Wednesday night. But this is the time when United need their stars - and rising stars - to step up.",
      "\"We know we can beat them,\" says Ten Hag, referring to the Boxing Day win. \"But Sunday is a new game. It's a test. We have to take the chance.\"",

      "Our tipster Jones Knows provides his betting insight and analysis ahead of the Premier League weekend as he hunts down some value in Sky Bet's markets.",
      "This is a fiddly fixture for Arsenal, fraught with danger.",
      "The 8/15 with Sky Bet for the away win is easily passed up. Not only have West Ham twice played the frustration game on Arsenal this season beating them 2-0 at the Emirates and 3-1 in the Carabao Cup, David Moyes is developing a strong home record against the traditional big-six teams. West Ham have only lost two of their last eight home games against such opposition in the Premier League, including holding the Gunners to 2-2 last April. They can avoid another defeat.",
      "Why Mikel Arteta deserves praise not ridicule - The Radar",
      "There are some fancy prices available in the West Ham player shots market with the bookmaker algorithms expecting Arsenal to minimise the Hammers threat. However, the Gunners have shipped 10 shots per game in their away matches this season in all competitions as they do tend to sit a little deeper and allow opposition more of the possession than in their home games. West Ham have also averaged 11.5 shots per 90 in those recent home fixtures against the big six.",
      "It all points to Emerson Palmieri's lines looking very backable. He's been tasked with providing the width down the left flank since Lucas Paqueta's injury. He's had 10 shots in his last eight starts meaning his odds of Evens with Sky Bet for one or more shots and the 5/1 for two or more are betting angles to seriously consider.",
      "Teams have found a way to stop Aston Villa. Home defeats to both Newcastle and Chelsea had been coming based on some sticky overall performances of late, notably in the 3-2 win over Burnley and draw with Everton. There is a common denominator with Villa's drop in levels in that Pau Torres has been missing.",
      "They've struggled without his confidence with the ball and leadership without it. Opposition have cut off the supply lines to Douglas Luiz and Boubacar Kamara by pinning them in and allowing Diego Carlos and Clement Lenglet to pass out.",
      "Villa have subsequently made hard work of breaking the lines and moving the ball quickly. When then losing possession, teams have manage to expose Villa down the channels in behind their full-backs. Also, this lack of confidence in their crucial offside trap does make it easier for opposition players to make their runs.",
      "Torres is key to all of this and his unavailability from the start makes the price for an away win look rather attractive at 21/10 with Sky Bet, especially as in Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho they posses the perfect type of direct wingers to expose Villa's vulnerability down the flanks. The pair ran riot in the 3-2 comeback win at Old Trafford with Garnacho scoring twice. They can lead United to their fourth straight away win in all competitions. Momentum is building.",
      "The 9/1 with Sky Bet on them making top-four does look a play to consider while you can get it.",
      "Trying to win football matches is hard enough when Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze are unavailable but when you throw Marc Guehi into the injury mix too, Palace are a seriously weakened outfit.",
      "Breaking up the Guehi-Joachim Anderson partnership at the back is likely to make the whole Hodgson masterplan of containment crumble to bits. In 83 Premier League matches with Guehi and Anderson starting, Palace have a very healthy 31.3 per cent win rate. Take one of them out and that win rate drops to 12.5 per cent.",
      "In those 16 games, Palace concede an average of 1.8 goals per 90 and have lost 10 of those fixtures.",
      "Chelsea aren't exactly reliable but with confidence and spirit soaring after their impressive midweek 3-1 win at Villa, they can make it 12 Premier League wins in a row over Crystal Palace - that would equal the record for successive wins for one team against another in Premier League history.",
      "Rather than back Chelsea at precarious prices though, I'd rather invest in some Enzo Fernandez angles on what should be an evening of Chelsea racking up the shots count trying to pick their way through the Hodgson block. The Argentine should be full of himself, in a good way, following his sumptuous goal at Villa Park.",
      "His raw average of 1.99 shots per 90 in the Premier League is enough on its own to make the 10/11 with Sky Bet on him having two or more shots an appealing wager but when you throw in the likely one-sided game-state along with his increased confidence levels you've got yourself a blinding spot of value to attack.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly looking to build a new stadium for Manchester United; the British billionaire is set to acquire a £1.2bn stake in the club and will put £239m into the club's infrastructure; Ratcliffe wants to build a 'Wembley of the North'",
      "Thursday 8 February 2024 06:12, UK",
      "Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators.",
      "The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which moved a step closer after a successful vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday.",
      "\"I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,\" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",
      "\"It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium.\"",
      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",

Draws really are no good for Sheffield United in their predicament, so I'm fully expecting a goal-heavy encounter.",
      "No Premier League player is averaging more offsides per 90 this season (1.27) than Darwin Nunez as his eagerness to break offside traps has seen him flagged offside 22 times in his last 15 starts. That included being caught by Burnley's trap twice in the reverse fixture in December. Vincent Kompany's team do like to play a high line - only five teams have caught more players offside more than this season than the Clarets (47).",
      "All this adds up to Nunez's offside probabilities looking very strong at the 10/11 with Sky Bet offered for one or more.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's raw average of 1.99 shots per 90 in the Premier League is enough on its own to make the 10/11 with Sky Bet on him having two or more shots an appealing wager but when you throw in the likely one-sided game-state vs Crystal Palace along with his increased confidence levels you've got yourself a blinding spot of value to attack.",
      "As hinted above, there is a clear trend developing that these types of games down at the bottom are producing more attacking intent than what the expected models are spitting out for the bookmaker lines. Of the 25 games involving both Sheffield United, Luton, Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford this season, the overall goal average has been 3.04 per game - above what has been expected by the market. And 40 per cent of those 25 games have seen four or more goals scored. The goal lines are worth attacking with the 9/2 on offer for five or more goals a sensible play considering all the evidence.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White ran amok playing in his preferred free role in the reverse fixture between Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, racking up an expected goals tally of 0.33 from his three shots at goal.",
      "I'm adamant we're dealing with a Champions League level player in time and his goalscorer prices remain hard to ignore with 13/2 anytime available with Sky Bet. He has scored twice since Nuno Espirito Santo took the reins and we have the added bonus of him being the likely penalty taker, which are being awarded at a rate of 0.29 per game this season meaning that 13/2 is a slice of value just on those grounds.",

      "The Radar column looks at the curious reluctance to praise Mikel Arteta's work at Arsenal and how Rasmus Hojlund has taken matters into his own hands to solve his scoring issues at Manchester United",
      "Sunday 11 February 2024 07:42, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta takes his Arsenal side to West Ham's London Stadium on Super Sunday on the back of a resounding victory over leaders Liverpool which reignited their Premier League title hopes.",
      "The underlying numbers highlighted Arsenal's superiority. Their total of 3.50 expected goals was the highest by any side against Liverpool on record. At the other end of the pitch, Jurgen Klopp's team were limited to only 0.37 expected goals, their lowest total of the season.",
      "It was an outstanding display, even factoring in the defensive lapse which allowed Liverpool back into the game on the stroke of half-time. But all that was rather lost in the fallout.",
      "Instead, the focus centred on the manner in which they enjoyed it. Arteta is not the first manager to celebrate a crucial goal by sprinting out of his technical area. Jurgen Klopp can testify to that. But rarely has the act provoked quite so much censure. At least not since the last time he did it.",
      "The obsession with Arteta's touchline behaviour fails to acknowledge the role of his emotional investment in improving the atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium. His intensity feeds into that of the crowd. Home advantage has been enhanced.",
      "Sunday's game was just the latest example. A once indifferent arena now crackles with anticipation for the biggest games. Connections have been forged. The mood has been transformed.",
      "If Arteta's perceived ill-discipline is somehow setting a bad example, it is not rubbing off on his players. They have received the fewest bookings in the Premier League this season having gone through the entirety of last term without a red card.",
      "More important than all that, though, is that Arteta has created a team capable of producing results like the one they celebrated on Sunday with increasing regularity.",
      "Arsenal have played six games against big-six opponents in the Premier League this season and not lost once. Manchester City, like Liverpool, left the Emirates defeated, having managed only 0.48 expected goals, a figure that remains their lowest of the season.",
      "Arteta has been healthily backed, of course. Both in terms of time and financial support. But Arsenal's re-emergence as contenders over the last 18 months owes more to him than any signing.",
      "The role of his coaching can be seen in the improvement of individuals across the squad. But it is even clearer in the collective. Arsenal have become the best side in the division defensively. Key performance indicators suggest they are up there offensively too.",
      "There remains a curious reluctance to praise his work. But this is what Arteta has created. A team rivalling the elite. A manager in his first job going toe to toe with two of the best in modern history in Pep Guardiola and Klopp. He deserves better than the trivial focus on how he and his players choose to celebrate.",
      "The goals are finally flowing for Rasmus Hojlund. Having not found the net once in his first 14 Premier League appearances, the striker, a £72m signing from Atalanta, now has four in four.",
      "His thrilling potential is shining through. It is a cause for celebration for Manchester United. But it would be hasty to say they have figured out how to get the best out of him. More accurate is that Hojlund has found ways of doing the job himself.",
      "Consider the fact that only one of his last five goals in all competitions, his late strike in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Newport County included, has been assisted by a team-mate.",
      "And even that goal, Sunday's opener against West Ham, was largely of Hojlund's own making as he collected Casemiro's interception with his back to goal before dummying his way past two defenders and brilliantly finding the bottom corner from the edge of the box.",
      "In total in the Premier League this season, a third of Hojlund's 24 shots have been unassisted. The same can be said for more than half of his 10 goals in all competitions. Without a reliable supply line, the Dane is having to generate his own chances.",
      "Wasteful finishing has been a factor too, of course. Hojlund missed nine big chances without scoring in the first half of the season, according to Opta. But the shot numbers are revealing.",
      "His average of 1.66 attempts per 90 minutes is the fifth-lowest of the 40 strikers to have played at least 400 minutes in the Premier League this season. Hojlund sits between Lyle Foster of Burnley and Sheffield United's Cameron Archer. It speaks to United's issues that their back-up striker, Anthony Martial, is even lower.",
      "Erik ten Hag spoke of improved service and better balance in United's front line after the win over West Ham, referencing the decision to switch Alejandro Garnacho to the right flank in recent games while restoring Marcus Rashford to the left.",
      "But the numbers show no tangible change to the number of chances Hojlund is getting. In fact, his four goals in four games since Boxing Day have come from only six shots, a total bettered by 73 players in the Premier League in the same timeframe.",
      "Across the four Premier League games in which Garnacho has started on the right with Rashford on the left, the pair have only found Hojlund with five and six passes respectively. He remains on the periphery, averaging only 26 touches per 90 minutes.",
      "Could it be that the responsibility lies with Hojlund himself? It seems unlikely given the quality of his movement. He ranks among the Premier League's top 10 players for attacking runs per 90 minutes and only slightly lower for runs challenging the opponent's backline.",
      "The problem is that United's wide forwards have other priorities. Rashford and Garnacho are averaging nearly twice as many shots as Hojlund. Given how infrequently they pass to him, it is hardly surprising they have only created six chances for him all season.",
      "It is to Hojlund's credit that he has found ways around the issue.",
      "Against Tottenham, a stunning finish slammed into the roof of the net after Rashford had been tackled while dribbling into his zone. Against FC Copenhagen, a rebound slotted home after Garnacho declined to square the ball to him for a simple finish.",
      "He is adapting, learning to rely on his own quality and intuition rather than the service of others. But for how much longer can he feast on scraps? Manchester United must find ways of feeding him properly if his recent scoring feats are to continue.",

      "From NFL to go-karting - football stadiums won't just be about football; Why stadiums should stay at the heart of cities; Sustainability must be 'at the forefront'; Why Barca, Real Madrid and Liverpool are re-purposing, not moving; 'Remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design'",
      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:40, UK",
      "It is not even 20 years ago that Emirates Stadium and Wembley Stadium were best in class for stadium design in the UK and around the world.",
      "While both are still considered excellent venues for hosting top-class football and events, there is no hiding the advancements in stadium design in such a short space of time, with the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, and other new stadiums around the world.",
      "But are brand new stadiums the future?",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. Could those plans include the renovation of Old Trafford?",
      "Last summer, as part of Sky Sports' Future of Football series, with the help of the architects designing and the clubs building the stadiums, we took a look at some of the key developments in stadium design and what could be around the corner in stadiums of the future.",
      "Are Man Utd getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Renovation and refurbishment is certain to play a huge part in stadium design in the future.",
      "We are already seeing that in Spain. The renovation of one of the world's most famous football stadiums is well underway as the Espai Barca project sees Barcelona upgrade the Camp Nou and renovate 18 acres of the area surrounding the stadium.",
      "Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.",
      "Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind.",
      "He said: \"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums.",
      "\"I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.",
      "\"First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,\" he added. \"There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be.",
      "\"You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so.\"",
      "Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event.",
      "Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people.",
      "For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority.",
      "Lee said: \"From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives.",
      "\"From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect.",
      "\"We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings.",
      "\"Every stadium and every location is different,\" he added. \"But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect.",
      "\"If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US.",
      "\"Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes.\"",
      "There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities.",
      "The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community.",
      "An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces.",
      "The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time.",
      "\"When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,\" Lee said. \"They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes.",
      "\"I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities.",
      "\"In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators.",
      "\"A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities.\"",
      "Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities.",
      "He said: \"We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community.",
      "\"We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays.",
      "\"It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities.\"",
      "Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue.",
      "The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as \"the world's first timber stadium.\"",
      "Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",
      "\"The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,\" he said. \"Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else.",
      "\"There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero.",
      "\"The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,\" he added. \"For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles.",
      "\"When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain.",
      "\"It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too.",
      "\"I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\"",
      "For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium.",
      "Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: \"In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability.",
      "\"At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall.",
      "\"We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building.",
      "\"Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud.\"",
      "Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more \"relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community\" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round.",
      "Barbany said: \"There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow.",
      "\"There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona.",
      "\"If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique.",
      "\"Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday.",
      "\"On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend.",
      "\"You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is.",
      "\"This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project.\"",
      "Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:\n\n\n“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.\n“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.\n\n\n“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.\n\n\n“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.”",
      "Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a \"catalyst for the digital transformation of the club\", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution.",
      "With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes.",
      "\"Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there.",
      "\"All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home.\"",
      "We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom.",
      "So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design?",
      "Populous managing director Lee said: \"The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design.",
      "\"None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses.",
      "\"But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience.\"",
      "\"Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world.",
      "\"It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,\" he added.",
      "\"We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game.",
      "\"The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally.",
      "\"Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see.\"",
      "So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years? Virtual and augmented reality is a topic we looked at in further detail in our Future of Football series.",

      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",

      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Erik ten Hag says Lisandro Martinez potentially suffered a \"very bad\" injury in Manchester United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday.",
      "Ten Hag added the injury to Martinez - who only returned from a long-term foot injury last month - is a \"personal disaster\" for the defender.",
      "Martinez suffered the issue when tangling with Vladimir Coufal as he attempted to shield the ball out for a goal-kick in the second half at Old Trafford and was replaced shortly afterwards.",
      "Asked how serious the Argentina international's issue is, Ten Hag said: \"I can't say but it doesn't look good. There is a bad concern.",
      "\"We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis. We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage.",
      "\"He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad, but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, the United boss added: \"It is very bad - very bad for him, very bad for the team. He is a very important player for us.",

      "Since he was brought back into the side, United have remained unbeaten, winning three and drawing one of their four games.",
      "However, they have actually won more points and conceded fewer goals per match without Martinez in the side in the Premier League this season.",

      "Manchester United have won four out of their last six games, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo impressing; both teenagers have stepped up for Erik ten Hag ahead of the season run-in;  watch Man Utd vs West Ham live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm",
      "Sunday 4 February 2024 12:28, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",
