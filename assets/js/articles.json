      "Tom Victor has been part of the Mirror Sport team since 2021. He reports on a range of topics, predominantly focusing on football. Tom has previously written for BBC Sport, Shortlist and FourFourTwo, among others, and is based in London.",
      "The upcoming Premier League season will begin against the backdrop of a summer of attacking spending. Champions Liverpool have been busy in the market as they aim to win back-to-back league titles for the first time in the Premier League era, but they are not the only ones.",
      "They're not the only ones, though. Just as Arne Slot's side have strengthened, their rivals have recruited in an effort to bolster their front-line.",
      "Slot only added Federico Chiesa to the squad last summer, while Joshua Zirkzee was Manchester United's only attacking recruit. Arsenal didn't add any new forwards in the summer of 2024, and that led to them being forced to move midfielder Mikel Merino into an unfamiliar No.9 role when injuries hit.",
      "This year, though, it's all change. Liverpool, United and Arsenal have all added at least two new faces to their front-lines, while the likes of Chelsea and Aston Villa also have new options up front.",
      "Liverpool were the Premier League's highest scorers last season by some distance, scoring at least 14 more than any other club. A significant overhaul in attack doesn't sound like the obvious next move, but there are reasons for it.",
      "The tragic death of Diogo Jota might have forced Liverpool to think differently about their front-line, but there were already reasons to begin looking at making tweaks. Mohamed Salah top-scored in the league last season with 29 goals, but netted just twice in the final nine games and will miss some action this term while away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Record signing Florian Wirtz and the versatile Hugo Ekitike will bolster a front-line already including Salah and Cody Gakpo, even if Wirtz isn't an out-and-out goal-getter, while Chiesa will hope to contribute more with a full pre-season behind him. Luis Diaz is a bigger loss than Darwin Nunez, but the Reds look well-stocked in the wide forward roles, with Slot pointing to full-back Jeremie Frimpong's ability to operate as a right-winger during Salah's upcoming AFCON absence.",
      "The big question concerns Alexander Isak. A new bid for the Newcastle striker could arrive before the end of the window, and there's an argument that a front-line currently on a par with United and Arsenal would be comfortably elevated to the best of the bunch if the Swede joins this month.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals last season, with Everton the only team to stay up while finding the net less often. The case for reinforcements up front was a clear one, and Ruben Amorim and the club's transfer chiefs got to work early.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived early, bringing with them a combination of Premier League experience and a strong goal return last term. Much has been made of the pair overperforming their xG numbers, but if they can get close to the 35 they scored between them last term then United will be laughing.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's impending arrival will take United's attacking outlay to roughly £200m - a little more than Liverpool's expenditure on Wirtz and Ekitike. He arrives without Premier League pedigree, but will hope to contribute more than Rasmus Hojlund managed last term.",
      "Hojlund could yet stick around, while Zirkzee remains as a rotation option, though Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are all tipped to follow Marcus Rashford in leaving either permanently or on loan. United have solid options on paper, but getting a brand new front three to gel represents the biggest challenge.",
      "Arsenal scored 91 goals in the 2023-24 season, and this was given as a justification for last summer's transfer policy. They were always at risk if injury struck, though, and it did so in a big way last term.",
      "Mikel Arteta would like to think being without Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli at various points in the season is not something likely to happen again. Even so, new transfer chief Andrea Berta has made sure the manager is well-prepared if there's a repeat.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has arrived to placate those who have shouted 'sign a striker' from the rooftops over the last couple of years, while winger Noni Madueke has arrived from Chelsea. Leandro Trossard could yet leave, while Gabriel Jesus won't return in time for the start of the season, but Ethan Nwaneri is a year older and more experienced and could contribute more.",
      "Gyokeres is an unknown quantity at this level, but the 54 goals he scored in 52 appearances last season don't count for nothing. The question, as with Sesko at United, is how quickly he can adapt to Premier League football.",
      "Manchester United still find themselves in third place, in part due to their lower starting point. Much will hinge on the manager as well as the personnel, with Amorim put to the test as he aims to bring three new faces together and create one coherent unit.",
      "Arsenal have a stronger base, especially with Havertz and Saka properly back after time on the sidelines last term. If the pair can get anywhere near where they were before those injuries, and if Gyokeres and Madueke hit the ground running (and introducing new parts to a working system ought to be easier than United's task) then they'll be in good shape.",
      "Liverpool's recruitment, combined with Salah's known quality, puts them more or less on a par with the Gunners as things stand. However, if they can add Isak to what they already have then it's hard to look past them as the top dogs in attack.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jorge Jesus has admitted he failed in an attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese midfielder was at the centre of an approach from Saudi champions Al-Hilal after suggesting he could leave Old Trafford at the end of last season.",
      "Fernandes was given a ludicrous offer that would have seen him bank more than £60million-per-year, with the Red Devils offered £105m for his services.",
      "However, despite revealing he had considered making the same move compatriot and former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo made, he opted to remain with United. And now it has emerged that Ronaldo’s current employers, Al Nassr, also made a tentative approach to try and sign the 30-year-old.",
      "Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus has confessed that he did hold talks with Fernandes, but was told that he wished to stay with Ruben Amorim. \"I wanted to [sign him], but Bruno is determined to stay,” Jesus told Sport Informa.",
      "“We already talked last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.",
      "“He's in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I don't agree. For me, it's the Spanish league.\"",
      "Fernandes will instead be the centrepoint of a United attacking spending spree that is set to eclipse £200m. Benjamin Sesko is set to be Amorim’s third recruit of the summer, joining from RB Leipzig in a deal worth £74m.",
      "The Slovenian will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo who signed after big money deals from Wolves and Brentford respectively. And it’s business United needed to complete after scoring just 44 league goals in last season’s miserable domestic campaign.",
      "The arrival of Sesko came after Fernandes made it clear that further improvements were needed. Speaking on their US tour, he said: “I don’t want to have a dig at anyone, but I think the club is doing the best they can in terms of all the financial situations they talk about.",
      "“I don’t know about it, I’m not involved in that. But obviously it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here.",
      "“We needed more quality to get everyone to step up a bit more and to have more to do to get into the starting line-up. I think that’s what the club and the manager are trying to do and hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”",
      "On his own transfer saga, Fernandes hinted that United’s defiant stance ultimately made his mind up. He said: . \"There was that possibility, the president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it. There was a waiting period for me to think about the future.",
      "\"As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so. I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go. The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.\"",
      "United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford in their final pre-season game on Saturday, before their Premier League season kicks off when they face Arsenal on August 17.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of completing a full refresh of their forward line for Ruben Amorim this summer. Benjamin Sesko is set to follow Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the doors at Old Trafford as the Red Devils attempt to put their goalscoring woes behind them.",
      "Sesko, 22, is set to undergo his medical before seeing a £73.3million deal to move from RB Leipzig confirmed as United's spending heads north of £200m in the transfer window. The striker opted for the 13-time Premier League champions over Newcastle United, despite the Magpies being able to offer European football.",
      "And despite this, the Old Trafford side were able to agree a smaller fee with the Bundesliga side to acquire Sesko's services. But that does not mean the forward came cheaply.",
      "Earlier deals for Cunha and Mbuemo paved the way for United to be able to make a third significant signing, despite concerns over the club's ability to abide by Premier League profit and sustainability rules. The club have a host of players up for sale including Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho but have so far only managed to move on Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "All of Rashford's salary is being covered by the Catalan club to help somewhat but United took precautions in order to ensure they could still pounce in the transfer market if required. The deals they agreed for Cunha and Mbeumo were pivotal to that.",
      "Despite costing in the region of £130m, the payments of that figure have been arranged in a way deemed favourable to allow United to keep spending, per BBC. That has proved advantageous in the quest to land Sesko, though the club may need more breathing space for a midfielder.",
      "Sesko's arrival could yet see Rasmus Hojlund depart Old Trafford. Despite the Dane being adamant he wants to fight for his place, United have made him available.",
      "The former Atalanta man, also 22, could be sold for as little as £30m with United willing to take a loss. Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes that tale should bring some caution.",
      "Scholes aired his concerns on The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed - going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",

      "While Manchester United may not be able to conclude a move for Carlos Baleba this summer, Ruben Amorim has cause for optimism. The Premier League giants have potentially registered interest in the Brighton midfielder too late to do a deal in 2025, but Amorim already has a fit for the same role.",
      "It's understood United have baulked at Brighton's valuation of the player, who would reportedly cost more than £100million. But there are signs to suggest their decision to hand Casemiro a contract until 2026 could prove to be a masterstroke.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined the Seagulls from Lille in a £23m deal back in 2023, but the Cameroonian, who has earned huge praise from United icon Roy Keane, enjoyed a breakout campaign last season. That alerted European powerhouses such as United, who may have to wait until next year to launch a realistic approach for the player.",
      "But the timing may work out perfectly considering Casemiro, who has the option of an additional year in his deal, is likely to part ways with the club in 2026. The Brazilian, who is among the Premier League's highest earners on £350,000 a week, often occupies a key role at the base of United's midfield, though there have been concerns around his longevity at 33 years old.",
      "United copped criticism in some quarters for awarding their £60m signing such a long and lucrative deal in the summer of 2022 when he was already 30. The Brazilian has endured some ups and downs during his time in England, though he enjoyed a resurgence last term with 42 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Only 24 of those came in the Premier League, yet Casemiro still managed 83 tackles, four more than Baleba despite him playing 10 games more. The United linchpin's total tackle rate works out at around 3.5 tackles per game, while Baleba's is closer to 2.3 per game.",
      "Despite boasting a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders of his generation, Casemiro has also proved himself a much more rounded threat than many perceive. He took 43 touches in opposition penalty areas during the last Premier League campaign, while Baleba had only 12.",
      "United's only other option as an established defensive midfield presence is Manuel Ugarte, who joined from PSG in a £50m deal last summer. The Uruguayan was one of the last statement signings made under Erik ten Hag's regime, however, and hasn't been the revelation fans were hoping for.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the other midfield gem with an important role to play in United's future, both in the short and long term. However, it appears he's better-suited to playing in a more advanced role rather than wasting certain attributes sat back.",
      "The powers that be at Old Trafford will be hoping five-time Champions League-winner Casemiro, who turns 34 in February, has at least one more stellar campaign in the tank. It then depends on whether United decide to trigger the one-year extension in his contract next year, or allow him to leave on a free and shed his huge salary from the wage bill.",
      "Brighton appear to have unearthed another rare gem in Baleba, as his supposed nine-figure valuation would suggest. And while this may not be the summer a move to Manchester materialises, the stars might align just right for him to take up Casemiro's mantle in one year's time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's Toby Collyer won't be used as a bargaining chip in a potential swap deal for Carlos Baleba. With the signing of Benjamin Sesko on the horizon, Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his midfield options, and Brighton's Baleba has been linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Brighton have slapped a £100million price tag on Baleba, and there has been speculation that United's young talent Collyer could be offered as part of the deal amid the troubling financial position.",
      "United will need to sell in order to buy again after committing a large portion of their wage budget on Sesko, whose £74m move is expected to be confirmed soon.",
      "Rumours had suggested that Collyer might be used to sweeten the deal for Baleba this summer, given that the 21-year-old came through the ranks at Brighton before leaving in 2022.",
      "It was previously claimed that the opportunity to sign Collyer was unexpected. He was considered one of the best midfielders in his age group, and a source at United confessed they were taken aback by the chance to sign him, but they were thrilled to do so.",
      "It seems likely that Collyer will be heading out on loan. \"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" he expressed during his time in the USA.",
      "He plans to have a discussion with the club's management about his future. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan,\" he said.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them. Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay.",
      "\"I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer made an impression last season when he debuted against Liverpool at Old Trafford, making 13 appearances overall despite a minor muscle injury. Last summer, insiders revealed Erik ten Hag's high regard for Collyer, and another source noted his exceptional 'freakish' running stats during training, surpassed only by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Amorim has also been vocal in his commendation of Collyer, noting the player's potential and work ethic in January, as he said: \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity.\"",

      "Sesko wore 30 for RB Leipzig last season, but that number already belongs to United new boy Diego Leon. When Sesko arrives at Old Trafford - and it now appears to be when rather than if - he'll have to choose an alternative.",
      "The No.11 he wore for Slovenia at Euro 2024 is also occupied, with Joshua Zirkzee going nowhere. However, 21, the number he wore as a teenager at Liefering, is likely to become available with Antony expected to leave the club.",
      "Sesko scored 21 league goals for Liefering in the 2020-21 season with 21 on his back. That's still his best single-season return in the league, though he netted 21 times in all competitions for Leipzig last term.",
      "United's move for Sesko will set them back up to £74million after an agreement was reached with Leipzig. He is due in for a medical on Friday after choosing Ruben Amorim's side over rivals Newcastle, and should be available for the Premier League opener against Arsenal a week on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's team might not be done there, though. Gianluigi Donnarumma continues to be linked with an Old Trafford switch, and reports on the continent suggest Lucas Chevalier - the man primed to take his place at Paris Saint-Germain - has passed his medical ahead of a big-money move from Lille.",
      "In terms of outgoings, Antony isn't the only one set to leave. Real Betis remain keen on the Brazilian after he thrived on loan with the club last season, though there is also interest from elsewhere amid questions over whether the La Liga side can meet United's asking price.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho are also expected to leave Old Trafford. Juventus have led the chase for Sancho for much of the summer, while Garnacho is the subject of renewed interest from Chelsea.",

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes believes Benjamin Sesko may have been better off choosing Newcastle over the Red Devils. After an extended transfer battle with the Magpies, United look to be closing in on the towering Slovenian centre-forward after a bid of £66.4million, and a further £7.6m in add-ons, was accepted by RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old is now jetting in for his medical as Ruben Amorim accelerates his transfer plans, but Scholes is concerned that United are shopping like-for-like. The 50-year-old is worried that Sesko hasn't got much more experience than under-fire United striker Rasmus Hojlund did when he signed for United in 2023, with the Dane's future now up in the air.",
      "The club legend believes the Magpies would have fostered a better environment for Sesko to develop, claiming strikers at United must hit the ground running while under intense scrutiny.",
      "Scholes aired his concerns for United's latest signing on The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed - going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "United have not only stolen a march ahead of Eddie Howe's side for Sesko, but have also beaten them to the punch for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who were signed earlier in the window from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Scholes, however, knows full well why United are a more attractive proposition than the north east side - but still isn't convinced it's the right deal for United to make.",
      "\"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle - if they ever do? Of course they are,\" Scholes said. \"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",

      "However, during the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund, who has scored 26 goals in 95 appearances for United, expressed his determination to secure a spot in Amorim's team.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said. \"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho might split opinion at Manchester United, but Lionel Messi has no doubts about the winger's talent. Garnacho, 21, is expected to leave United this summer, with Chelsea emerging as frontrunners for his signature.",
      "The Blues are understood to have agreed personal terms with the Argentine and have now opened talks with United. But they're still some way off reaching a full agreement.",
      "According to The Telegraph, United are holding out for £50million, while Chelsea are pushing to lower the price to around £40m. The London club's stance is strengthened by Garnacho's strained relationship with United boss Ruben Amorim, as well as the Red Devils' need to raise funds.",
      "United are on the verge of signing RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – a move that will push their summer spending towards, and possibly beyond, the £200m mark – with £130m already spent on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Garnacho struggled for consistency last season, despite registering a career-best return of 11 goals and 10 assists. His campaign was also overshadowed by accusations of attitude issues, fuelled by his public bust-up with Amorim.",
      "But while his domestic reputation has taken a knock, Garnacho's stock remains high abroad. He continues to be regarded as a rare, high-potential talent – a view, it appears, that's shared not only by international team-mate Messi, but also by several other Ballon d'Or winners.",
      "Garnacho was among the nominees for last year's Kopa Trophy – awarded to the world's best player under the age of 21. Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal claimed the honour by a wide margin, but Garnacho still earned the backing of some illustrious names.",
      "According to L'Equipe, Messi was one of three voters to place him third, alongside Karim Benzema and German great Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Dutch legend Marco van Basten went a step further, ranking Garnacho second. It underlines the esteem Garnacho still commands despite his recent troubles at United.",
      "Messi – an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner – has witnessed the youngster's talent first-hand on international duty.",
      "Van Basten – one of only five players to win the Ballon d'Or more than twice, claiming the prize in 1988, 1989 and 1992 – is widely regarded as one of the greatest forwards in football history. Similarly, Rummenigge – a two-time winner (1980 and 1981) – is generally classed as one of the finest attackers of his generation, as is Benzema, who took the award in 2022.",
      "Should Garnacho join Chelsea, he will face fierce competition for minutes. Like United, the Blues have overhauled their forward line this summer, adding Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Brazilian wonderkid Estevao. A move for RB Leipzig playmaker Xavi Simons is also in the works.",
      "Nevertheless, a switch to Stamford Bridge would offer Garnacho both a fresh start and a significant challenge – exactly what he needs at this stage of his career. At 21, he still has ample time to develop and prove his worth at the highest level, but the pressure to perform consistently will be intense, especially given the competition for places in a squad eager to reclaim its status among Europe's elite.",
      "Chelsea's ambitious recruitment drive signals their intent to build a youthful, dynamic attack, and Garnacho's pace and flair could make him a key figure in that vision – provided he can regain his focus and maintain discipline.",
      "For now, Garnacho waits in a cloud of uncertainty, but buoyed by the silent endorsement of some of football's greatest figures, the promise of a bright future remains unmistakably within reach.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma could face some interesting reunions if he ends up joining Manchester United. Italy's No.1 goalkeeper is reportedly interested in a move to Old Trafford, after Paris Saint-Germain agreed a £35million deal to sign Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "United have been busy in the transfer window, signing Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and they are also on the verge of buying Benjamin Sesko in a deal worth just short of £74m including add-ons. A move for PSG's goalkeeper is said to be difficult at present.",
      "But the situation may change if United are able to shift unwanted players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho – subsequently boosting their budget.",
      "In the Euro 2020 final, Donnarumma was seen arguing with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson at half time. As both teams went into the dressing room for the break, England were leading the Italians 1-0, thanks to Luke Shaw's half-volley in the second minute.",
      "But as Donnarumma strutted towards the tunnel, Henderson – an England substitute at the time – came out to confront the goalkeeper. The now Brentford midfielder was seen pointing at the penalty area while berating the goalkeeper.",
      "It's believed he took issue with Donnarumma's furious reaction to Raheem Sterling going down in the penalty area in the first half, which led to the PSG ace angrily confronting the forward. After Henderson approached him, a member of staff from the Italian team could be seen pulling Donnarumma away from the midfielder and down the tunnel.",
      "Italy, of course, went on to win the final on penalties – leaving Three Lions fans inside Wembley heartbroken.",
      "This summer, Manchester City have also been linked with a move for Donnarumma. This is seemingly ironic, as reports claim Pep Guardiola personally intervened to prevent a move for the Italian happening in the summer of 2023.",
      "PSG were believed to be so interested in signing City midfielder Bernardo Silva in 2023, they were willing to offer the goalkeeper and Marco Verratti in exchange. However, Guardiola was intent on holding onto Silva and was said to have personally ended any hope of the move happening.",
      "Two years later, City have been linked with Donnarumma again, as per Football Italia, despite the fact they recently signed James Trafford from Burnley.",
      "At the age of 18 years old, it was reported how Donnarumma had privately told his friends he was on his way to the Premier League.",
      "During this period, David De Gea looked certain to join Real Madrid, only for a fax machine to infamously scupper his move to the Bernabeu.",
      "United were the heavy favourites at the time, according to The Sun, and were confident they could wrap up a deal for the teenager back in 2017. However, Donnarumma performed a U-turn and proceeded to apologise to AC Milan supporters, ultimately signing a new long-term contract at the San Siro.",
      "After the move did not go through, he said: \"I'm delighted and proud to be at Milan. I was born and raised at this club and I never had any doubts about staying in my mind.",
      "\"I'm sorry to the fans who felt betrayed, but I repeat that was not my intention. I'm sorry to them and thank them for their affection for these two years. I am proud to be here.\"",
      "After Chelsea beat PSG 3-0 in the Club World Cup final this summer, Donnarumma and his manager Luis Enrique were furious with the antics of Joao Pedro. The Brazilian, who scooped the Blues' third goal over the Italian's head, was shoved in the throat by Donnarumma, while Enrique also wanted to get his own strike on him.",
      "Pedro, who joined the west Londoners from Brighton & Hove Albion for £60m this summer, fell to the floor, clutching his face. Donnarumma and Enrique continued arguing with Chelsea players, who also steamed into the scuffle.",
      "In the end, his shove on Pedro proved to be the most memorable moment of the post-match altercation. With Chelsea also previously expressing an interest in Donnarumma, it's possible the Italian and Pedro could yet become team-mates in the future, although United's hunt for a keeper appears more pressing right now.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's transfer business could next turn to signing a midfielder after wrapping up a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils have agreed to a £73.3million deal with RB Leipzig to sign the striker and beaten Newcastle United to his signature.",
      "Sesko will become United's fourth signing of the summer and will join on a five-year deal, with £66.3m to be paid in an initial fee and the remainder available through add-ons. The 22-year-old arrived on Thursday evening with his medical expected to take place on Friday as the club finalise the move.",
      "United's spending rises to a possible £214m but their business may not be done yet. After replenishing their frontline, a midfielder could next be on the agenda for the side.",
      "But, sales could prove important if the club want to make a further significant outlay. United are still hoping to facilitate moves for the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia this summer.",
      "The group are not in Ruben Amorim's first team plans thus far, with the latter trio being loaned out last season and Garnacho falling out with the Portuguese coach. United hope to bring in fees for each to improve their profit and sustainability standing.",
      "For the moment, United continue to be linked to blockbuster transfers however. One midfield target would appear to be Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "United made contact with the Seagulls through intermediaries to register their interest in Baleba, earlier this week. The 21-year-old was signed by Brighton in 2023 for £23.2m.",
      "The south coast side's demands could yet prove off-putting however. A £104m price-tag is said to have been placed on the youngster.",
      "And United's task has been made no easier after it emerged that local rivals Manchester City also hold an interest. ESPN claim that City's manager, Pep Guardiola, is a long-time admirer of Baleba.",
      "The Premier League star is said to be content to remain at Brighton for another season with a big-money move more likely in 12 months time. No direct contact has been made for Baleba thus far.",
      "When asked about Baleba's future, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told BBC Sussex: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me.",
      "\"So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens.",
      "\"We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

The Italian goalkeeper left the Rossoneri in the summer of 2021, a few months after losing to United in the Europa League.",
      "Four years on from that game, Donnarumma is being linked with a United switch - and not for the first time. His current club Paris Saint-Germain are said to have a deal in place for Lille keeper Lucas Chevalier, and it remains to be seen whether their current No.1 will stay and fight for his spot.",
      "It was back in 2017 that United were previously linked, only for the Italian to extend his stay in Milan. When United took on Donnarumma's Milan in March 2021, though, that deal had entered its final year with no sign of an extension.",
      "At the time of the first leg at Old Trafford, Stefano Pioli's Milan had relinquished top spot after successive defeats in February, including a 3-0 derby loss to Inter. United also sat second but with a bit more momentum, coming into the first leg after winning their own derby.",
      "It was a different case in Europe, where United had dropped into the Europa League after finishing third in their group below PSG and RB Leipzig. But they came out on top against Donnarumma and his team-mates.",
      "Amad opened the scoring at Old Trafford with his first ever goal for the club. Simon Kjaer grabbed a late Milan goal, though, leaving the game delicately poised - with the away goals rule still a factor.",
      "Just three members of United's starting XI from the away leg are still at the club: Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes (along with currently out-on-loan Marcus Rashford). A fourth current United player got minutes against them that day, with Diogo Dalot able to play against his parent club during a Milan loan and playing the final 25 minutes.",
      "It was one of United's subs who scored the winner, though. Record signing Paul Pogba came on for Rashford at the break, and took less than three minutes to score the only goal of the tie.",
      "Dean Henderson, not Donnarumma, who made a key goalkeeping contribution in that second leg. His big late stop denied former United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic and ensured the Red Devils made it through.",
      "They made it all the way to the final, eventually losing on penalties to Villarreal, and clinched second spot in the league. Milan were runners-up themselves in Italy, and Donnarumma decided it was time for a move after winning Euro 2020 with the Azzurri.",
      "Four years on, though, Donnarumma's next move could take him to Old Trafford. There will be no European football available to him this term, thanks to another Europa League final defeat for United, but he has a chance to leave Paris as a Champions League winner before taking on a new challenge.",

      "After tormenting the Three Lions at Wembley last year, Greece striker Vangelis Pavlidis could be on his way to the Premier League this summer. That's after Benjamin Sesko appears to have chosen Manchester United over Newcastle, leaving the Magpies scrambling for an alternative striker signing.",
      "Benfica frontman Pavlidis, 26, embarrassed a full-strength England line-up comprising the likes of Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka in the UEFA Nations League last October. He completed a match-deciding brace in the 94th minute as Greece beat England for the first time, moments after Bellingham appeared to have rescued a result for the hosts.",
      "Almost one year on from that upset, The Sun has reported Newcastle are considering a move for Pavlidis, who is understood to have an £87million release clause, following Sesko's snub. And there's a very real chance Eddie Howe soon finds himself short of a star attacker depending on Alexander Isak's future at St James' Park.",
      "The Swede is currently training separately from the rest of the Newcastle squad after expressing a desire to explore his options elsewhere. He abstained from Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia and then travelled to former club Real Sociedad for individual training.",
      "Liverpool remain closely linked with a move for Isak despite already spending a combined £170m on Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. The Reds recently had a bid for Isak worth a reported £110m turned down by the Magpies, but are said to be mulling a second offer.",
      "However, there's a chance that deal could be revived after Liverpool agreed to sell Darwin Nunez to Saudi side Al-Hilal for an initial £46m. That frees up another spot in the Anfield attack after Luis Diaz joined Bayern Munich in a £65.5m deal.",
      "Newcastle are said to have had scouts in attendance to watch Pavlidis in action as Benfica beat Nice 2-0 in a Champions League qualifier on Wednesday. The Greek hitman failed to find the back of the net, though it could work in Newcastle's favour that Benfica's latest striker signing, Franjo Ivanovic, did make his mark on the French Riviera.",
      "Pavlidis has scored already this season, however, after netting the only goal in Benfica's Portuguese Super Cup victory over Sporting CP. The Thessaloniki-born star scored 30 goals and laid on 13 assists in 57 appearances across all competitions for the Eagles last term.",
      "Benfica paid around £15m to sign the forward from AZ Alkmaar after he topped the Eredivisie scoring charts in the 2023/24 campaign. However, they look certain to make that figure back multiple times over if they sell this summer, even if Newcastle manage to negotiate a fee for less than his release clause.",
      "That being said, the chances of that happening may be slim considering Pavlidis has another four years left to run on his contract. The Telegraph reported Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is still understood to lead Newcastle's list of striker targets in the event they sell Isak this summer.",
      "Jackson looks certain to struggle for minutes this season after the Blues signed both Liam Delap and Joao Pedro in the summer. The Senegal international has the benefit of having already played in England's top flight.",
      "That being said, many fans on Tyneside may prefer to see their side take more of a risk given Jackson has been far from prolific in the Premier League. Pavlidis was also understood to be a potential target for the Red Devils before they seemingly won the race for Sesko, with Newcastle now possibly eyeing his signature after being forced to pivot yet again.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "There could be many reasons why Benjamin Sesko would rather play for Manchester United than Newcastle United. Money could be one of them, obviously.",
      "Perhaps, he would rather live in Manchester - or, more likely, South Cheshire - than on Tyneside. Maybe he is not overly fussed about Champions League football, or any European football, for that matter.",
      "After all, despite not taking Newcastle's higher offer, his wages will still be astronomical but his workload not so astronomical. But the most likely reason is that, for all its difficulties on and off the pitch, Manchester United remains Manchester United.",
      "It is still a behemoth of a club, it is still a global phenomenon. It still attracts 72,000 people through the gates and could attract double that amount if it had room.",
      "And whoever plays a key role in returning United back to the top of the Premier League will be feted like few others in the game. In the case of whether or not Ruben Amorim is the manager to perform that task, the jury is still out.",
      "He has talked a good game in pre-season, although his creation of a six-man leadership group seems a bit bizarre. On the evidence of last season, he has done well to find six leaders in that squad.",
      "But it is a squad that is considerably improved by the arrival of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and, when it is rubber-stamped, Sesko. For a start, there looks to be a natural attacking balance between those three but there should also be a mutual hunger.",
      "It may sound more than a touch idealistic but United’s new signings - and there could be more before the end of the window or even the start of the Premier League season - have a lot more to play for than a very heavy pay packet. Of course, there is a very big gap to bridge if United are to have a meaningful season-long battle with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "But while he played down decent form in the Summer Series in the States, a full pre-season will be crucial to Amorim’s mission. One of THE fundamental flaws of United teams over the last few years has been a very basic one.",
      "They simply have not looked fit enough. And they were certainly not fit enough to achieve the sort of work-rate that Amorim’s preferred system demands.",
      "That is why Amorim made sure the individual training regimes given to every player during their break were as detailed as possible. Word has it that the numbers from personal fitness tests have impressed the sports science staff.",
      "When they get their Premier League season underway with that blockbuster game against Arsenal at Old Trafford, expect to see a fitter, leaner United. And when he does arrive in training in next week, Sesko will certainly be fit and lean.",
      "This is a player who is quick, strong, scores goals and is good in the air - all qualities that have been rare at United for too long. He will not be some sort of saviour but the fact he wants to be at Old Trafford still tells you a lot about the club.",

      "Carlos Baleba is being courted by Manchester City as well as Manchester United amid speculation that the Brighton midfielder could yet move this summer for a massive transfer fee.",
      "Baleba, 21, has been a shrewd acquisition for Brighton, who snapped up the Cameroon star back in the summer of 2023 for £23.2million. Unfortunately for the Seagulls, though, the midfielder's stellar performances on the south coast have not gone unnoticed among their Premier League rivals.",
      "It emerged earlier this week that United had made contact with Brighton through intermediaries to register their interest in Baleba.",
      "However, it's now clear that United are likely to face significant competition in the race for Baleba's signature from their arch-rivals, Manchester City.",
      "ESPN outline that City's manager, Pep Guardiola, is a long-time admirer of Baleba, who made 34 appearances in the top-flight last season.",
      "City's interest in signing Baleba could pose a significant hurdle for United should they choose to pursue a deal for the midfielder, though Brighton will not sell one of their key players on the cheap.",
      "The same outlet claims that Brighton would demand a monster €120 million (£104m) transfer fee in order to sanction a sale to any of Baleba's suitors this summer.",
      "And with the Red Devils poised to sign Benjamin Sesko in a deal totalling £74m including add-ons, Brighton's demands would make it difficult for United to finance a swoop for Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "On Baleba's part, the player is said to be perfectly happy to stay with Brighton for another year if the chance to move before the 1 September deadline fails to materialise.",
      "United will focus on outgoings after finalising a deal for Sesko, who is scheduled to undergo a medical and sign for the club officially on Friday. A number of players, including Alejandro Garnacho, have been deemed surplus to requirements and any additional funds raised from player trading would potentially open the door to further incomings.",
      "Chelsea are interested in signing Garnacho and have opened talks with United with a view to striking an agreement for the Argentina international. Jadon Sancho and Antony are two other players who have no future at Old Trafford and are free to move on should any of their suitors reach an agreement with United for their services.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is reportedly interested in joining Manchester United, with Paris Saint-Germain closing in on the signing of a new goalkeeper. Donnarumma is widely considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he has played a key role in PSG's recent success.",
      "The Italy captain made 47 appearances across all competitions last season, helping PSG win the Champions League, Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France as they became the first French club to win a continental treble.",
      "However, Donnarumma is only under contract through 2026 and talks over a new deal appear to have stalled. According to a report from L'Equipe, PSG have agreed a deal to sign Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "The report states that a fee of €40million (£35m) has been agreed for the 23-year-old, excluding bonuses. PSG are hoping to finalise the transfer in time for their European Super Cup clash against Tottenham on August 13.",
      "As a result, Donnarumma looks set to leave Paris this summer and TEAMtalk are reporting that United have 'formally registered their interest'. The report states that United believe a deal would be 'very difficult' at the moment, but that could change.",
      "Donnarumma is said to be keen on a move to Old Trafford due to United's stature, even though they will not be competing in the Champions League next season and are coming off the back of their worst Premier League finish.",
      "Andre Onana is currently United's first-choice goalkeeper, but he has come under fire since joining the club from Inter Milan back in 2023 after making a series of high-profile mistakes. And when asked about his future earlier this summer, Onana said: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim, though, has backed Onana to enjoy a much improved campaign this year. \"I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers,\" Amorim told reporters.",
      "\"Even Tom [Heaton] is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay [Bayindir] did really well, and Onana is going to be better, like the other guys, this year. I think are we better in every detail, in the organisation of the day-by-day.",
      "\"The nutrition is better, the way we cook, what we eat, how we prepare training. I think that we are more organised. I think we have people now that help us to be better. I'm not concerned with small things and I was last year.",
      "\"So, those things help us and help me to think more about watching the game, watching the team. So it's a big help for me. When it's a big help for the technical staff, it's a big help for the players.\"",

      "Manchester United's Premier League campaign is just over a week away, but their transfer business could continue beyond then. Ruben Amorim's squad has been bolstered with the addition of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon, with all signs suggesting there's more to come.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is next in line, though - at the time of writing - a deal for the striker has been agreed but not completed, with a medical now set to be completed. United have also explored a move for Carlos Baleba, but it could be tricky to find the funds to sign the Cameroonian midfielder on top of a £70m+ deal for Sesko.",
      "United take on Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly on Saturday, looking to round off an unbeaten run of matches in Europe and the United States. The stand-out result was a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth, while Amorim's team also beat West Ham and drew with both Everton and Leeds.",
      "They will begin their Premier League campaign the following weekend with a blockbuster game against Arsenal. The Gunners suffered a second pre-season defeat on Wednesday, following up a 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Hong Kong with a home reverse against Villarreal.",
      "Christian Eriksen could be about to make an immediate return to the Premier League with Burnley. The Danish midfielder has been a free agent since leaving Old Trafford at the end of June, and opted against dropping down to the Championship with Wrexham.",
      "According to The Mail, Scott Parker's newly promoted Clarets have made contact over a potential move, though they face competition from elsewhere in Europe. If they succeed, they would reunite Eriksen with his former Tottenham team-mate Kyle Walker after landing the right-back earlier in the window.",
      "Burnley also confirmed the signing of former United loanee Martin Dubravka on Thursday. The Slovakian goalkeeper, who joins from Newcastle, played two cup games while on loan at Old Trafford during the 2022-23 season.",
      "Carlos Baleba is a player who United clearly rate highly, and their former captain Roy Keane agrees. Keane made a glowing assessment of the Brighton midfielder last season, before United's recent interest came to light.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said during Brighton's FA Cup run last term. \"Fantastic. Great example. The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "United are unlikely to be able to bring in Baleba this summer without raising significant funds, though the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund could yet move on. It may end up being a case of letting the midfielder spend another year on the south coast before swooping in 2026.",
      "If and when Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, he will be entering an environment which has a new set of rules in place. Ruben Amorim imposed a number of changes since arriving in November as the permanent successor to former boss Erik ten Hag, and he was the one who put those new rules in place.",
      "Some of the rules are specific to players, including banning them from going on holiday during international breaks. This is unlikely to be a big factor for Sesko, who is one of the first names on Slovenia's team-sheet, but others have been impacted.",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, while ordering players to pick up equipment if they lose the mini-matches played during training sessions. The final rule concerns coaches - getting them to simplify advice - but this too will affect the playing staff.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "When asked about Baleba's future, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told BBC Sussex: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me.",

If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens.",

      "Ruben Amorim is now nearing his third significant summer signing, with Sesko now in Manchester to complete his medical and sign his contract. The Athletic reports that a deal worth €75.6million (£65.5m), plus €8.5m (£7.4m) in add-ons, has been agreed to strengthen United's attacking line-up.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo became the second summer recruit following his long-awaited switch from Brentford, while the deal to bring Matheus Cunha to the Theatre of Dreams was more straightforward as his release clause was activated.",
      "The pursuit of Sesko has been widely reported, with the saga reaching its crescendo this week. Newcastle were first to have a bid accepted for the 22-year-old, before the Red Devils launched their own offer.",
      "The Bundesliga club ultimately gave the green light to both, leaving Sesko to make the final decision - opting for Manchester over Newcastle",
      "And the social media account of United striker Hojlund was among those, despite the fact that Sesko's arrival could mean increased competition for a starting spot.",
      "The MEN reported on Wednesday that the former Atalanta striker seems resigned to being pushed out by Manchester United once Sesko finalises his move.",
      "Sources close to the Dane have hinted that while being sidelined might boost Hojlund's performance, he may ultimately need to consider a transfer before the September deadline if he remains out of favour.",
      "His limited playing time could also jeopardise his spot in Denmark's national squad. His nation are on track to qualify for next year's expanded World Cup, but Hojlund lost his place in the team in June following a spell of just one goal in 15 appearances for his country.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund shared his determination to secure his position in Amorim's team. \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he declared.",

      "Sesko will sign a five year contract with the Red Devils, having sensationally snubbed a more lucrative offer from Premier League rivals Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side opened the bidding war earlier this week, seeing a second offer worth £71m up front accepted.",
      "However, the feeling was that the Slovenian was waiting on an offer from Manchester, which was launched on Wednesday. That deal will see Leipzig rake in £66.4m up front, add-ons of £7.6m and a friendly against the 20-time champions of England.",
      "The Bundesliga side ultimately accepted that proposal, leaving the player to pick his preferred destination. That proved to be with Ruben Amorim, despite reports that Newcastle had offered him a bigger salary.",

      "He will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively, in a new look Manchester United attack worth more than £200m. Amorim made attacking reinforcements his number one priority this summer after a dismal season which saw them finish 15th and score just 44 league goals in the process.",
      "Amorim's attention can now turn towards a new midfield player, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba at the top of their wishlist. The 21-year-old is the latest Seagulls star tipped for massive things, following the sales of players like Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Joao Pedro.",
      "Baleba has three years remaining on his deal at The Amex, with Brighton unwilling to sell at this point. Nevertheless, contact has been made via intermediaries with the Red Devils boss desperate to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park.",

      "Benjamin Sesko hid from photographers at Manchester Airport on Thursday night. There is no hiding place for a Manchester United striker.",
      "Never mind one who has cost £73.7million. Sesko is a strapping presence yet he may have to beef up his frame just to shoulder the burden of leading the line for United.",
      "Sesko was born in 2003, played in Austria and has been operating in one of Europe's top five leagues for budding Champions League qualifiers. Just like Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "So the minimum target for Sesko this season is 16 goals, the number Hojlund tallied in his respectable first campaign in England. Hojlun's overall numbers are cause to look away: 26 goals in 95 United appearances.",
      "Hojlund was always destined to fail. Switching to the same agency that represented Erik ten Hag marked his card with some teammates.",
      "One United player shook their head at the mention of Hojlund. Another lamented how few tackles he won, his lack of pressing and aerial sickness. A senior figure at the club questioned Hojlund's work rate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot have all given him short shrift on the pitch. Players were genuinely reluctant to pass the ball to Hojlund in his first season amid reservations about his hold-up play.",
      "In pre-season alone, Hojlund has vented at Dalot over a purportedly delayed pass. In Atlanta, he kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked at goal.",
      "It is ironic that John Murtough is now employed by Atalanta, having agreed an overall £72m deal with them to sign Hojlund in 2023. Since that transfer, Atalanta have won the Europa League, with Ademola Lookman scoring a hat-trick in the Dublin final against Bayer Leverkusen, and Mateo Retegui was the top scorer in Serie A last season.",
      "Hojlund mustered three goals in his last 35 United games. This is what United can do to a £70m-odd striker.",
      "\"I'm still very young,\" the 22-year-old Hojlund protested last week. \"I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals in the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "What Hojlund was essentially saying was that not everyone is like Erling Haaland in their early 20s. Haaland, like Sesko, cut his teeth at Red Bull Salzburg before rejecting United to move to the Bundesliga.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me,\" Hojlund assured us in the Soldier Field mixed zone, \"it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Hojlund insisted \"my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens\". Some of those close to him think differently.",
      "Sesko is a different profile to Hojlund. He was more renowned as a teenager and United tried to sign him three years ago when he was 19. Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic.",
      "United valued Sesko at £15m. Salzburg wanted £30m. Three years later, United have paid more than double. His fee is just shy of the £75m United parted with for Romelu Lukaku, their last Premier League-proven striker signing, in 2017.",
      "After Sesko joined RB Leipzig, it was telling that United still opened the doors to Basanovic at Carrington and Old Trafford, rather than burn their bridges. Keeping the line of dialogue open led to Matt Hargreaves greeting Basanovic and Sesko on the Manchester Airport tarmac.",
      "Sesko will likely line up for United for the first time against a club that was tipped to sign him. Arsenal will instead have Viktor Gyokeres at the apex of their attack. United enquired about Gyokeres before they turned to Sesko.",
      "That is another reality Sesko will have to blank out. Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Ollie Watkins were all sounded out before him. £73.7m is a steep fee for a fourth-choice striker. Delap cost £30m, Gyokeres went for a fee rising to £64m. There is no way Watkins would have commanded as much as Sesko has.",
      "Leipzig finished seventh last season. The only scrutiny on the reviled Red Bull franchise in Germany centres around their manufactured origins. They are a franchise club, anathema to the traditions of Germany's historic clubs. United is the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "As if this all wasn't onerous enough for Sesko, there is something he almost certainly hasn't considered. In my lifetime, there have been two forwards United and Newcastle United have vied for: Alan Shearer in 1996 and Wayne Rooney in 2004.",
      "That's the highest goalscorer and the third-highest goalscorer in the Premier League era. 468 goals between them. The leading scorers of Newcastle and United. They are English football greats not of the past 33 years but its entire history.",
      "That Sesko is mentioned in the same breath as them seems incongruous but it is fair. If he is mentioned in the same breath as them again in a different context, he will have been as totemic a buy as Fernandes.",

      "A senior United player assured the squad is \"very optimistic\" after a propitious pre-season tour of the United States, and that there is a \"much better feel\" around the camp.",
      "Other dressing room sources have described the atmosphere as \"very good\" and stressed the players benefited from team-bonding dinners in Chicago, where United were based for nine nights.",
      "Multiple United players enjoyed their stay in Chicago, where players could embark on sightseeing strolls with little hassle.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes' decision to remain at Old Trafford has also been particularly well received by the squad. Fernandes now fronts United's new six-man leadership group that also includes Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "United players were fully behind Amorim's decision to omit the 'bomb squad' members from the core squad's training sessions and tour. Marcus Rashford has now joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are still at the club.",
      "The quartet are still under instructions to report at United's Carrington training complex for sessions separate to the first team's schedule.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and trophyless last season, their worst since they were relegated in 1974. The campaign also marked only the second time United have failed to qualify for Europe in the past 35 years.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer will not be considered as a makeweight in a swap deal for Carlos Baleba.",
      "With the signing of Benjamin Sesko now imminent, Ruben Amorim is targeting the signing of a midfielder and Baleba has been linked with move to Old Trafford from Brighton.",
      "Reports have speculated Collyer could be used as a sweetener to sign Baleba this summer because the 21-year-old progressed through Brighton's academy before leaving in 2022.",
      "The MEN previously reported the chance to sign Collyer arose unexpectedly. He was regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country in his age group and a source at United admitted they were surprised to get the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",
      "Collyer was born in Worthing, which is around 10 miles from Brighton, and he was destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium until he was let go from the club.",
      "Collyer's future is still up in the air this summer, though. The midfielder has received loan interest and there is thought to be interest from other clubs in signing him on a permanent transfer.",
      "The current indications suggest Collyer will go on loan. \"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" he recently said in the USA.",
      "\"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.",
      "\"Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer made his Premier League debut against Liverpool at Old Trafford last season. He made 13 appearances for the first-team in total but was hampered by a small muscle injury.",
      "Last summer, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has also praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",

      "Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr failed in their attempt to sign Bruno Fernandes this summer.",
      "Earlier in the transfer window, Fernandes' future at Manchester United was uncertain and his agent met with Al-Hilal officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss a lucrative move to the Kingdom.",
      "Saudi reports claimed Fernandes had been offered a multi-million pound financial package to move to Al-Hilal. However, there was no formal contact between the clubs and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "It has now emerged that Al Nassr were also interested in signing Fernandes this summer.",
      "Al Nassr's manager, Jorge Jesus, has admitted he wanted to bring Fernandes to Saudi, but he was informed the midfielder had already committed to remaining in Manchester.",
      "“I wanted to,\" Jesus told Sport Informa when asked about signing Fernandes. \"But Bruno decided on staying. We had already spoken last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.\"",
      "In June, Fernandes touched on his desire to play at the highest level when he explained his decision to reject Al-Hilal. And former Benfica boss Jesus reacted: “He is in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I do not agree. For me, it is the Spanish league [La Liga].\"",
      "When Fernandes discussed his decision, he said: \"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me. They talked to my agent, but I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what I wanted to do with my future. Never did she say yes or no, or offer to make the decision for me.",
      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",
      "The Portugal international won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time last term, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players who have won it four times.",
      "Fernandes' contract runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United transfer news live blog on Friday, August 8,",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been busy this summer in an attempt to strengthen significantly following a disastrous 2024/25 campaign. Roughly £120million has been spent on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha and that figure looks set to rise further with Benjamin Sesko's arrival imminent.",
      "The RB Leipzig star opted for a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle United with a £73.8million (€85m) package deal agreed.",
      "Plans are now being drawn up for his unveiling and medical tests with the Slovenia international landing in Manchester on Thursday evening.",
      "Elsewhere, contact has been made for Brighton's Carlos Baleba with Amorim in need of a new central midfielder. A goalkeeper coming in is also a real possibility with the future of Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked, taking a fresh twist.",
      "With all of that being said, stay right here as MEN Sport bring you the latest United news and transfer rumours!",
      "The future of Rasmus Hojlund at Manchester United appears to be uncertain amid the imminent arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international is about to complete a £73.8million (€85m) switch from RB Leipzig to United with it no surprise the future of Hojlund is now up for debate.",
      "Reports from Italy have revealed that AC Milan are interested in signing the Dane on loan with an option-to-buy.",
      "However, transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has stated he wants to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford this season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko will sign his contract with Manchester United on Saturday at the latest, according to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg.",
      "The striker is currently undergoing his medical with the club, before putting pen-to-paper on a five-year deal.",
      "Manchester United will be desperate for a better season than their disatrous 2024/25 campaign.",

      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt praised Manchester United's signings in the summer transfer window when speaking to club media in the USA. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon have arrived thus far with the Dutchmen speaking fondly of all three.",
      "I think they have made a really good impression. Bryan [Mbeumo] has only been here a few days, so we can't say too much about him, but he's already scored some goals during training.",
      "I think we can be really happy with him. Matheus [Cunha] has been here for two weeks now and he's training really well. It's a new club and environment, but he's already been chatting and making jokes with teammates.",
      "I think that's a really good adaptation from him. Diego [Leon] is a little bit younger, but he is also a player with a lot of talent. He is really strong and physical.",
      "He comes from a different system, so tactically he has to learn a little bit, but all the physical and tactical abilities are with him to become a really good player.",
      "It's been a really good window and hopefully they can help us as much as possible.",
      "Manchester United may have to part ways with a club-record transfer fee in order to sign Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",

      "Every club has their price and according to ESPN, Brighton's is £104million with Manchester City also being credited with an interest.",
      "If that is the case, considering the funds already used on other signings, it seems highly unlikely Baleba joins.",
      "Though Chelsea remain keen on signing Alejandro Garnacho, an injury blow elsewhere may change their transfer priority.",
      "As announced by the Blues on Thursday, Levi Colwill has undergone surgery after rupturing his ACL in training. It is likely Enzo Maresca and Co. are yet to decide on how to proceed but it is possible the Garnacho deal is impacted, especially if they pursue another new centre-back signing.",

      "Hojlund's stock remains high in Italy thanks to his spell at Atalanta before joining United. It is claimed that AC could look to include an option to buy worth as much as £30m in 2026.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, PSG have agreed to sign Lille shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier for over £34.7million (€40m).",
      "With such a big fee spent on the 23-year-old, it seems unlikely he will not be the long-term No.1 which could result in Donnarumma considering a summer exit.",

Onana suffered a hamstring injury in the first week of pre-season training last month, meaning he has been in a race against the clock to try and get himself fit for the Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford a week on Sunday.",
      "Zirkzee was also pictured training in the latest images published by the club, suggesting his recovery is also heading in the right direction. He was rushed back from a hamstring injury for last season's Europa League final but suffered a different injury three weeks ago. After being left out of the squad that travelled to Stockholm for the pre-season opener against Leeds United last month, he was included in the squad that jetted off to the US, but he did not feature in any of United's three Premier League Summer Series outings.",
      "\"I've got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now,\" Zirkzee said during the tour. \"I've got great physios working with me every day. It's not a serious problem. It's pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",

      "Man United have been heavily backed to land Carlos Baleba this summer amid reports of interest. United are priced at 4/6 with Betfair with Chelsea out to 5/1 and Man City at 13/2.",
      "Betfair Spokesperson, James Mackie said: “Carlos Baleba has attracted the attention of Manchester United in what would look a huge boost to the Red Devils midfield if they can get the deal over the line before deadline day.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly open to allowing Rasmus Hojlund to leave on loan as they close in on a move for Benjamin Sesko, according to sources in Italy.",
      "Sky Italy now reports that the Reds are even willing to consider letting Hojlund leave on loan. It's said that AC Milan are among the frontrunners to sign Hojlund, with some reports suggesting they could put forward a loan offer that includes an option to buy.",

      "Plettenberg describes these sacrifices as necessary to push the move to Manchester United over the line.",
      "Sesko's medical is expected to take place within the next 72 hours."

      "Legendary Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has said there is \"no way\" Luke Shaw can still have a career as a left-back.",
      "After successive injury-hit campaigns, Shaw has high hopes of becoming a regular fixture in United head coach Ruben Amorim's plans this season.",
      "The England international, who joined United from Southampton in 2014, has played a prominent role in the club's pre-season, starting three of their opening four friendlies.",
      "Each start has seen him occupy the left-sided centre-back berth. Patrick Dorgu, Diego Leon and Diogo Dalot have all been given minutes at left wing-back.",
      "The wing-back role in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system demands high energy. The wing-backs are in place to service the forward players at the top end of the pitch.",
      "Amorim's approach with Shaw so far this summer suggests he sees his best position in his system in the back-three - and almost everybody is in agreement that is his strongest position in this particular shape.",
      "However, Scholes has gone as far as saying he does not believe Shaw will be capable of playing as a full-back or wing-back again.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Scholes said: \"He hasn't played a game for two years, has he? When he's fit, he is one of the very best.",
      "\"He has to [play at centre-back], there's no way he can get up and down the pitch anymore.\"",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment last November, Shaw had provided evidence he was capable of playing as a centre-back under former United manager Erik ten Hag, albeit in a back-four.",
      "A back-three system offers a little bit more scope for him to get on the ball and he is a solid operator when in possession, meaning he will be able to help United progress the ball up the pitch.",

      "United faced competition from Newcastle to sign Sesko, but they have won the race to secure the young striker, who is set to sign in an overall deal that could rise to around £74million.",
      "Sesko trained away from his RB Leipzig teammates earlier in the week while talks over his future advanced. He travelled on a private jet to Manchester alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, on Thursday evening and the 22-year-old is now set to undergo a medical to complete his transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "That raises the possibility of Sesko being unveiled at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon before United's friendly against Fiorentina, which is the final pre-season game of the summer.",
      "Newcastle made a more lucrative offer to sign Sesko from Leipzig, but the player's preference to move to Manchester was crucial and United officials moved swiftly to wrap up negotiations.",
      "United have already beaten Newcastle to the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer. United were in protracted negotiations to sign Mbeumo for over a month and privately believed the London club wanted Mbeumo to sign for Tottenham, Newcastle or Arsenal.",
      "The Reds have spent a combined £127.5million on Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo this summer, and completing a deal for Sesko would bring spending close to the £200m mark.",
      "When a transfer for Sesko is rubber-stamped, Ruben Amorim will have overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United mustered just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko has 39 goals in 87 appearances for RB Leipzig and his record for Slovenia (16 goals in 41 games) is strong.",

      "Manchester United's priority in the transfer market all summer has been resolving last season's goalscoring woes.",
      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last term than United, and three of them ended up being relegated to the Championship.",
      "But with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko looking like it is going to reach a successful conclusion, attention over the last 24 hours has turned towards what is next for United in the transfer market.",
      "It is hardly a secret that Ruben Amorim wants more dynamism in his midfield and after the departure of Christian Eriksen this summer, United need another body in midfield to compete with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo for a starting place.",
      "And their search has seemingly taken them towards Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba who is said to be a leading target for United this summer.",
      "The 21-year-old is an international teammate of United stars Mbeumo and Andre Onana and has impressed at Premier League level for the Seagulls across the last couple of seasons.",
      "His mentality and attitude are credited among his biggest strengths and, on the evidence of what we have seen during his time at the Amex Stadium, he is exactly the kind of player Amorim covets in his midfield.",
      "The problem is Brighton owner Tony Bloom is renowned as a master negotiator and a tough seller. Brighton have negotiated large fees for the likes of Moises Caicedo, Joao Pedro, Yves Bissouma, Marc Cucurella, Alexis Mac Allister and Ben White in recent seasons.",
      "Baleba will be a difficult and expensive transfer to make and while he may be one of United's top targets, they may well be forced to seek possible alternatives.",
      "With that in mind, using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Baleba, one of the top results is a little-known German midfielder who has been a revelation for Freiburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Patrick Osterhage joined the German side from Bochum last summer and made 30 league appearances last term to help his side almost qualify for the Champions League.",
      "The 25-year-old was seen as an astute buy and his ability to screen the back four at the base of their midfield was one of the big reasons behind their success last term.",
      "Speaking after his arrival at the Europa-Park Stadion, Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach not only praised his ability on the pitch but also cited his character away from the field as a big reason as to why they chose to sign him.",
      "\"We’ve had our eye on Patrick for a number of years,\" Hartenbach said.",
      "\"When he was younger, he battled through tough times thanks to his remarkable attitude. He can play anywhere in the midfield and we’re convinced that he still has a lot of potential.",
      "\"Patrick can pass well, but also likes to shoot himself. He’ll be a great addition to the side given his dynamism, pace and excellent stamina. We’re really excited.\"",
      "And while Osterhage's physical qualities would appeal to Amorim, that attitude is something the United boss is demanding from his United side.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way to do things now,\" Amorim said when discussing why United signed Mbeumo and Cunha this summer.",
      "\"It's not just how they play, it's really important of course, but the character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to know the players, to talk with everybody before we bring a player to our group. That is going to be massive in our decision to bring players.\"",
      "Transfermarkt value him at £8.68million and given he has the qualities Amorim seeks from new arrivals, he could prove to be an absolute steal as a possible Baleba alternative.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Ahead of last summer's transfer window, Alejandro Garnacho was one of only four players Manchester United deemed untouchable.",
      "United planned for mass changes ahead of the 2024 summer window - the first under Ineos' stewardship - and they were prepared to listen to offers for everyone within the squad except for Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund and Garnacho.",
      "Onana and Hojlund had arrived at Old Trafford the previous summer and Mainoo and Garnacho had established themselves as first-team regulars after coming through United's academy system.",
      "Now, just 12 months on, Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford and is running out of time to seal an exit. He has not featured in pre-season and has been relegated to the 'bomb squad' alongside Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Garnacho last played for United when they beat Hong Kong 3-1 in their post-season tour on May 30. His last competitive appearance came via the bench in the Europa League final just over a week earlier.",
      "Furious he had been left out of the starting line-up for the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, Garnacho used his post-match interaction with the media to let everyone know of his feelings.",
      "\"Obviously it’s hard for everyone,\" he said, reflecting on United's 2024/25 struggles. \"Our season was s**t. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Previously guilty of criticising former United manager Erik ten Hag for substituting him during a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in April last year, Garnacho also had to pay for a team meal by way of an apology for walking down the tunnel in response to being substituted against Ipswich Town at Old Trafford in February.",
      "Garnacho has developed an inflated sense of entitlement and has let himself down once too often. His activity on social media has also made headlines once too often.",
      "As talented as he is, United are, as has been well documented, better off rid of him. Reports of Chelsea stepping up their efforts to take him off United's hands are a blessing.",
      "Just like fellow wingers Marcus Rashford, who has already left Old Trafford this summer, joining Barcelona on a season-long loan deal, Sancho and Antony, Garnacho has no place in Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "The United head coach wasted no time in transforming United's style of play last November by switching to a wingerless 3-4-2-1 formation. Of the five wingers United had on their books at the start of last season, only Amad remains part of Amorim's plans.",
      "Criticised for not making the most of the seller's market in recent years, United have to cash-in on Garnacho before the window closes on September 1. There is literally no point in retaining a player that doesn't fit the coach's system and doesn't want to be at the club.",
      "Despite his attitude issues, Garnacho is a fantastic player with enormous potential. You don't make almost 150 appearances for United before celebrating your 21st birthday without having plenty of talent in the locker.",
      "On a personal note, Garnacho enjoyed a productive season last term, scoring 11 goals and registering ten assists in all competitions. It was an impressive haul given he had to adapt to a new formation less than three months into the season, meaning his stock is currently high.",
      "After being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby win over City at the Etihad Stadium in December, he fought his way back into the team and remained a regular starter. However, his comments after the defeat to Spurs in Bilbao marked the end of the road.",
      "He has put his nose out of joint once too often, and it is a shame considering how talented he is with a ball at his feet.",
      "However, United are at a juncture where they need to get a deal thrashed out before the deadline, get some much-needed cash in the bank and move on. With Amorim still in the process of transforming the culture and creating a team tailor-made for his vision, United will be the biggest winners of getting Garnacho off the books.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma could be set for some tense reunions if he makes a move to Manchester United this month.",
      "The Italian international is reportedly keen on a switch to Old Trafford, following Paris Saint-Germain's £35million agreement to sign Lille's Lucas Chevalier.",
      "United have been active in the transfer market, securing the signatures of Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and are also close to finalising a deal for Benjamin Sesko, worth just under £74m including add-ons.",
      "A move for PSG's shot-stopper is currently deemed challenging. But this could change if United manage to offload surplus players such as Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, thereby increasing their budget. Andre Onana's pre-season injury hasn't helped matters, and his shaky form last season means an upgrade could still come in.",
      "At just 18 years old, it was reported Donnarumma had privately informed his friends he was Premier League-bound. During this time, David De Gea seemed set to join Real Madrid, only for a notorious fax machine mishap to thwart his move to the Bernabeu.",
      "United were overwhelming favourites for his signature, as reported by The Sun, and felt certain they could secure a deal for the youngster back in 2017. Nevertheless, Donnarumma executed a dramatic change of heart and went on to issue an apology to AC Milan fans, eventually penning a fresh long-term agreement at the San Siro.",
      "Following the collapsed transfer, he said: \"I'm delighted and proud to be at Milan. I was born and raised at this club and I never had any doubts about staying in my mind.",
      "\"I'm sorry to the fans who felt betrayed, but I repeat that was not my intention. I'm sorry to them and thank them for their affection for these two years. I am proud to be here.\"",
      "This summer, Manchester City have also been associated with a potential move for Donnarumma. This appears somewhat ironic, as rumours suggest Pep Guardiola personally stepped in to block a move for the Italian in the summer of 2023.",
      "PSG were reportedly so keen on signing City midfielder Bernardo Silva in 2023, they were prepared to offer both the goalkeeper and Marco Verratti in return. However, Guardiola was determined to retain Silva and is said to have personally quashed any possibility of the deal proceeding.",
      "Two years on, City have been linked with Donnarumma once more, according to Football Italia, despite their recent acquisition of James Trafford from Burnley.",
      "During the Euro 2020 final, Donnarumma was seen in a heated exchange with ex-Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson at half time. As both teams retreated to the dressing room for the interval, England were leading Italy 1-0, courtesy of Luke Shaw's early half-volley.",
      "However, as Donnarumma confidently made his way towards the tunnel, Henderson – an England substitute at the time – emerged to challenge the goalkeeper. The now Brentford midfielder was observed gesturing towards the penalty area whilst admonishing the goalkeeper.",
      "It's understood he took umbrage at Donnarumma's heated response to Raheem Sterling's fall in the penalty area during the first half, which resulted in the PSG star confronting the forward. When Henderson intervened, a member of the Italian team's staff was seen escorting Donnarumma away from the midfielder and down the tunnel.",
      "Italy, of course, went on to clinch the win in the final on penalties, with Donnarumma saving spot-kicks from Sancho and Bukayo Saka, leaving Three Lions supporters inside Wembley devastated.",
      "Following Chelsea's 3-0 victory over PSG in this summer's Club World Cup final, Donnarumma and his boss Luis Enrique were incensed by Joao Pedro's behaviour. The Brazilian forward, who chipped the Blues' third goal beyond the Italian goalkeeper's reach, was shoved in the throat by Donnarumma, whilst Enrique also sought to confront him physically.",
      "Pedro, who made the switch to the west London outfit from Brighton and Hove Albion for £60m this summer, collapsed to the ground, grasping his face. Donnarumma and Enrique persisted in their heated exchange with Chelsea players, who promptly waded into the melee.",
      "Ultimately, his push on Pedro turned out to be the most memorable moment of the post-match fracas. With Chelsea having shown prior interest in Donnarumma, there's a chance the Italian and Pedro could become colleagues in the future, although, United's search for a goalkeeper seems to be more urgent at present.",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has suggested that Benjamin Sesko might have been better off opting for Newcastle over the Red Devils.",
      "Following a protracted transfer tussle with the Magpies, United appear to be on the verge of securing the towering Slovenian centre-forward after RB Leipzig accepted a bid of £66.4million, plus an additional £7.6m in add-ons.",
      "The 22-year-old is now flying in for his medical as Ruben Amorim steps up his transfer plans. However, Scholes has expressed concerns that United are simply replacing like for like and risk repeating history.",
      "The 50-year-old fears that Sesko doesn't have significantly more experience than under-fire United striker Rasmus Hojlund had when he joined the club in 2023, with his future at the club now uncertain.",
      "Scholes believes that Newcastle would have provided a more nurturing environment for Sesko to grow, arguing that strikers at United are expected to perform immediately under intense scrutiny.",
      "Scholes voiced his worries about United's latest signing during The Overlap Fan Debate. He said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs. Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready.",
      "\"It's got to be now. And Hojlund just isn't quite good enough for that as we've seen. But again, he's not had a chance to be developed - going to Newcastle might have been the best thing for him, for two or three years.\"",
      "United have not only edged out Eddie Howe's side for Sesko, but they've also outmanoeuvred them in securing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who joined earlier in the window from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Scholes acknowledges why United are a more appealing option than the Tyneside club, yet he remains sceptical about whether it's the wisest move for the club.",
      "\"Which club are going to be successful first? Are Man United going to win the league before Newcastle - if they ever do? Of course they are,\" Scholes added. \"That's why he wants to go there, but I'm saying, from a United point of view, is it the best bit of business? I still think you're in the same boat as having Hojlund.\"",
      "With Sesko's anticipated arrival and the acquisitions of Mbeumo and Cunha, it seems likely that Hojlund's tenure at United could be set to end. Insiders close to the Danish player suggest he might need to move before the deadline if he continues to be overlooked.",
      "Nonetheless, during the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund, who has 26 goals in 95 appearances for United, expressed his resolve to fight for his place in Amorim's squad.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he said. \"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has sent some fighting talk to Bruno Fernandes ahead of his first return to Old Trafford since his exit.",
      "De Gea spent 12 years at Old Trafford accumulating 545 appearances for United and winning the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup in his time at the club. In 2023, his association with the Reds ended after a prolonged saga at the end of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Then manager Erik ten Hag chose to replace De Gea as number one which led the Spaniard to choose not to renew his contract at the club. Andre Onana was signed as De Gea's replacement as Ten Hag looked to change the focus towards a more measured, distribution system from the back.",
      "United's former No.1 missed the entirety of the 2023/24 campaign as he decided what he would wish to do next. He did return to Manchester to train at National League club Altrincham before making the move to Fiorentina last summer.",
      "In the 2024/25 campaign, Ten Hag left United and De Gea established himself as the first choice for the Serie A club. Now, the 34-year-old returns to the Reds on Saturday as Fiorentina face Ruben Amorim's team in the last pre-season fixture.",
      "It is likely to be an emotional afternoon for De Gea who will reunite with some old friends including Fernandes. The captain has shared his excitement about facing off with the goalkeeper on social media, and now De Gea has sent a light-hearted jibe at the midfielder ahead of the game.",
      "In a video shared by United's social media team, De Gea said: \"As you know I am coming back to your home. For sure, it is going to be special for me.",
      "\"Bruno, you know you cannot score against me and if you score, it’s because I let you score so people will keep singing your name. No but, obviously, I cannot wait to see you my friend.",
      "\"I can’t wait to see you all at Old Trafford. So I’ll be there on Saturday, see you soon.\"",
      "United have confirmed that a pre-match presentation will be made to De Gea to mark his return to the club. More than 50,000 tickets have been sold for the fixture as United fans get their final look at their team before next week's opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of completing their fourth major signing of the summer with Benjamin Sesko in England to finalise the transfer.",
      "Should the move go as expected, Sesko will join Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in joining the Reds in Manchester this summer. The arrival of the Slovenian is seen as a statement of intent by United considering the competition from Champions League bound Newcastle.",
      "Of course, Sesko's imminent arrival has led to questions about the future of one man in particular. MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the rumours swirling around Rasmus Hojlund and the club in general this summer.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Milan club are now prioritising a move for Hojlund ahead of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic this summer. It is believed that AC would like the deal to be a loan with an option to purchase the Dane next summer.",
      "Hojlund's stock remains high in Italy thanks to his spell at Atalanta before joining United. It is claimed that AC could look to include an option to buy worth as much as £30m in 2026.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is an acceptance in Hojlund's camp that he may have to leave this summer should Sesko be signed to take his place in the squad. Were he to leave, a move back to Serie A could be ideal for him. Like United, AC are a historic club with a huge fanbase and the Dane could see this as the perfect team to rebuild his career. With the World Cup on the horizon, Hojlund needs to play and it just does not seem like he will do that at Old Trafford this season so why not move back to Italy.",
      "In an interview with Quotidiano Sportivo, Fiorentina defender Pietro Comuzzo has explained why he is happy to stay at the Italian club despite transfer links to United. \"The contract renewal was a strong signal from the club, a demonstration of respect,\" he explained.",
      "\"President [Rocco] Commisso is a wonderful person, and I have a special bond with him. When my mother passed away, he was one of the first to come and console me.",
      "\"This is also why I’m happy to have stayed here, in a city that is a second home to me.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Comuzzo is a player that is highly thought of in Italy and at only 20, he has a bright future ahead of him. However, the links to United have not been particularly strong as a centre-back is unlikely to be a top priority when other areas of the squad needed the finances more. Bringing in a goalkeeper is arguably more important than signing a centre-back but even that deal is subject to Altay Bayindir leaving. Perhaps United could go in for Comuzzo next summer - it will be interesting to see if this develops.",

      "Manchester United have been given fresh hope of arranging a transfer exit for Antony this summer after it was reported that Portuguese giants Benfica have entered talks for the forward.",
      "Upon Ruben Amorim's arrival at United, Antony's time at the club seemed to be heading towards an end. The Brazilian struggled to fit into the new system that Amorim introduced with wing-back and No.10 roles not suiting him.",
      "By January, the Reds had arranged for Antony to leave for Real Betis on loan where he enjoyed a career renaissance. Registering the same number of assists for the Seville club as he managed in 70 more matches for United, the La Liga side took the former Ajax man to their hearts.",
      "After helping Betis reach the final of the Conference League, Antony returned to Manchester and informed Amorim that he wished to seek an exit from Old Trafford this summer. Naturally, his old loan club re-entered the conversation to sign him but it is believed they are only willing to bring him in on loan.",
      "It is thought that Antony's sizeable wage is proving a problem for them. Now, Mais Futebol is reporting that Benfica have thrown their hats into the ring.",
      "Like Betis, Benfica have an existing working relationship having negotiated a deal for Alvaro Carreras in January 2024. Unfortunately for United, the similarities do not end there with the Portuguese club currently only willing to sign Antony on loan.",
      "It is claimed United remain in favour of a permanent exit and have set his asking price at approximately £43m. While Benfica have reportedly entered talks, RB Leipzig, Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen and Premier League rivals Brighton and Hove Albion are also thought to be showing interest.",

      "Alan Shearer has given his predictions for the upcoming Premier League season, suggesting that the top and bottom of the table could remain largely unchanged.",
      "Last season, Liverpool dominated the league with their fast start and consistent performances. Arne Slot's side have invested heavily in their squad, including the British-record signing Florian Wirtz, in a bid to secure back-to-back titles.",
      "The potential addition of Alexander Isak to Anfield strengthens Shearer's belief that Liverpool will retain their championship status. Manchester United, despite their disappointing performance last season and the addition of some high-profile attacking players, are not expected to make a swift return to Champions League football, according to Shearer.",
      "The pundit predicts that Chelsea and Newcastle United - two clubs with contrasting summer experiences - will both finish above the Reds. Newcastle's season could pivot on whether they retain Isak or secure a top-tier replacement.",
      "Chelsea, on the other hand, have had no trouble bolstering their attack. The Blues have added Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and are currently in talks with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Arsenal are predicted to finish second for the fourth consecutive year - a forecast that is unlikely to please Mikel Arteta. Despite significant investment in the squad, including the addition of Viktor Gyokeres as his No.9, Arteta may still fall short of the title he so desperately seeks, with pressure mounting.",
      "Manchester City had a disappointing season last term and are facing their first year without Kevin De Bruyne in a decade. Despite bolstering their squad, Shearer doesn't believe Pep Guardiola and his team will reclaim their crown, instead placing them third in his predictions.",
      "Nottingham Forest, last year's dark horse, will need to juggle domestic commitments with European commitments, either in the Europa League or the UEFA Conference League. Their fate depends on the outcome of Crystal Palace’s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a Europa League spot.",
      "Despite this new challenge, Shearer is confident they will remain in the top half of the table. Tottenham, having dismissed Ange Postecoglou despite his European triumphs, are entering a new phase.",
      "Thomas Frank faces a daunting task, but Shearer believes they will secure an eighth-place finish, just behind Aston Villa. The West Midlands club, who benefit from Unai Emery's leadership, are predicted to slip due to intense competition at the top.",
      "Brentford, now under Keith Andrews' management, are tipped to narrowly escape relegation, finishing just above the bottom three in 17th place. West Ham, with Graham Potter entering his first full season in charge, are also expected to face a challenging year.",
      "For clubs like Everton and Palace, it's another year of comfortable mid-table football. Fulham, Wolves and Bournemouth are expected to stay relatively safe.",
      "Brighton, sitting at tenth, might have anticipated more under Fabian Hurzeler. Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland have all made their return to the top flight.",

      "The attack has been the priority in the summer transfer window, but with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo now at the club, and with United leading the race to sign Benjamin Sesko, attention can turn to other matters. Baleba, 21, is an all-action defensive midfielder with his best years well ahead of him, and could add aggression and energy to the engine room.",
      "Signing Baleba would be very expensive, over £100m according to TBR Football, and some fans think that a deal should only be done for a considerably smaller fee. Brighton have done a roaring trade in recent years by buying young prospects from around the world and developing them into elite players, and then banking significant sums from top clubs.",
      "Some fans say that getting another top \"Premier League proven\" player in is exactly the sort of business that Manchester United should be doing - even if absences down to Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) participation is something to contend with. Reader Fanaticmanufan says: \"Bottom line is that we need a player of this calibre. If he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations, then Casemiro and Ugarte will need to cover this position!\"",
      "Commenter Icemu writes: \"We desperately need someone like Baleba.\" Un4u agrees: \"Please, we need Carlos in the team.\"",
      "Crazyeighty8 says: \"I dont know the Brighton lad but he looks like the type of midfielder we should buy, but never do. Today you need a player in the middle that's strong and athletic, we constantly get out-fought in midfield by mid-table or lower teams.\"",
      "The price will be a sticking point for Cantonalives: \"Thought SJR wanted to find players before they became really expensive... Happy enough with the summer activity so far, but frustrated how Brighton keep unearthing gems that turn into expensive players, when we do things the other way round.\"",
      "Cromwellswart responds: \"Hopefully, the Leon, Dorgu, Chido, Heaven and Kone signings is proof that the club are trying to unearth the rough diamonds. They're certainly proving promising so far. What we need to remember is that players will sign for clubs like Brighton knowing they can flourish and develop without the 24/7 pressure and bright lights of Old Trafford, and that players like Moises Caicedo may choose the Brightons and the Brentfords for that reason.\"",
      "Kevmal says: \"Baleba is a perfect fit for Utd, but way overpriced. 45m at best.\"",
      "DAVES writes: \"It's become apparent that Ugarte simply isn't good enough & must be replaced. Baleba ticks every box, but he won't come cheap.\"",
      "On our Facebook page, James Ikyerga writes: \"MU stands in good stead to buy him. They have splashed the cash on average players in the past. The player is damn good.\"",
      "Daffodial Maisamara isn't so keen: \"It will cost too much, and the sad thing is he will miss many games, just use what you've got.\"",

      "Manchester United are eyeing up a potential summer move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new central midfielder and Baleba, 21, has emerged as a top target for that position.",
      "The Cameroon international has three years left on his contract and United have contacted Brighton through intermediaries to explore a move to Old Trafford. The Reds are understood to be among the several suitors and interest is building in the ex-Lille man, who has impressed since his move to the Premier League in 2023.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, do not want to sell him until at least next summer. There is also a recognition that a move to United now might be unrealistic, especially if the Reds get a deal over the line for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Unless United are able to secure a number of lucrative sales, they are not expected to be able to afford a move for Baleba this summer. He is said to have a £100million release clause in his Brighton contract.",
      "But if United can sell a raft of players and sign Baleba, he would complete a 'dream' midfield for Amorim next season. Baleba would slot into the No.6 position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Next to Baleba in central midfield would be Bruno Fernandes. Yes, the Portugal international's best and preferred role is the more advanced No.10, but with new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo expected to be used as the two attacking midfielders, Fernandes is set to drop into a deeper position.",
      "A midfield two of Baleba and Fernandes has the potential to be among the best in the Premier League, that is for sure. Ahead of them would therefore be Cunha and Mbeumo with Sesko as the No.9.",
      "How would that leave the other midfielders in the United squad? Well, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte should be kept for much-needed competition, as should Mason Mount, who can be used anywhere across the midfield.",
      "However, in order to fund a move for Baleba, Kobbie Mainoo could be sold. The 21-year-old doesn't have a clear role in Amorim's system and United would be able to fetch around £70m for his services.",
      "It's a deal that would make sense all-round. United would make pure profit on a big-money asset and Mainoo would have the chance to be used in a more suited role somewhere else, such as Chelsea.",
      "Toby Collyer is the other first-team midfielder named in the United squad not mentioned thus far, but he would be kept as back-up and competition in case the Reds get a series of injuries throughout the season.",

      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nThe Brazil winger is being linked with Liverpool too but no-one’s heart is really in it – yet. We get the sense that Arsenal and Liverpool would be happy to take him, and Real Madrid would be willing to sell, but finding common ground over a price might be tricky. And the player seems to want to stay. If anything happens around Rodrygo, it feels like a late one. Arsenal certainly need a winger and Liverpool want another attacker if Nunez leaves.",

Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea enter the race now Levi Colwill is crocked.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nHaving missed out on Sesko, Newcastle have been linked to Jackson more than any other striker. The Blues’ asking price is £80-100m or £60m, depending on who you believe. According to Craig Hope, the Magpies striker shortlist is: Jackson, Rodrigo Muniz, Ollie Watkins, Jorgen Strand Larsen, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Lois Openda and Goncalo Ramos.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",

But we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation.",
      "",
      "12) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet.",

This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "7) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Mads Hermansen – Leicester to West Ham\nIt was going to be Big John Victor, but the “disgraceful” Hammers transfer team shifted to original number-one target Hermansen at the eleventh hour. Poor John. West Ham are reportedly closing in on the Leicester ‘keeper for £18m.",

      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have picked out ‘three’ potential replacements for James Maddison and will ‘meet all’ of Liverpool’s ‘demands’.",

      "Tottenham’s need for a new attacking midfielder has increased in recent days as Maddison has suffered an ACL injury and is set to be out for six to seven months.",
      "The north London side confirmed Maddison‘s injury in a statement on their club website on Thursday morning.",
      "The statement read: ‘We can confirm that James Maddison will undergo surgery for a ruptured Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in his right knee.",

      "New Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is also said to have ‘outlined his plans’ for Elliott to the versatile midfielder, while club chiefs are ‘willing to meet all of Liverpool’s demands’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources close to the deal have confirmed that Frank held direct conversations with Elliott last week, in which he pitched a vision of deploying the Liverpool attacking midfielder in the No.10 role. The former Brentford boss, recently installed at Spurs, is said to be a strong admirer of Elliott’s technical quality and sees him as central to his attacking plans.",
      "‘Elliott, who made only two Premier League starts for Liverpool last season, is understood to be keen on securing regular first-team football and views a switch to Tottenham as an ideal opportunity to stake a claim for a place in England’s World Cup squad next year.",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has highlighted the “only difference” between Hojlund and Sesko after highlighting concerns about the latter.",
      "Ferdinand said earlier this month: “The only difference is that Rasmus came in and had inexperience around him in terms of [Alejandro] Garnacho [on] one side and Amad [Diallo] [on] the other, for instance, most of the time.",
      "“If Sesko comes in, he’s got two players that have played Premier League, scored goals in the Premier League and backed up by Bruno [Fernandes], so I think it’s a different dynamic that he comes into.",
      "“But the uncertainty worries me a little bit. Can he adapt to this league?”",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent arrival means one Man Utd star is ‘resigned’ to the exit in a stunning ‘waste of investment’.",
      "According to reports, Newcastle United have made a ‘significant offer’ for a leading transfer target, while a striker is ‘pushing to join’ the club.",

      "Brighton and Hove Albion want £104million for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who is ‘happy to stay at the Amex’, according to a report.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in Baleba first emerged on Wednesday night when David Ornstein reported (after Indy-f**king-Kaila) that contact had been made via intermediaries.",
      "Ornstein told The Athletic: “Brighton made clear they favour keeping hold of the Cameroon international — who is under contract until 2028 with an option to extend by 12 months — for at least another year.",
      "“There is also a recognition on all sides that a switch now may be unrealistic, especially if United seal their proposed move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.”",
      "F365 SAYS: Carlos Baleba, not Benjamin Sesko, will make Man Utd a passable football team",
      "United have so far completed the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon, and Enzo Kana-Biyik this summer, and are set to beat Newcastle United to the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After signing Sesko in a deal worth a total of £73.6m, Ruben Amorim’s side will be under pressure to offload players.",
      "Selling Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, and Antony has always been part of the plan — but after committing to such a big fee for the Slovenian striker, it’s now imperative.",
      "And despite making no money from player sales so far this summer, United are being linked with a move for Baleba.",

      "Brighton don’t let their best players leave on the cheap — a fact players intending to use the club as a stepping stone are surely well aware of when they sign.",
      "Baleba falls into that bracket and has caught the attention of the Premier League’s big boys with his performances on the south coast.",
      "The Old Trafford club are clearly very keen on signing the Cameroonian, but he will cost over £100m, according to ESPN.",
      "The report claims that Brighton’s asking price is £104m, with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said to be a ‘long-time admirer’ of Baleba.",
      "United boss Amorim is also a fan, but signing Sesko will make the club’s pursuit of the Seagulls midfielder ‘more difficult’.",
      "Signing a midfielder is only possible if unwanted players are moved on, with Garnacho attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "It gets even worse for the Red Devils, as Baleba is reportedly happy to stay at the Amex this summer — with a ‘move considered more likely in a year’.",
      "The report adds that Baleba’s former club, Lille, have a 20 per cent sell-on clause for a transfer fee that rises above 30 million euros.",
      "Brighton are unlikely to budge from their steep asking price for the 21-year-old, having earned a reputation as one of the best-selling clubs in the Premier League.",
      "They’ve sold Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, and Joao Pedro to Chelsea for around £200m combined, while Benjamin White to Arsenal and Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool also brought in significant fees.",
      "Man Utd will have to look elsewhere this summer after Brighton made it clear that Carlos Baleba is not for sale, according to reports.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",

      "The Red Devils are currently working on completing a deal with RB Leipzig, with a report on Thursday morning revealing that more talks are ‘scheduled’ between the two clubs today after personal terms were agreed.",
      "United are favouring Sesko over Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins, though Ferdinand recently gave one reason for preferring his former club to sign the England international.",
      "Despite this, Ferdinand is expecting Sesko to thrive at Man Utd, even though he has two concerns relating to his inexperience and lack of time he will be given to settle in.",
      "“Wow. Huge money, £70m being spent,” he said on his Rio Presents YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Sesko over Watkins? Man Utd take Hojlund, Zirkzee risk again over what’s really important",
      "“Listen, he’s a young guy, been at Leipzig, playing, scoring goals. Last season, he played 45 games and scored 21 goals, six assists, so the guy knows where the back of the net is. That’s almost one goal every two games.",
      "“Yes, it’s a different league, it’s the Bundesliga, but he does play international football as well, he scores in international football and he knows where the net is.",
      "“A lot of people are going to go and suggest, ‘Oh, has he got the experience?’, and I was one of those guys in that camp going, ‘Do you know what? Where is the player that can actually show the young, inexperienced strikers that we have at the club how to do things? In times of need, who do they look to?’",
      "“He’s going to have to step up and be that guy. Can he do it? Yes, he can do it, he’s got huge potential.",
      "“But one of the things, as we’ve seen in recent years, our strikers, when they come in the door here, you’re not afforded a lot of time, there ain’t a great amount of patience and you’ve got to hit the ground running.”",
      "Ferdinand has also broken down what will be different about Man Utd’s attack should Sesko join Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in moving to the Premier League giants.",
      "“What I would say is Manchester United scored 44 goals last season. They’ve now invested in three strikers at the top of the pitch that have between them 48 goals last season, so that’s four more than the whole Manchester United squad got last year so that’s a huge improvement in that sense,” Ferdinand added.",
      "“Two of those guys have played in the Premier League and scored goals here. Sesko, now, has to go and transform his form, his goals, his menacing play, at times, into the Premier League and that’s the big question.",
      "“What I would say is not only are the goals a step up, but I would say the mobility in the front areas now is something, as a defender, I’m looking at now and I’m thinking differently about Manchester United’s frontline.",
      "“I’m going to have a physical presence up there and I’m going to have a physical test from all three positions and I’ve got people that can run and move up there, they’re mobile. They’re the things I was asking for over the last couple of years up there so more of that.",
      "“You have to say the recruitment team have absolutely delivered in that department in terms of the mobility, the pace, the power.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on the progress of Benjamin Sesko’s medical ahead of his move to Manchester United.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down."

      "Back in January, Chelsea were one of two clubs interested in the 21-year-old, but United’s valuation of £60m was deemed too high. His subsequent falling out with Ruben Amorim, as well as being one of five players to tell the club he wants to leave, has made him available for a much lower fee.",
      "A loan with an obligation to buy is also not ruled out, with Chelsea and United having done similar business with Jadon Sancho. In that instance, Chelsea opted to pay a £5m penalty rather than the £25m agreed fee to permanently sign the Dortmund winger.",
      "Manchester United have been looking to sell Garnacho all summer, and that desire will only increase with the expected arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "As Manchester United close in on their new striker, who may prove to be the answer to their goalscoring woes but has more than a whiff of the Rasmus Hojlunds about him, David Ornstein revealed on Wednesday night that ‘contact’ has been made over a signing which will raise genuine concern among rivals that Amorim may actually have a passable football team to work with next season.",
      "While there can be no one missing piece to a puzzle which remains strewn across the living room floor, with a corner or two thought to have been eaten by the dog and others sucked up by the hoover, Carlos Baleba can be the centre-piece to bring the still disparate Manchester United together and grant supporters at least an idea of what a final image might look like.",
      "We’ve already questioned United’s linear transfer strategy this summer – the logic in completing one signing before moving onto the next rather than multi-tasking, to the point where Sesko has missed pre-season and any other additions look unlikely to join before the start of the campaign – but also, why this order when the midfield problem was so glaringly apparent under Amorim last term, having predated him for well over a decade.",
      "Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro have been signed for a not-so-small fortune, with not one single person convinced Manuel Ugarte is any sort of answer for United as the latest in that string of frankly terrible signings to occupy one of the positions in their laughably unstable midfield pivot. If only they had used the Harry Maguire money on Declan Rice.",
      "Amorim could have been describing almost any game last season as he reflected on their 0-0 draw with Leeds a couple of weeks ago.",
      "“The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes operated in one of the deeper midfield roles in that game and again in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth last week, and Sesko’s imminent arrival will see the captain take up that position in the best United XI, or at least the XI featuring all of United’s best players, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo playing ahead of him and off Sesko.",
      "That’s currently unworkable role for him. We will have to endure/be treated to the same soft-centred Red Devils, laughably at risk of being counter-attacked upon so long as any of Casemiro, Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo are forced to do the donkey work they’e either incapable of or unsuited to in order to provide Fernandes with the license to remain United’s creator-in-chief in that position.",
      "Baleba has correctly been identified as one of very few players capable of granting him that freedom. The 20-year-old made 4.22 combined tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, falling just short of Moises Caicedo (4.38), who made more in total than any midfielder other than Idrissa Gueye.",
      "United will no doubt be encouraged by Caicedo’s excellent second season for Chelsea, with the attraction of signing midfielders who have stood out for Brighton further enhanced by their continued excellence following moves to European giants, with Alexis Mac Allister a second outstanding exponent of the value in raiding the Amex following his key role in securing Liverpool their second Premier League title.",
      "United’s need for a dominant midfielder in no way makes their bid for a new striker unnecessary. No-one watching Hojlund toil last season will have any confidence in him being the No.9 who can score them 20+ goals per season.",
      "But we also think they could have muddled through without Sesko, using Cunha or Mbeumo as the central striker if need be, or just trusting they can provide enough of an uptick in creativity and quality in those inverted winger roles to bring either Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee along for the ride with them.",
      "Baleba arguably should have been their priority from the start of the transfer window, but absolutely should have been part of what will be a £200m spend from the destitute Manchester United by the time they get the Sesko deal is over the line.",
      "We’ve heard the sell-to-buy nonsense with regard to United throughout the transfer window and that’s the party line once again. ‘Unless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role,’ says Ornstein.",
      "They will come close to their greatest-ever summer spend even without securing what we’ve been told all along were the necessary sales of members of the bomb squad, so we can’t be sure they don’t have an extra £90m lying around for Baleba.",
      "But if he is indeed beyond them as things stand, it’s not too late to pull out of a move for another young, unproven striker to join the two United have already – whom the manager isn’t convinced by anyway, very reasonably preferring the experience and surety of Ollie Watkins – in favour of a midfielder who Fabrizio Romano reports Amorim quite rightly sees as the “perfect” foil for Fernandes, with the “intensity” required to make United a serious football team this season.",
      "Man Utd will have to look elsewhere this summer after Brighton made it clear that Carlos Baleba is not for sale, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on the progress of Benjamin Sesko’s medical ahead of his move to Manchester United.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million.",
      "As This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, we have our doubts.",
      "The overriding argument for Watkins is pretty compelling in our eyes: guaranteed goals. That is something United have notoriously lacked in recent seasons. They re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and he provided that for a year under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. He scored 24 goals in 38 games after Edinson Cavani bagged 17 in 39 the season before.",
      "Since their successful — albeit short-term — goalscoring exploits, United changed their striker recruitment philosophy to guys for the future. And how has that gone so far? Well…",
      "Rasmus Hojlund for £68million has been nothing short of a disaster. He needed 15 games to score his first Premier League goal, which did lead to a purple patch before an injury halted his goalscoring streak. Three in his last nine top-flight games of the season at least hinted he could pick up where he left off in 2024/25.",
      "He absolutely did not. The 22-year-old Dane registered four goals and zero assists in the Premier League last season. Joshua Zirkzee was even signed to unload some of the centre-forward burden, which didn’t help.",
      "Zirkzee was another inexperienced forward with no Premier League experience brought in by the club last summer. And just like with Hojlund, it’s proving to be a poor investment. Both players are young and can easily improve — even potentially become world-class — but these two case studies should be enough proof for United that no matter how appealing the prospect of signing Sesko is, they should have resisted the urge and gone all in on Watkins.",
      "There is an argument for why that’s not the direction United should have taken — and we’ll get to that — but how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team haven’t used the Hojlund and Zirkzee evidence to ensure they don’t make the same mistake is startling. Ronaldo and Cavani are important here as well. The former was signed when he was 36 and Cavani was 33. Yet they were reliable options in front of goal, something Hojlund and Zirkzee have failed to become.",
      "Ronaldo and Cavani are not the only strikers older than Watkins (29) signed by the Red Devils who thrived at Old Trafford. There’s also Zlatan Ibrahimovic — the club’s second-best post-Sir Alex Ferguson signing — Robin van Persie, and, a long time ago, Teddy Sheringham.",
      "The fact Watkins turns 30 in December means absolutely nothing in a footballing sense. Players keep themselves in the sort of shape these days that means he could still be flying for United six years from now. But, no. In classic United fashion, they’ve gone for the flashy new toy — whose upside is huge, we know — but who also has an incredible, potentially Hojlund-esque downside.",

      "The main issue with Watkins appears to be his resale value. In that respect, the best-case scenario is that Watkins performs at a high level for a few years and Saudi Arabia come calling with a huge offer that the player wants to pursue. The worst-case scenario is that he’s pants from day one and United are stuck with another high-earning, underperforming, big-money flop. Having watched Watkins in the Premier League for the last five years, that is very unlikely. And yes, so unlikely that we are completely writing it off, which we haven’t done with the prospect of Sesko being another Hojlund (or only a little bit better).",
      "‘Resale value’ can be disregarded when the player pays you back on the pitch, and that’s what Watkins would do at Old Trafford. His worst Premier League goal return came in 2021/22, when he scored 11. That was also the only season Watkins missed more than one game across a top-flight campaign. He played 38 out of 38 last term!",
      "It’s a Manchester United decision that’s just…very Manchester United, but there is some logic to it.",
      "United’s transfer philosophy changes every summer, and the mood this year is to only sign players who really want to play for the club. Sesko fits the bill, while Watkins wasn’t aggressively pushing for the move. That’s the biggest factor for United, we think.",
      "And then there were the selling clubs. Everything we said about Watkins could be worth nothing if Aston Villa have zero intention to sell the player. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have every intention to sell Sesko — but it was always going to happen on their terms.",
      "MORE: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko: Which striker should Man Utd sign?",
      "Arsenal reportedly preferred Sesko to new signing Viktor Gyokeres but were put off by the German club’s whopping valuation of the 22-year-old Slovenian: 90 million euros.",
      "That’s around £78.5m, and it’s what Newcastle United offered Leipzig for the player. United, knowing he only wanted them, went a little under that — offering £74m. Reports suggest that offer has already been increased to match the Magpies’, such is the Red Devils’ desire to get Sesko through the door and ready for their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "The fact Leipzig are open to negotiations, and most importantly, Sesko is desperate to join, holds more weight in the United boardroom than a guaranteed success in Watkins — even if that’s what Ruben Amorim’s side are desperately crying out for.",
      "And we might be blinded by Hojlund and Zirkzee’s performances. They don’t necessarily mean that every young attacker signed by United will turn out rubbish — even if nearly all of their major signings over the last 12 years have been just that. The trend has to break at some point. Sesko certainly has the potential and current ability to be the trend-breaker.",

      "Man Utd have agreed a deal to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko ahead of rivals Newcastle; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Thursday 7 August 2025 16:00, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest ended after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Manchester United are now close to signing the Slovenian forward, having beaten Newcastle to his signature.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who look set to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle's new offer is £69.7m as a fixed fee plus add-ons;  Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:39, UK",
      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Monday 4 August 2025 14:44, UK",
      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
